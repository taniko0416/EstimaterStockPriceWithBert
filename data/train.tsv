DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MIFCAU.N said on Thursday it will shift production of Ram heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, a move that lowers the risk to the automaker's profit should President Donald Trump pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement.Fiat Chrysler said it would create 2,500 jobs at a factory in Warren, Michigan, near Detroit and invest $1 billion in the facility. The Mexican plant will be “repurposed to produce future commercial vehicles�� for sale global markets. Mexico has free trade agreements with numerous countries.Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne a year ago raised the possibility that the automaker would move production of its heavy-duty pickups to the United States, saying U.S. tax and trade policy would influence the decision.If the United States exits NAFTA, it could mean that automakers would pay a 25 percent duty on pickup trucks assembled in Mexico and shipped to the United States. About 90 percent of the Ram heavy-duty pickups made at Fiat Chrysler’s Saltillo plant in Mexico are sold in the United States or Canada, company officials said.Negotiators for the United States, Mexico and Canada are scheduled to meet later this month for another round of talks on revising NAFTA. Canadian government officials earlier this week said they are convinced that Trump intends to announce his intention to quit the agreement.Trump has threatened to force the rollback of NAFTA, which enables the free flow of goods made in the United States, Canada and Mexico across the borders of those countries. He also has criticized automakers for moving jobs and investment in new manufacturing facilities to Mexico and prodded them to add more auto production in the United States.On Wednesday, Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp announced they would build a new $1.6 billion joint venture auto assembly plant in Alabama, drawing praise from Trump.Vice President Mike Pence praised Fiat Chrysler’s announcement. “Manufacturing is back. Great announcement. Proof that this admin’s AMERICA FIRST policies are WORKING!�� Pence said in a Twitter posting.Chrysler raised its output in Mexico by 39 percent in 2017 to 639,000 vehicles, according to Mexican government data. That made Fiat Chrysler the third-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico in 2017, after Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and General Motors Co GM.N. The United States and Canada are the principal markets for full-size heavy-duty pickup trucks, most of which are produced in the United States by FCA, GM, Ford Motor Co F.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T.Miguel Ceballos, FCA spokesman for Mexico, said the company in 2018 and 2019 expects more growth in Mexico, and the moment it stops producing the Ram Heavy Duty pickups it will start to produce the new commercial vehicle, “which still does not have a name,�� Ceballos said.“It is going to be for global distribution, at the moment the Ram is only distributed at the level of NAFTA,�� he said.Ceballos said there was no current plan to either reduce or grow the workforce in Mexico.GM has been readying a plant in Silao, Mexico, to build a new generation of large pickup trucks.FCA on Thursday said it also would make a special bonus payment of $2,000 to about 60,000 FCA hourly and salaried employees in the United States totaling about $120 million. Typically, U.S. automakers only pay bonuses to hourly workers as part of collective bargaining agreements.	1.137026239
(Reuters) - Superstorm Sandy may consign as many as a quarter of a million new and used cars and trucks to the scrap heap, a loss that could eventually lead to a spike in new auto sales, automakers and dealers said.So far, automakers have reported that some 16,000 brand new vehicles will have to be scrapped due to the killer storm that flooded coastal areas in New Jersey and New York. Many of them were stored at the port of Newark when Sandy hit.That figure may grow once the two biggest automakers by U.S. sales, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, announce how many vehicles they lost due to Sandy. By Wednesday, nine days after Sandy made landfall in New Jersey, neither GM nor Ford gave estimates of vehicles that are a total loss.Sandy, one of the largest storms to strike the United States, left more than 8 million homes and businesses in the Northeast without electricity. All but a handful of New Jersey and New York auto dealerships were back in operation by Wednesday, some operating on generator power.At least 121 people were killed in the storm’s rampage through the Northeast, including 80 in New York and New Jersey.Some consumers with damaged vehicles may need to replace them with a new car, which automakers have said will boost sales eventually, said Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association.But, Schienberg added, because of the distress caused by Sandy’s wrath, “Right now, I don’t think car sales are on the top of everybody’s mind.”Last Thursday, Toyota Motor Corp, No. 3 in U.S. auto sales, said that 30,000 of October industry sales were lost due to less customer traffic or delayed purchases by consumers.Each of the major automakers said they expected those sales to be recovered later in November or in December.Six of the leading eight automakers in terms of U.S. sales said on Wednesday that at least 16,000 new vehicles were damaged, and the lion’s share of those will have to be scrapped.Counting cars in consumer hands increases the total loss estimated to at least 266,000 vehicles.“We believe that between 100,000 and 250,000 vehicles currently in operation could be removed from used vehicle supply once all is said and done,�� said Laurence E. Dixon III, senior analyst with the National Automobile Dealers Association.That compares with the 325,000 cars flooded during Hurricane Katrina, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau.All major automakers are offering some form of financial relief, allowing owners to defer payments for up to three months for customers in areas hardest hit until the end of the year.Nissan Motor Co will offer employee pricing and discounted financing for Nissan and Infiniti vehicles in areas hit by Sandy through January 2. Nissan has 225 dealerships in the affected areas.GM, Ford and Chrysler are each offering $500 cash toward the purchase or lease of a new vehicle for those who lost one from the same automaker because of the storm.Hyundai, which lost 400 new vehicles to the storm, will cut the cost of a new replacement vehicle by $750. Toyota also announced on Wednesday that it would delay monthly payments for three months to people in affected areas who need to buy or lease a new vehicle because they lost a Toyota or Lexus in the storm.Honda Motor Co sent out 500,000 emails to its customers in the storm-hit region, and will handle deferred payments and lease extensions on a case-by-case basis, said Chris Martin, company spokesman.Nissan will have to scrap 6,000 new cars and trucks, the most of any automaker, according to Travis Parman, Nissan spokesman.Toyota is next with at least 4,825 vehicles damaged, most of which will have to be scrapped, said Jana Hartline, Toyota spokeswoman in California.Several carmakers lost vehicles stored at the port of Newark in New Jersey, including Toyota, which had about 4,000 new vehicles stored there.Green car startup Fisker Automotive said it lost more than $33 million worth of luxury Karma plug-in hybrids, 330 sedans priced at more than $100,000, at Newark.Auto dealers and the automakers in less densely populated areas of the country are able to store cars and trucks on their own lots. But in the New York-New Jersey area, space is at a premium, so a high number of vehicles are stored at the port rather than being shipped to dealerships, Schienberg said.GM lost an undisclosed number of new Chevrolet Spark subcompact sedans that were at the port that had been shipped from South Korea, the company said.The losses could have been higher, said Jim Cain, a spokesman for GM, who said many dealers moved cars and trucks away from coastal areas ahead of the Sandy’s arrival.Jim Appleton, president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, said auto dealers moved to higher ground when they could, having learned their lessons from Hurricane Irene which struck the state in 2011.	9.661774091
Elliott breaks 39-race drought with Richmond victoryBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeRICHMOND, Va. -- Reigning NASCAR XFINITY Series champion Chase Elliott was first off pit road under caution on Lap 218 of 250 and held the top spot the rest of the way in breaking a 39-race winless streak on Friday night at Richmond International Raceway.Elliott’s victory in the Virginia529 College Savings 250 trimmed his deficit to 21 points behind series leader Chris Buescher, who finished 10th. Elliott’s first victory of the season was also the first in 24 races for an XFINITY Series regular at RIR.“We always want to come and give our best shot and try to win,�� Elliott said. ��(Crew chief) Ernie (Cope) brought a great car, and the pit stops were phenomenal.“I’m just super excited to be back in Victory Lane.”Yes, Elliott won the event in the No. 9 JR Motorsports Chevrolet , leading a race-high 83 laps on the way to his first win at Richmond and the fourth of his career.Perhaps, the loudest noise, however, came from late model stock car star and Dale Earnhardt Jr. protege Josh Berry, who trumpeted his presence in his maiden XFINITY race at RIR with a seventh-place finish.During an 81-lap green-flag run from Lap 54 through Lap 134, Berry drove from seventh to second. In the latter half of the run, Berry trimmed a five-second deficit to Scott, the leader, to 2.6 seconds before Jeremy Clements�� wreck in Turn 2 slowed the action for the fourth cation of the race.Berry repeatedly lost positions on pit road, the last time because egress from his stall was blocked by the No. 6 Ford of Darrell Wallace Jr. He lost five positions under that sixth caution and restarted ninth on Lap 226 before recovering to finish seventh.“I need to do better on restarts, I need to do better on pit road, and I think we would have had a real shot at winning that race,�� said Berry, who is auditioning for potential partners in hopes of running a full XFINITY Series schedule for JR Motorsports next year. “I’m just so proud of this team. They brought a great car tonight.“I sure hope I helped (my cause) tonight. I’m just a short-track racer at heart, so tonight played into my favor.”Pole-sitter Kyle Busch came home second, 1.308 seconds behind Elliott. Brian Scott led 63 laps and finished third, followed by Joey Logano, Erik Jones, Regan Smith and Berry.“I wasn’t good enough all race long,�� said Busch, who led 78 laps, including the first 49, before Scott took a long stint at the front. “I don’t know where the long-run speed went.”NASCAR XFINITY Series Race - Virginia529 College Savings 250Richmond International RacewayRichmond, VirginiaFriday, September 11, 20151.

BEIJING, Sept 16 (Reuters) - China’s price regulator has summoned executives from Toyota Motor Corp over pricing policies and practices at the Japanese carmaker’s luxury Lexus brand, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.According to three China-based Toyota executives, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) earlier this month summoned Beijing-based executives at Lexus for questioning.Two of the executives, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject, said the NDRC questioned the Lexus leaders about the brand’s spare and replacement parts policies, including pricing.Takanori Yokoi, a Beijing-based Toyota spokesman, declined to comment on the information provided by the sources, but said Toyota would cooperate with Chinese authorities if there was an investigation into anti-competitive matters.Officials at the NDRC could not be reached for comment.Last week, Hubei province’s price bureau said it would fine the sales unit of Volkswagen’s joint venture FAW-Volkswagen Automobile Co Ltd 249 million yuan ($40.6 million) for fixing Audi prices.NDRC’s Shanghai branch also said last week it would fine the China sales unit of Fiat’s Chrysler 32 million yuan for operating a price monopoly.Those penalties have raised the possibility of similar fines being levied against other global players such as Daimler’s &lt; Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors Ltd’s Jaguar Land Rover, which are being probed for possible anti-competitive behaviour.

April 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Racing have pulled out of next month’s Spa Francorchamps endurance race after damaging their only car in testing.The Japanese team’s TS030 HYBRID was involved in an accident while testing at Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet, France last week.“Regrettably this damage is too severe to repair. A replacement monocoque cannot be produced and sufficiently tested to ensure reliability within the limited time available,�� a team statement said on Wednesday.“We are deeply saddened to announce this decision and our sympathies are with the drivers, team members and fans who have been anticipating the Spa race so eagerly,�� Toyota Racing Team president Yoshiaki Kinoshita said.“Since the accident we have looked into all options but unfortunately there is no alternative course of action open to us.”The team, including former Formula One drivers Alexander Wurz and Kazuki Nakajima, will now make their first appearance at the Le Mans 24 Hours in June.	-3.987471389
SYDNEY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Sales of new motor vehicles in Australia rose in December to cap off the strongest year on record, a sign consumers are still ready to splash out on big ticket items even while penny pinching elsewhere.Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Wednesday showed new vehicle sales rose 2.2 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted 98,264. That was also the highest monthly total on record and a hefty 17.9 percent higher than in December 2011.Sales of sports utility vehicles extended their barnstorming run with a rise of 5.8 percent in December to 26,502, an increase of 17 percent for the year.Sales of passenger vehicles rose 1.2 percent in December, while sales of other vehicles, including trucks, edged up by 0.2 percent.Industry data out earlier in the month showed new vehicle sales up 15.7 percent compared to December 2011.For December alone, Toyota retained first place on the sales ladder with 22.2 percent of the market. Mazda climbed to second spot with 10.0 percent, overtaking the Holden unit of General Motors with 9.1 percent.Hyundai moved up to fourth with 8.1 percent, while Ford dropped back a place with 8.0 percent.For all of 2012, Toyota again led with 19.6 percent of the market.

(Adds total sales figures for Canada, results from Canadian arms of Ford, GM, Honda and Toyota)TORONTO, April 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales inched just 0.2 percent higher in March from a year earlier, figures on Tuesday showed, but an independent auto industry analyst said the modest increase masked a solid performance during severe winter weather, especially in comparison with the record sales of March 2013.Canadian sales rose to 157,060 vehicles in March from 156,680 the year before, marking the second-best March on record, said Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.“Being up by a sliver isn’t shooting the lights out, but when put in the context of a never-ending winter and strong year-ago sales, then current sales levels should be applauded rather than scorned,�� he wrote in a report.Truck sales climbed 5.1 percent to 90,851 vehicles from 86,475 last year, while car sales went in the opposite direction, falling 5.7 percent to 66,209 vehicles, the DesRosiers report said.“Perhaps the biggest ongoing dynamic is the strength in the light truck market,�� he wrote. That trend is also evident in year-to-date figures, with truck sales up 6.3 percent and auto sales down 6.2 percent.Demand for Detroit 3 branded vehicles slipped 1.1 percent in March to 68,661 vehicles, the report said, while sales of other makers were 1.3 percent higher at 88,399 vehicles.Chrysler Canada, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , took the top sales spot, as strong demand for its trucks offset a slump in car sales.Car sales tumbled by 33.5 percent to 3,469 from 5,217, the company said. Truck sales climbed by 11.7 percent to 21,180 from 18,956. Chrysler Canada’s total sales for the month rose 2 percent to 24,649 from 24,173 in the same period last year.Year to date, Chrysler’s total sales were up 4.9 percent at 60,869 vehicles, with truck sales 10.8 percent higher and car sales down 21.4 percent. The company said the results marked its best first quarter and March sales since 2000.Total March sales at Ford Motor Co of Canada fell 10.7 percent to 22,390 vehicles from 25,082, DesRosiers�� data showed. Ford had not yet issued its own figures late on Tuesday afternoon.General Motors Canada, which was also expected to release its data on Tuesday afternoon, had a 7.8 percent jump in sales, DesRosiers�� report said. Total sales increased to 21,790 vehicles, from 20,218 in the same period last year.Toyota Canada Inc said its March sales rose 6.8 percent to 17,397 cars and trucks, lifting first quarter sales 6.2 percent above the same period last year.The results included March records for the 2014 Toyota Highlander and Toyota Tundra, the company said.Sales of Toyota-branded vehicles rose 5.9 percent in March, to 15,509, while Lexus brand sales soared 30.5 percent to a record 1,594. The company said it sold 294 Scion vehicles.Workers at Toyota Canada are expected to vote next week on whether to join Canada’s largest private-sector union, Unifor. The results will not be known until later in April.Honda Canada Inc reported a 6 percent rise in March sales to 15,292 vehicles. Sales of Honda brands rose 5.4 percent to 13,454 and Acura brand sales climbed 6.4 percent to 1,838.Year-to-date sales in the Honda division were up 8.7 percent to 28,099 vehicles, the company said, while sales in the Acura unit were 0.9 percent higher at 3,721 vehicles.In the United States, auto sales inched up more than expected in March after two months in which weather reduced demand, and at least two auto industry executives said a more robust sales rebound could come in April.Ford reported a 3 percent rise in U.S. sales; Toyota a 5 percent gain, and Chrysler Group, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s battered peso currency reversed losses on Thursday after weakening more than 0.6 percent following a tweet from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatening Toyota Motor Corp with a “big border tax�� if it builds a new factory in Mexico to build cars for the U.S. market.The peso MXN=D2MXN= slipped to 21.58 per dollar but then recovered to trade flat 21.45 per greenback.	-5.677183052
TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will idle production lines next week at its plant in Tianjin, northern China, due to weak demand for its cars in China amid anti-Japanese sentiment triggered by a territorial row, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper said on Tuesday.Toyota, which plans to halve its overall October output in China compared with a year earlier, may make deeper cuts in the coming months, the paper also said.Two of the Tianjin plant’s three lines will shut down for one week starting Oct. 22, affecting output of sedans such as the Crown and the Reiz. The third line, which makes models such as the Vios subcompact, will be halted for two days, on Oct. 22 and Oct. 26, the paper said. The Tianjin plant produced 500,000 cars in 2011, it said.Protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in September after Japan nationalised two of a group of disputed East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and the Senkaku in Japanese, by purchasing them from their private owners.In September, Toyota’s sales in China fell 48.9 percent from a year earlier, while Honda Motor Co’s sales in the country dropped 40.5 percent.	3.802379721
TOKYO (Reuters) - The presidents of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T said they have no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico, preferring to wait until after Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. President this month before deciding whether to make any changes.Automakers in the U.S. have been slammed by Trump for building cars in lower-cost factories south of the border, which he said costs American jobs. Pressure to curb that production intensified this week after Ford Motor Co F.N scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico after Trump harshly criticized the investment.“We will consider our option as we see what policies the incoming president adopts,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda said on Thursday at an industry gathering in Tokyo, when asked whether his company was considering any changes to a production plant the automaker is building in Mexico.“We produce cars in Mexico for markets including North America and Europe and we have no immediate plan to change this,�� Honda’s president and chief executive officer, Takahiro Hachigo, said at the event to mark the New Year.Trump has also said General Motors Co GM.N could become subject to tariffs on Mexico-made cars for the U.S. market, and that he would like to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed with Canada and Mexico.Toyota, Honda and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T, Japan's top three automakers, have production facilities both in the United States and in Mexico, while Toyota and Honda also operate plants in Canada. Much of the vehicles produced in Mexico and Canada and exported to the United States - the single biggest market for Japanese automakers.Toyota produces a total of around 100,000 pick-up trucks and truck beds each year at its plant in the state of Baja California, and plans to raise output to around 160,000 units by 2018. It is also building a plant in Guanajuato city which will have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019.Honda has two auto plants in Mexico, one in Celaya city and the other in Guadalajara city that together build around 260,000 cars and 100,000 motorcycles a year.In the year ended March, Nissan produced around 800,000 vehicles at its three plants in Mexico, nearly half of which were sold in the United States.	-5.677183052
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it is testing air-bag inflators made by Autoliv and Nippon Kayaku Co as possible alternatives to potentially lethal parts supplied by Takata Corp.A spokeswoman for Japan’s biggest automaker said the company wanted to ensure the parts were compatible with its vehicles before using them.Reuters had last week reported that Toyota would buy 13 million inflators from Nippon Kayaku to reduce its risk from Takata’s airbags, which are at the center of the biggest global vehicle recall for decades.��(Inflators) are not like stationery, which can be simply swapped. We need to test them first and make sure they’re safe,�� the spokeswoman said.Swedish-American firm Autoliv already supplies parts to Honda Motor Co. An Autoliv spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment while a spokesman for Nippon Kayaku declined to comment.Toyota already uses inflators by Daicel Corp, which it has determined to be safe.The company is one of several global automakers trying to find alternatives to Takata’s air-bag inflators, which have been linked to eight deaths and more than 100 injuries after exploding with excessive force and spraying shrapnel inside vehicles.More than 10 automakers have recalled tens of millions of vehicles since 2008 over safety concerns linked to the airbags.	0.5685675492
TOKYO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday that it expects group-wide global sales to climb 21 percent to 9.58 million vehicles in 2012 as it recovers from supply chain disruptions in the wake of last year’s earthquake in Japan and flooding in Thailand.The forecast, which includes sales at Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd, is in line with expectations after Toyota gave parent-only forecasts earlier.Toyota said it is targeting overseas sales growth of 18 percent to 7.26 million vehicles and a 30 percent rise in Japan sales to 2.32 million vehicles.	6.23774029
SAN JOSE, Calif. - (Reuters) - Arm Holdings, the British chip technology firm owned by Japan’s Softbank Group Corp, is joining with automakers General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp to establish common computing systems for self-driving cars, an effort the companies hope will speed development of the technology.Arm supplies the underlying technology for the processors found in today’s smart phones but does not make chips itself. Its ties to the automotive industry go back to the late 1990s, when automakers began to add computer chips to vehicles for functions like engine control and diagnostics.On Tuesday the company said it was helping to create the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, or AVCC, along with the two automakers and industry suppliers Bosch Corp [ROBSCJ.UL], Denso Corp and Continental AG. Also helping found the group are semiconductor companies Nvidia Corp and NXP Semiconductors, both of which embed Arm’s technology into their chips.With automakers and tech companies working on self-driving vehicles, analysts expect the number of chips in cars to expand. But the current test vehicles being used to develop self-driving software are using the same kind of large, electricity-hungry chips found in data centers. Across the industry, chip firms and automakers agree that the power diet and size of the gear must be cut drastically to fit into cars for the general public, to perhaps a tenth or less the levels of current systems.“I just came back from trips in the U.S. and China and had the opportunity to ride in four different types of autonomous vehicles. They were great prototype platforms for proving the software, but when I asked to look at the electronics powering these vehicles, it literally was servers in trunks,�� Chet Babla, Arm’s vice president of automotive, told Reuters in an interview. “We’ve got a long way to go.”The AVCC will be an independent group funded by membership fees from the companies that join. Arm officials said its work will be open to non-members.The group’s first task will be to establish a common computing architecture. That effort aims to make it easier for car companies to write software that will work on chips from different vendors, similar to how Microsoft Corp Windows-based software works on processors from Intel Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc.“The massive amount of technological innovation required to power fully self-driving vehicles at scale requires collaboration at an industry level,�� Massimo Osella, chairman of the new group’s board and a lab group manager for research and development at GM, said in a statement.	8.555747688
JAKARTA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Automobile sales in Indonesia are likely to grow 10 percent next year boosted by an improvement in the economy, an official at an industry association told Reuters on Friday.Indonesia’s automobile sales were 764,683 from January to the end of September, said Noegardjito, secretary general at the Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries, adding that next year’s total sales was seen at 1.1 million, compared with 1 million in 2015 and 1.2 million last year.Slowing economic activity and higher fuel prices have led to all automakers averaging lower sales in 2015, he said, although Honda Motor Co Ltd had bucked the trend by launching well-received new models that would see its overall market share rising to second from fifth in 2014.Toyota Motor Corp is Indonesia’s market leader, followed by Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd, Noegardjito added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An investment company is planning to offer a novel kind of fund that would offer U.S. investors direct access to foreign stocks, while tamping down the risk of currency declines, regulatory filings showed on Wednesday.Companies based outside the United States, such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, British American Tobacco plc BATS.L and Royal Dutch Shell plc RDSa.L, currently offer access to their shares on U.S. exchanges through what are known as American depositary receipts (ADRs).Those ADRs allow U.S. investors easily to trade foreign stocks, but the securities also gain or lose value based on the performance of their home currency against the dollar. That means a Toyota ADR traded in the United States could fall even if the Japan-listed stock stays flat - if the yen declines against the dollar.Over three years, for instance, British investors have gained 8.8 percent investing in Royal Dutch Shell, but the dollar-denominated ADRs have returned negative 18.7 percent, owing to the British pound’s dive.Precidian Funds LLC is planning to offer U.S. investors access to Toyota, Royal Dutch Shell, British American Tobacco and each of 15 other largely blue-chip stocks in a fund structure that could eliminate the risk of a falling foreign currency hurting the stock price.That said, investors using the products could also miss out on the benefits of a rising foreign currency.In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Bedminster, New Jersey-based company proposed offering each stock as its own “ADRPLUS�� exchange-traded fund.Unlike most funds, the ADRPLUS would use a legal structure like that used by gold-owning ETFs that could allow it to hold just one ADR and the derivatives it needs to hedge currencies.The filings did not disclose fees, ticker symbols, a scheduled launch date or a listing venue.Precidian’s chief officer, Daniel McCabe, declined to comment.	4.301380223

* Sales up 8 pct year on year* Highest monthly sales since March 2012WARSAW, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Polish new car registrations rose for the eighth consecutive month in January, with sales reaching a 22-month high, an industry monitor said on Tuesday.The Polish sales numbers add weight to data from other European countries on Monday, suggesting that Europe’s car market is strengthening after a six-year slump.Research institute Samar, which compiles Polish car market data, said that sales of passenger cars and small trucks registered in January rose by 8 percent year on year to 32,316, after a 25 percent rise in December.Some of the vehicles bought in Poland are re-exported, mainly to western Europe. Adjusted for re-exports, domestic sales stood at 29,366 cars.The top-selling carmakers in Poland are Volkswagen and its subsidiary Skoda, along with Toyota and Ford.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday said higher U.S. auto tariffs would ramp up the cost of vehicles produced locally along with those imported to the United States from Japan, which would have a ""big impact"" on its bottom line.Like its global rivals, Toyota is bracing for the possibility of a rise in U.S. auto import tariffs, which could cloud its outlook as it would raise the cost of selling vehicles in the world’s second-biggest vehicle market. Such uncertainty took the shine off strong quarterly results announced on Friday.So far, Japan’s biggest automakers and components suppliers said they have seen limited direct impact from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum implemented in June, but they acknowledge they could take a significant hit if Washington delivers on proposals to hike tariffs on autos and auto parts to 25 percent.“If we see a rise, it would raise the cost of locally produced vehicles by around $1,800 each, and increase costs for (models imported from Japan) by $6,000,�� Toyota senior managing director Masayoshi Shirayanagi told reporters at a results briefing, referring to U.S.-made Camry sedans, one of the automaker’s most iconic models.“This would be a big impact.”The United States is a major market for Japan's automakers, where Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T locally produce around half or more of the cars they sell in the country. The remainder are imported from Japan, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere.Based on the roughly 709,000 vehicles Toyota exported to the United States from Japan in 2017, the automaker could take an annual tariff-related hit of $4.25 billion on those vehicles alone.Higher tariffs would deliver a major blow to all global automakers as most, including U.S. ones, rely on imports to source the vehicles and parts contained in them which are sold in the United States.Earlier this week, Denso Corp 6902.T, one of the world's biggest components suppliers, said U.S. auto tariffs, if implemented, could wipe up to $720 million off annual profit. Ford Motor Co F.N last week said tariffs in general could cost it up to $1.6 billion in 2018 in North America. Toyota has been a vocal opponent of tariffs, arguing that 25 percent would increase the cost of its U.S.-made Camry sedan by $1,800 and $2,800 for its Tundra pick-up truck.The automaker operates 10 production plants in the United States, and locally produces just under half of all the cars it sells in the country. Its share of localised production is lower than the 75 percent of Honda and 60 percent of Nissan.Detroit automakers Ford and General Motors Co (GM) GM.N as well as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MI lowered their full-year profit forecasts last week amid worries escalating tariffs would hurt sales and profit margins.Earlier on Friday, Toyota posted a 19 percent jump in April-June operating profit to 683 billion yen ($6 billion), beating estimates and marking its strongest quarterly performance in two-and-a-half years on the back of higher sales and cost reductions in Asia.Its global retail vehicle sales rose 1 percent to 2.6 million units in the quarter, boosted by a lift in Asia, where demand for the recently remodeled Camry helped to increase sales by 5.4 percent in China, the world’s biggest car market, during the first six months of 2018.In North America, Toyota’s biggest regional market, sales rose 3.2 percent due to a rise in demand for its pick-up trucks, including the Tacoma and Tundra. Still, profit in the region fell 29 percent as sales incentives continued to weigh.The automaker maintained its full-year profit forecast at 2.3 trillion yen, a decline of 4.2 percent, though it now expects the domestic currency to average 106 yen to the U.S. dollar, from an earlier forecast of 105 yen.Overall, Toyota still expects a stronger yen to offset the benefits of cost-cutting and record-high global vehicle sales in the year through March.Separately, Toyota and Isuzu Motors Ltd 7202.T on Friday said they would dissolve their capital tie-up given limited progress made in their development partnership focusing on diesel engines. As a result, Toyota said it would sell off its 5.8 percent stake in the Japanese truck maker."	-7.075399848
* Insurers underperform on expectations for lower rates* Investors unlikely take positions ahead of FedTOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Tuesday but most investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of a U.S. central bank policy decision later in the week.The Nikkei share average fell 0.3% to 21,067.95 points by the midday break.Expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates has helped global markets recover from heavy selling sparked by intensifying global trade disputes.While the Fed Reserve is unlikely to cut rates at its meeting on Wednesday, its statement will be analysed for clues on possible near-term easing moves, analysts said.“The market has nearly priced in hopes for a U.S. rate cut eventually since the Fed chairman made remarks on June 4 suggesting a lower rate,�� said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities, adding that the Nikkei will likely trade around 21,500 in relief if the decision is in line with market hopes.Insurers underperformed on expectations for lower rates.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it will add two of its Lexus models to a recall it started in late 2009 to address the risk that a loose floormat could force down the accelerator.Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc said about 131,800 vehicles of the 2010 RX350 model and about 22,200 vehicles of its 2010 RX450H model would be recalled.Owners of the vehicles will receive a safety recall notification in early August. Lexus dealers will handle the vehicles at no cost to the customers, the company said in a statement.Toyota in September 2009 had recalled about 3.8 million vehicles in the United States, citing the floormat risk.Certain unintended acceleration claims that were made against some Toyota models have caused a worldwide recall of nearly 19 million vehicles from late 2009 to early 2011.Toyota maintained from the start of its worst safety crisis that the issue was linked to floormats pinning gas pedals down rather than a systemic electronic problem.US Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood in early 2011 announced that a federal probe essentially agreed with the company’s claim.The U.S. auto safety regulators in April this year announced a proposal that would require brake override systems -- that can stop a vehicle if the accelerator pedal gets stuck open -- on all new passenger cars and trucks, likely by the 2015 model year.(Reporting by Bijoy Koyitty in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)	-5.874282864
TOKYO (Reuters) - For a former James Bond car, it’s a chance to live twice.Japanese engineers put a new spin on an old classic car for a recent auto show, remodeling a Toyota 2000GT with solar panels and high-tech gadgets to make it 100 percent electric and solar-powered.Heralded as Japan’s first sports car when it came out in 1967, the vehicle was used in the James Bond movie “You Only Live Twice,�� released that same year, as a getaway car for the intrepid Bond, played by Sean Connery.But the new eco-friendly version comes with a catch -- it takes nearly two weeks for the vehicle to power up completely.“The engineer’s dream for this car is that the battery’s efficiency improves to the point that we could charge the car as we drive, and be able to drive without being limited by the need to stop,�� said Naohiko Saito, project manager at Toyota Motor Corp.The Achilles�� heel of electric cars for many sports car enthusiasts is the lack of horsepower, with many aficionados longing for the powerful revving sound of a speed machine.But the new version 2000GT comes with a playful solution -- a push of the accelerator brings a variety of sound effects, including meowing cats, clucking chickens and the sound of spaceships.“My personal favorite is the sound of horses�� hooves running,�� said Saito. “I can imagine that if this car approaches a regular vehicle, the passengers will be surprised to hear the sounds coming from it.”Only 337 models of the original automobile, designed by Toyota in collaboration with Yamaha, were made. It is considered a milestone in Japanese automotive history.There are no plans to mass produce the current vehicle, produced under the title “Crazy Car Project,�� but designers say it will race in electric vehicle competitions later this year.	22.85924834

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales inched just 0.2 percent higher in March from a year earlier, figures on Tuesday showed, but an independent auto industry analyst said the modest increase masked a solid performance during severe winter weather, especially in comparison with the record sales of March 2013.Canadian sales rose to 157,060 vehicles in March from 156,680 the year before, marking the second-best March on record, said Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.“Being up by a sliver isn’t shooting the lights out, but when put in the context of a never-ending winter and strong year-ago sales, then current sales levels should be applauded rather than scorned,�� he wrote in a report.Truck sales climbed 5.1 percent to 90,851 vehicles from 86,475 last year, while car sales went in the opposite direction, falling 5.7 percent to 66,209 vehicles, the DesRosiers report said.“Perhaps the biggest ongoing dynamic is the strength in the light truck market,�� he wrote. That trend is also evident in year-to-date figures, with truck sales up 6.3 percent and auto sales down 6.2 percent.Demand for Detroit 3 branded vehicles slipped 1.1 percent in March to 68,661 vehicles, the report said, while sales of other makers were 1.3 percent higher at 88,399 vehicles.Chrysler Canada, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FIA.MI, took the top sales spot, as strong demand for its trucks offset a slump in car sales.Car sales tumbled by 33.5 percent to 3,469 from 5,217, the company said. Truck sales climbed by 11.7 percent to 21,180 from 18,956. Chrysler Canada’s total sales for the month rose 2 percent to 24,649 from 24,173 in the same period last year.Year to date, Chrysler’s total sales were up 4.9 percent at 60,869 vehicles, with truck sales 10.8 percent higher and car sales down 21.4 percent. The company said the results marked its best first quarter and March sales since 2000.Total March sales at Ford Motor Co of Canada F.N fell 10.7 percent to 22,390 vehicles from 25,082, DesRosiers' data showed. Ford had not yet issued its own figures late on Tuesday afternoon.General Motors Canada GM.N, which was also expected to release its data on Tuesday afternoon, had a 7.8 percent jump in sales, DesRosiers' report said. Total sales increased to 21,790 vehicles, from 20,218 in the same period last year.Toyota Canada Inc 7203.T said its March sales rose 6.8 percent to 17,397 cars and trucks, lifting first quarter sales 6.2 percent above the same period last year.The results included March records for the 2014 Toyota Highlander and Toyota Tundra, the company said.Sales of Toyota-branded vehicles rose 5.9 percent in March, to 15,509, while Lexus brand sales soared 30.5 percent to a record 1,594. The company said it sold 294 Scion vehicles.Workers at Toyota Canada are expected to vote next week on whether to join Canada’s largest private-sector union, Unifor. The results will not be known until later in April.Honda Canada Inc 7267.T reported a 6 percent rise in March sales to 15,292 vehicles. Sales of Honda brands rose 5.4 percent to 13,454 and Acura brand sales climbed 6.4 percent to 1,838.Year-to-date sales in the Honda division were up 8.7 percent to 28,099 vehicles, the company said, while sales in the Acura unit were 0.9 percent higher at 3,721 vehicles.In the United States, auto sales inched up more than expected in March after two months in which weather reduced demand, and at least two auto industry executives said a more robust sales rebound could come in April.Ford reported a 3 percent rise in U.S. sales; Toyota a 5 percent gain, and Chrysler Group, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier.	-3.094146685
* Toyota posts largest quarterly operating profit in 4 years, beats estimates* Raises 2012 global sales target on strong demand* Toyota says careful to avoid same mistakes from boom years before 2008TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday posted its largest quarterly operating profit in four years and raised its 2012 global sales target on the strength of demand for cars like the Camry and Prius in key markets such as the United States and Japan.The world’s top automaker reported an operating profit of 353 billion yen ($4.51 billion), from a loss a year ago, a better-than-expected result that underscored its rebound from the natural disasters that blighted 2011.Toyota, which regained its crown as the world’s best-selling automaker in the first half of 2012, said it now expects to sell 9.76 million cars and light trucks globally in 2012, including the Daihatsu and Hino brands. That was up almost 2 percent from its previous forecast.The stronger-than-expected performance by Toyota contrasted with its closest Japanese rivals Honda and Nissan .“This was a good result with a boost from good demand in Japan and a lift from recovery in the U.S. market,�� said Koji Endo, managing director of Advanced Research Japan. “In addition to the raising their sales forecast, they saw a contribution from their cost-streamlining efforts.”Toyota’s profit for the quarter ending in June was higher than the average estimate of 314.1 billion yen based on eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Toyota raised its 2012 output target for Toyota and Lexus to 8.87 million vehicles, an upward revision of 2.5 percent that shows the strength of its core brands.But it retained its operating profit forecast for this financial year at 1 trillion yen, citing economic risks from the European debt crisis.The results mark the strongest showing for Toyota yet under Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the company’s founder, who took over as president in 2009 just as the company was sliding into crisis.Toyoda, a driving enthusiast, is credited with having rallied morale among dealers, suppliers and employees after damaging and costly recall campaigns for 19 million vehicles and the lost production that followed a massive earthquake in Japan and flooding in Thailand in 2011.But analysts and investors have questioned the cost of Toyota’s commitment to keep making 3 million vehicles per year in Japan because the strong yen saps the profitability of exporting those cars, including the Prius.Even after raising its global output target, Toyota still manufactures nearly 40 percent of its vehicles in Japan, compared with about 25 percent for Nissan and Honda.“I want to see the company managed in a way that reduces its dependence on exports,�� BNP Paribas senior analyst Koichi Sugimoto said.“It has been more insistent about maintaining a certain level of production within Japan and as a result, it is handcuffing itself on decisions such as developing next-generation vehicles or making new investments.”In its single biggest and most profitable market, the United States, Toyota sales have snapped higher by 28 percent through July, the biggest gain for any major automaker.The U.S. sales gains have been combined with higher transaction prices, reflecting strong demand for the Prius and the Camry sedan, the top-selling car in the United States.Toyota said it now expects to sell 2.38 million vehicles in North America in the financial year, an upward revision of just over 1 percent to its earlier forecast.Despite its rebound, Toyota executives said the company was determined to manage its growth more carefully under Toyoda than it had in the boom years before 2008. Executives have said Toyota lost its focus on quality and came to underestimate the company’s reliance on a weak yen in pursuing growth.“Unless we operate based on a solid recognition that growing our business means new risks, we are at risk of going down the same path as before,�� Toyota senior managing officer Takahiko Ijichi told reporters.Both Nissan and Honda, which released their quarterly earnings in late July, underperformed analyst expectations, citing the drag from the strong yen and costly sales incentives as they tried to shift older models before putting revamped models on sale.Shares in Toyota have fallen nearly 15 percent in the financial year that began in April. On Friday, they ended at 3,065 yen, up less than 1 percent but outperforming the wider market, which fell more than 1 percent.	-2.501547988
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will recall nearly 1.3 million cars globally for two separate defects, including 752,000 Corolla and Corolla Matrix vehicles in the United States to fix airbags that could be deployed inadvertently, the automaker said on Wednesday.It is the third Toyota recall since October to involve more than a million cars, and it comes as the company tries to recover from a damaged reputation following a series of recalls between 2009 and 2011 that were related to unintended acceleration problems.An IC chip in the airbag control unit can malfunction when it receives electrical interference from other parts in the car, causing the airbags to deploy when it is not necessary, Toyota spokesman Naoto Fuse said.Toyota is also recalling certain Corolla and Corolla Matrix vehicles in Japan, Canada, and Mexico.The problem has caused minor injuries such as abrasions in 18 cases that have been reported, he said. Two accidents have been reported by customers outside Japan, although Toyota has not been able to confirm them, he said.Toyota will add an electrical signal filter to the airbag control module to the recalled vehicles -- repairs expected to take an hour to hour-and-a-half, he said.The spokesman declined to disclose the costs involved.TRW Automotive Holding Corp has manufactured the airbag control unit in the vehicles, although the problematic chip is supplied by another company, an employee at TRW’s Toyota office told Reuters.He declined to say where TRW buys the chips from.The financial impact from the airbag recall is likely to be limited, possibly costing Toyota about 5 billion yen ($55 million), said Koichi Sugimoto, a senior analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo.Toyota may ask suppliers to compensate, he added.“While this cannot be ignored, this amount is not going to dent Toyota’s operations and share prices are unlikely to be impacted much,�� he said.Separately, Toyota will also recall 385,000 Lexus IS and its series, including 270,000 Lexus IS vehicles in the United States over wiper problems, Toyota spokesman Fuse said.The wiper arm nut of the front wiper in these vehicles may not be tight enough and the wiper may not work under certain weather occasions, including in snow.Toyota will exchange the nut in repairs that will take about 30 minutes, Fuse said.Toyota has been showing signs of recovery from the recall crisis and won back the crown as the world’s top selling automaker in 2012 from General Motors.In an effort to move past its safety crisis, Toyota proposed last month and got approval from a judge to spend $1.1 billion to settle one of the biggest U.S. auto class-action lawsuits over claims that millions of its vehicles accelerated unintentionally.Toyota has not admitted fault in proposing the settlement.As automakers including Toyota increasingly use shared parts for various models, the number of recalled vehicles have tended to balloon.In October, the automaker also recalled 7.4 million vehicles globally to fix malfunctioning power window switches, and in November it recalled 2.8 million vehicles for a steering glitch.Toyota is set to announce its October-December earnings results on February 5.(This story was fixed to correct figure in first paragragh)	7.413232673
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has designs on making robot helpers for your home, and has enlisted a Japanese startup that specializes in artificial intelligence to jump-start its plan.Japan’s biggest automaker and Tokyo-based Preferred Networks Inc will carry out joint research to develop so-called service robots that are “capable of learning in typical living environments��, the companies said in statements on Wednesday.The two firms have already been collaborating on driverless vehicles since 2014.Eighty-year-old manufacturing giant Toyota is trying to transform itself and adapt to technology, such as ride-hailing and automated driving, that is disrupting the auto industry.Toyota sees robots as part of that effort, particularly in Japan, where it aims to have them in homes and hospitals to support one of the world’s fastest ageing populations.For the project announced on Wednesday, Toyota said it would provide a dozen units of its Human Support Robot, or HSR, to Preferred Networks.The companies will cooperate on development over the next three years, including the sharing of intellectual property.Preferred Networks is already using the robot as a platform for its advanced artificial intelligence software. At an exhibition in Tokyo last year the robot tidied a messy room, distinguishing between trash and dirty towels.Toyota has been working on service robots since 2004, and has a number of models under development. But HSR is the one it sees as closest to being ready for commercial applications.Basically a single arm on a wheeled base with a sensor-filled head on top, the robot will also be used at next year’s summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, to help with simple tasks such as fetching drinks for some spectators.	2.690374952
BANGKOK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Thai automotive industry sales are expected to fall 13.6 percent to 1.15 million vehicles in 2014, mainly due to weaker consumption and slow economic growth, Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Monday.If Thailand’s political unrest is prolonged and economic growth is hit as a result, industry sales may miss that target, Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Motor Thai unit, told a news conference.The Japanese car maker is unsure whether it would increase investment in Thailand if its political crisis continued. “Our new investment in Thailand may not happen if the current political crisis goes on longer,�� Tanada said.Domestic auto sales fell 7.7 percent to 1.33 million vehicles in 2013, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).

Hamlin wins again from poleBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeDARLINGTON, S.C. -- You could call pole-sitter Denny Hamlin’s victory in Saturday’s VFW Sport Clips Help a Hero 200 at Darlington Raceway “dominating,�� but the NASCAR Xfinity Series event wasn’t without its share of drama -- courtesy of a fuel shortage and Hamlin’s own Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, Daniel Suarez.Hamlin led 117 of 147 laps at the 1.366-mile speedway but didn’t make the winning pass until Lap 145, when he surged past Suarez, who was stretching fuel after foregoing a final pit stop in hopes of stealing the victory.The win was Hamlin’s third of the season (all from the pole), his fourth at Darlington (all from the pole) and the 20th of his career.In a 1-2-3 finish for JGR, Kyle Busch got past Suarez, who finished third, to start the final circuit and came home as the runner-up. But Suarez secured a $100,000 bonus as the top finisher among eligible series regulars in the final Xfinity Dash 4 Cash event of the season.Suarez also won $100,000 for a Kurt Kolstad, a race fan paired with Suarez for the Dash 4 Cash finale.When Hamlin brought his Toyota to pit road under caution on Lap 72, he returned to the track after a lightning fast stop during which his team left the fuel cell slightly short of a full load.That meant Hamlin would have to pit before his primary pursuers, Busch and Kevin Harvick, and hope the race would run caution-free for the entire cycle of stops.Hamlin got his wish. After pitting on Lap 122 and gaining time on fresh tires, a relieved Hamlin saw the race run caution-free to the end, giving him just enough time to catch Suarez, who was saving fuel on old rubber, before the laps ran out.“I’m almost glad we didn’t (get the car full of fuel),�� Hamlin said after the race. “We didn’t want a caution to fall and trap us there, but I had scraped the wall and kind of misjudged my line one time and got a little right-side damage, and the car just stopped turning.“I don’t know if the right side would have made it or not (under the pressure of all-out racing).”Harvick led 16 laps and finished fourth. His chances were thwarted when the race ran green to the finish.“The 9 (Chase Elliott) hit the wall or was blowing up or something, and we stayed out a few extra laps, thinking that the caution was going to come out, and got a little bit behind,�� Harvick said.“The 20 (Hamlin) had the best car. We were better in the long run -- we could run him back down and race with him, but on the short run, those guys were a little bit better than we were.”Chris Buescher ran fifth and extended his series lead to 29 points over Ty Dillon, who finished 15th, and 35 over Elliott, who came home 24th, three laps down, after his engine soured late in the race.Joey Logano, Kyle Larson, Landon Cassill, Regan Smith and Ross Chastain completed the top 10.NASCAR Xfinity Series RaceVFW Sport Clips Help A Hero 200Darlington RacewayDarlington, South CarolinaSaturday, Sept. 5, 20151.

DETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp sales conference call: * US exec says industry sales in February will be up about 4 percent from samemonth last year, with a 15.4 million annual selling rate * Toyota US exec says doesn’t expect US sequestration budget cuts to haveimpact on March sales	-1.190941039
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will pay a record $1.2 billion to resolve a criminal probe into safety issues, in a deal that could serve as a template for how U.S. authorities approach a similar investigation into General Motors Co.The settlement between the Justice Department and Toyota includes an admission by the auto manufacturer that it misled American consumers about two different problems that caused cars to accelerate even as drivers tried to slow them down.The agreement comes as General Motors is also under investigation over its handling of an ignition switch failure linked to a dozen deaths. GM last month recalled more than 1.6 million vehicles 13 years after first noticing the issue. The payment Toyota agreed to marks the largest such penalty levied by the United States on an auto company, officials said.“My hope and expectation is that this resolution will serve as a model for how to approach future cases involving similarly situated companies,�� Attorney General Eric Holder told a news conference.Holder declined to discuss GM specifically but Preet Bharara, the chief U.S. prosecutor in Manhattan who joined him at the news conference, made a verbal slip and referred to the case against Toyota as one against GM. He quickly corrected himself.The Toyota settlement marked a huge victory for safety advocates who fought for years for criminal prosecution of automakers over safety violations.Although no individuals at Toyota were charged, the case was the first federal criminal case of its kind since the passage of the first U.S. auto safety law 48 years ago.“It means at the highest levels of the auto company, they have to worry about going to jail if they don’t report a defect,�� said Joan Claybrook, a former president of the nonprofit Public Citizen who favors stricter safety standards.Toyota’s North American legal chief Christopher Reynolds said in a statement that the settlement serves to put an “unfortunate chapter�� behind the company.“EFFECTIVELY ON PROBATION”The Toyota settlement resolves issues that have dogged the company since at least 2007 and have been linked to at least five deaths. The automaker still faces hundreds of private lawsuits.Prosecutors agreed to defer and drop the criminal charges against Toyota if it abides by terms, including allowing an independent monitor to review the company’s safety practices.The monitor, who will be approved by the U.S. government but paid for by the company, will be able to interview executives, take part in some meetings on safety issues and will have a toll-free number for Toyota employees to anonymously report violations.The automaker must report defects to regulators within five days of determining the problems could affect safety.Toyota is “effectively on probation for three years,�� said Bharara, whose office conducted the investigation. “It cared more about savings than safety and more about its own brand and bottom line than the truth.”John Alan James, a governance professor at Pace University in New York, said such provisions in the Toyota deal could serve as a blueprint used by prosecutors in any deal with GM. “The Department of Justice enforcement division is all lawyers, and lawyers live on precedents,�� he said.The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan is investigating GM’s handling of its ignition-switch recall. GM faces probes by Congress and safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as lawsuits from GM drivers who say their cars lost value because of the defects.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has been credited for apologizing quickly for the slow recall and promising to focus on safety. Toyota had played down the problems.However, GM is still under fire for failing to address the defective switches when they were discovered.A GM spokesman declined to comment on whether the Toyota settlement could be a model for his company.GM drivers have described accidents dating back to the mid-2000s in which engines spontaneously shut off, sending cars careening and disabling airbags before the vehicles crashed. Toyota drivers, by comparison, found themselves in vehicles cruising to speeds higher than 100 miles per hour while the brake pedals were functionally disabled.The 1966 Motor Vehicle Safety Act first required manufacturers of cars and trucks to notify the public of safety problems and to act if they find a defect.Congress has amended the law several times but did not add criminal penalties until 2000, and even then it was assumed bringing a case would be difficult.To prosecute Toyota, the Justice Department worked around those requirements by bringing its case under a wire fraud law that they use in cases from securities fraud to political corruption.A document prosecutors filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan says Toyota “defrauded U.S. consumers into purchasing its products by concealing information and making misleading statements about unintended acceleration.”Holder said federal prosecutors in New York “have been appropriately creative in crafting these mechanisms that can be used in similar kinds of cases to hold companies responsible for their actions.”Toyota said it would take a $1.2 billion after-tax charge for the settlement in the fiscal year ending March 31.Toyota dealers said customers have moved on. “It’s good to get this behind us, but we don’t hear about this at all from consumers,�� said Carl Swope, a Toyota dealer in Kentucky.‘LIES REPEATEDLY TOLD’The settlement resolves a four-year investigation by U.S. authorities, led by the New York FBI, which conducted more than 70 interviews.Federal regulators opened the 2007 inquiry into Toyota after reports of unintended acceleration by the Lexus ES350 model.The problems gained public attention two years later when a highway patrolman and his family were killed in an accident in San Diego that involved that model of Lexus.A 911 emergency call recounted the family’s last minutes: “We’re in a Lexus ... and we’re going north on 125 and our accelerator is stuck ... there’s no brakes ... hold on and pray ...�� The call ends with the sound of it crashing, prosecutors said.Toyota responded with a recall of millions of vehicles but left on the road some vehicles including the top-selling Corolla which was described within the company as having among the worst problems with floor mats that trapped acceleration pedals.The company also concealed from the public and regulators a separate problem with the acceleration pedal itself.In fact, the company canceled a design change to address the issue in the wake of the San Diego accident.“Idiots! Someone will go to jail if lies are repeatedly told. I can’t support this,�� one Toyota employee said after a meeting with regulators according to a statement of facts filed with the settlement.That employee’s comments came after he reviewed reports from Europe showing the severity of the problem.	0.9571601152
(Corrects headline and lead to make clear that the forecast was the first in 15 years to project a drop in sales for the year ahead, not that annual sales would drop for the first time in 15 years)* VW could overtake Toyota this year* Sales seen slumping in Japan, Indonesia* Sees China sales growth halving this yearBy Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp projected a drop in vehicle sales for the year ahead, its first such bearish forecast in at least 15 years, as flagging demand in Japan, Indonesia and other key markets raises the chance that Volkswagen will steal the industry crown.The forecast underscores Chief Executive Akio Toyoda’s resolve to steer the company through measured, profitable growth rather than chase volumes after getting burned by a capacity glut in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.Toyota said on Wednesday it expects 2015 global vehicle sales, including those of subsidiaries Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd, to slip 1 percent to 10.15 million vehicles.The world’s biggest automaker has not forecast a drop in annual vehicle sales since at least 2000, a spokeswoman said. That excludes a mid-year revision in 2011, when natural disasters temporarily halted production. Toyota did not provide initial forecasts for 2009 amid uncertainty during the financial crisis.CEO Toyoda has declared a three-year freeze on building new factories through the financial year to March 2016 to focus on becoming leaner and more profitable, even as Toyota took the top sales spot back from General Motors in 2012.Toyota expects growth in China, the world’s biggest auto market, to halve this year after sales fell short of its target in 2014 on the back of a slowing economy and political tensions between Beijing and Tokyo.In contrast, China, the world’s biggest car market, helped rival Volkswagen clock in growth of 4.2 percent to 10.14 million vehicles last year. The group’s aggressive expansion plans could see it reach a goal of overtaking Toyota this year, ahead of its self-imposed deadline of 2018.Toyota expects its parent-only sales to rise 0.4 percent to 9.18 million vehicles, with a 7 percent fall to 1.45 million in Japan, where a sales tax hike last year has hit demand. It expects overseas sales to rise 2 percent to 7.73 million vehicles, thanks to a healthy U.S. market.In 2014, group-wide sales grew 3 percent to 10.231 million vehicles.Toyota’s sales in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, fell 11 percent last year. The Indonesian automobile market is expected to remain weak in 2015 after the reduction of fuel subsidies.Toyota forecast its sales in Thailand will rise 0.9 percent to 330,000 vehicles in 2015 led by an increase in commercial vehicle sales. Its Thai auto sales shrank 27 percent in 2014 as domestic political unrest impacted consumer buying decisions.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Global automakers are cautious about their prospective sales in China’s vehicle market this year, the world’s biggest, as pressures such as slowing economic growth and trade frictions look set to continue.Sales in China, where more than 28 million cars were sold in 2018, are set to contract again for the second time in a row. The country’s top industry body, China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), said it expected annual car sales to drop 2% this year and will announce 2019 full-year sales figures later on Monday.Automakers had enjoyed double-digit annual growth in China as recently as four years ago before the brakes came on with sales contracting in 2018, the first annual contraction since the 1990s. Hopes for a return to growth in 2019 were later dashed by the chaotic implementation of new emission rules by local governments.The prolonged sales crisis has so far driven carmakers to consider shutting capacity and laying off staff. Top executives such as Geely’s founder, Li Shufu, to the president of Ford Motor Co’s partner Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd, Zhu Huarong, have said they expect fiercer competition to weed out weaker players.For 2020, bearish projections have come so far from the likes of General Motors, China’s second-biggest foreign automaker, which reported a 15% dip in 2019 sales last week.“We expect the market downturn to continue in 2020, and anticipate ongoing headwinds in our China business,�� said Matt Tsien, GM executive vice president and president of GM China.Volkswagen Group, whose sport-utility vehicle models have helped it to report a smaller 1.1% year-on-year drop in sales in the first 11 months last year, has said it expects the market to grow at a relatively low pace until around 2023 and 2024.Alan Kang, senior analyst at LMC Automotive, predicted modest sales growth of 0.05% this year.“The negative effect of cutting purchase tax in 2015-2017 has disappeared, and car sales in lower-tier cities are expected to recover. The easing of trade tensions between China and the United States has also helped restore consumer confidence,�� he said.The few companies still enjoying growth have been mainly Japanese automakers, data showed.Toyota Motor Corp sold around 1.62 million Toyota and premium Lexus cars in China last year, a 9% sales jump compared with a year earlier. Honda Motor Co’s China sales also grew 8% year-on-year to a record 1.55 million cars.Tesla Inc is also betting against the gloom, having started delivering China-made Model 3 vehicles from its $2 billion Shanghai plant this month. It saw sales double in the first 11 months last year to more than 38,000 units, according to LMC Automotive.	1.330392715
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T unveiled a redesigned Tundra pickup truck on Thursday with a back-up camera, easier-to-use controls and other features designed to take advantage of the expected growth in the lucrative U.S. truck market.Toyota last overhauled the Tundra in 2007 in an effort to crack a market for full-work trucks dominated by General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Chrysler Group LLC FIA.MI. At the time, Toyota executives referred to the Tundra as their most important product launch ever.But the 2007 Tundra launch coincided with a slowdown in U.S. home construction that hurt truck sales that year and forced the Japanese automaker to pile on incentives to win over buyers.This time, however, truck sales are on pace to outstrip the gains seen by the overall U.S. auto industry. Analysts expect the trend to persist this year as the housing market improves and automakers launch an array of new models.“Last time around their timing was off,�� TrueCar.com analyst Jesse Toprak said, referring to Toyota. “This time, their timing is pretty good in terms of the housing market correlation.”The 2014 Tundra, on display at the Chicago Auto Show, which opens for media previews on Thursday, faces stiff competition. Chrysler launched a redesigned Ram 1500 last fall, while GM will introduce redesigned versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra this spring.Next year, Ford will have an overhauled F-150 truck, while Nissan Motor Co's 7201.T U.S. arm will launch a redesigned Titan pickup truck.Toyota also must appeal to today’s consumers, who are less likely to be so-called lifestyle buyers, or those who are enamored of the truck’s image but do not really need it for work, Toprak said.Today’s buyers are more concerned about the truck’s capability and power than with a plush interior and visual style.“It doesn’t matter in terms of the styling of the truck - most truck buyers don’t care about that stuff anyway,�� Toprak said. “What matters is the value proposition. That’s what Tundra’s lacked so far.”The Tundra accounted for 6 percent of the full-size U.S. truck market last year, while the F-Series made up 38.5 percent, auto research firm Edmunds.com said.The Chevrolet Silverado held 25 percent U.S. market share in 2012. Ram was 17 percent last year, while the GMC Sierra was 9.4 percent, according to the Edmunds.com data.The 2014 Tundra is expected to arrive in dealerships in September. As with the 2007 model, Toyota drew heavily on focus groups in its latest overhaul.“Tundra’s new exterior design and all-new interior were inspired by customer feedback requesting a more chiseled exterior and refined interior,�� Bill Fay, head of U.S. sales for the Toyota brand, said in a statement.Toyota now offers Bluetooth wireless technology as a standard feature to make hands-free phone calls on the 2014 Tundra. The audio, heating and cooling controls are 2.6 inches closer to the driver to improve ergonomics in the new truck, Toyota said.The vehicle also features an integrated spoiler in the deck to boost fuel efficiency. The front and rear bumper also come in three parts to help lower replacement costs.	-0.2489229296
TOKYO, March 26 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said it had resumed car production in Thailand on Monday after a near six-month suspension since unprecedented floods inundated its factory in Ayutthaya in early October.The restart is in line with plans projected in late January, when Japan’s No.3 automaker said production in Thailand would be running at full speed from April, when other affected Asian production would also return to normal.Honda had said then that disruptions from the Thai floods would cost it production of 260,000 vehicles globally in the business year ending this month.Honda was hit the worst by the disaster, with the only car factory to be flooded. Rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co normalised production by the end of 2011 as they found alternative sources for parts outside the disrupted supply chain.

TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co on Friday cut its full-year profit outlook by about 10% on expectations of a stronger yen.Japan’s No.3 automaker cut its forecast for operating income to 690 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March, from 770 billion yen previously.Honda now forecasts the yen will average 107 versus the dollar over the period, from a previous assumption of 110 yen.A stronger currency eats into profits because exports become more expensive and the value of overseas earnings decreases.Honda joins compatriots Suzuki Motor Corp, Subaru Corp, Mazda Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Motors Corp in slashing profit projections in recent days.Toyota Motor, the country’s largest automaker, however bucked the trend and retained its forecast on Thursday.Nissan Motor is due to report results on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T expects its global production under the Toyota and Lexus brands to hit 8.7 million vehicles in 2013, nearly the same as the 8.74 million vehicles it expects to have produced in 2012, the Japanese automaker said on Wednesday.Global sales of Toyota and Lexus brands are expected to be at 8.9 million vehicles in 2013, up 2.5 percent from the sales expected this year.Group-wide, Toyota expects to produce 9.94 million vehicles and sell 9.91 million vehicles in 2013. The group-wide forecasts include figures at Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T and Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T.For 2012, Toyota expects its group-wide production to be 9.92 million vehicles globally, up 26 percent from a year ago, as it recovers from a huge earthquake in Japan and Thai floods that took place in 2011.It sees its group-wide global sales for 2012 to be 9.7 million vehicles, up 22 percent.	2.420574887
* Toyota raises 2012/13 net profit outlook 12.8 pct* Toyota’s Japan mfg and export seen profitable for first time in 5 yrs* Toyota more dependent on Japan production, than Nissan, Honda* Top management has no plans to build new plants for next 3 years -execBy Yoko KubotaTOKYO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp lifted its annual profit guidance, banking on stronger sales in its key U.S. market and a boost from a weaker yen, which put its Japanese manufacturing in the black for the first time in five years.But the world’s best-selling automaker, which shipped a record number of cars last year, said it would not build any new factories over the next three years despite the pickup in its fortunes, after it was burned in the financial crisis.Toyota raised its net profit forecast for the year to March by more than 10 percent to 860 billion yen ($9.3 billion) on strong U.S. sales of the Camry sedan and other vehicles.“If the current weak yen trend continues, the company’s profit will likely sharply rise for the next fiscal year as well,�� said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management.“If a recovery in the U.S. economy serves as a tailwind, its stock price has more upside.”The firm said it expected to ship 2.2 million vehicles in the U.S. this calendar year, up almost 6 percent from last year’s figure.Among Japan’s big three automakers Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, analysts see top seller Toyota as the most likely to benefit from a weakening yen because it has the highest ratio of production in Japan, more than half of which it exports.Japanese operations, including domestic manufacturing for export, used to generate about half of Toyota’s profit, but they started losing money after the Lehman Brothers crisis of 2008, until the yen’s recent weakening put them back into the black.The yen is trading around 92 to the dollar, compared with 78 at the start of October. The weaker the Japanese currency, the more money exporters make when they convert overseas profits back into yen.By contrast, Toyota’s South Korean rival Hyundai Motor Co , which including its affiliate Kia Motors Corp is ranked fifth in global sales, last month posted a surprise quarterly profit drop as a stronger won dented its overseas earnings.Last week, Honda announced a third-quarter profit that was less than the market had expected, but believed the weaker yen would help to absorb the impact of poor demand in China and Europe.Nissan is due to announce its results on Feb. 8.In 2013, Toyota expects to sell 8.9 million vehicles globally. Across the group, which includes Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd, it forecasts shipping 9.91 million vehicles.Last year, the 75-year-old firm sold a record 8.72 million vehicles around the world. Its group-wide sales were also a record high of 9.75 million vehicles, beating General Motors Co to regain top rank among car manufacturers.Still, Toyota does not plan to dramatically ramp up production in the weak-yen environment.“It’s easy to confuse volume expansion with true growth as a company,�� Senior Managing Officer Takahiko Ijichi told reporters.“We’re getting rid of that way of doing business,�� he said, adding that the firm did not plan to build new plants for the next three years.Toyota posted net profit of 99.9 billion yen for the three months to Dec. 31, up 23.5 percent from a year ago but below the average estimate of 143.7 billion yen among seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Behind the poorer-than-expected third quarter performance was the cost of settling a class action lawsuit in the United States over claims that millions of Toyota cars accelerate unintentionally.The firm booked 90 billion yen in costs related to the class action settlement, Toyota’s Ijichi said.Shares in Toyota have risen nearly 50 percent since mid-November on hopes the weakening yen will boost its bottom line, nearly double the 28 percent rise in Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei average over the same period.Toyota shares ended down 1.2 percent on Tuesday at 4,540 yen before the earnings announcement, performing better than the Nikkei, which dropped 1.9 percent.	0.8657587549
BEIJING (Reuters) - Executives at Asian automakers with factories in Britain, largely set up to export to the European Union, say they could slow investments in Britain or even put them on ice for now, after the country voted to leave the 28-nation bloc.Automakers, including Toyota 7203.T and Nissan 7201.T, had been among the manufacturers that have warned that a period of uncertainty would follow a Brexit vote, as trade and labor deals with Europe are renegotiated. Most on Friday estimated it could take around two years.Toyota and Nissan had said in the run-up to the vote that continued membership of the European Union was preferable for their operations: a vote to leave would create new challenges for an industry that employs some 800,000 people in Britain.Even so, Sunderland in northern England, where Nissan has its operations, was among the constituencies that surprised pundits by the extent to which voters supported an exit.Shares in all Asian automakers tumbled.“We don’t have any choice but to be more cautious with our investment decisions, including moves like whether to produce a new or significantly redesigned vehicle model in the UK,�� said one official at a global automaker with manufacturing capacity in Britain, speaking on condition of anonymity.Tata Motors' TAMO.NS Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is Britain's largest carmaker, followed by Nissan, which has been in Britain for three decades and makes 475,000 cars a year in the country, most of them for export inside the European Union and beyond. According to sources familiar with the company, JLR has estimated its annual profit could be cut by one billion pounds ($1.47 billion) by the end of the decade as a result of Brexit. It said on Friday it remained committed to Europe.But the carmaker also warned on Friday of a “significant negotiating period�� to follow the vote.“The big question for automakers . . . is what kind of trade deals with the EU would be negotiated. That is the big unknown,�� a second executive at a global automaker said.Exports from Britain to the European Union are free of tariffs and duties. Toyota has said duties under new trading deals could be as much as 10 percent, hitting either prices or margins, and denting sales.Toyota produced about 190,000 cars in Britain last year. Of that, 75 percent went to the European Union. Only 10 percent was shipped and sold within Britain.South Korea’s auto association said it was worried a departure could revive a 10-percent tariff on exports of passenger vehicles to UK, unless a separate deal is negotiated.“This could inevitably undermine the price competitiveness of South Korean automakers in UK, as opposed to Japanese and German rivals which have production bases there,�� said Kim Tae-nyen, vice president at the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA).At least one country saw a silver lining in Brexit. India’s auto industry body, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, said it could presage a better trade deal for India with Britain. India has made several futile attempts to enter into a free trade agreement with the European Union.But others raised the prospect of moving Britain-based manufacturing capacity to Europe.Toyota said in a statement that it would analyse the impact of the vote on its UK operations. Nissan did not comment, though chief executive Carlos Ghosn said last week the company would question its UK position in the event of Brexit.“No one is going to rush out and do anything tomorrow, but rather than revamp a plant in the UK to produce a new model, they might revamp a plant somewhere else,�� CLSA analyst Chris Richter said. “Down the line, it could lead to job losses.”Aside from Toyota, Tata and Nissan, others manufacturing in Britain include BMW BMWG.DE, GM GM.N and Honda 7267.T.Honda produces around 140,000 vehicles per year, including the CR-V crossover SUV and Civic sedan at its plant in Swindon. Half of its production is exported to the EU.For now, officials said efforts would turn to lobbying hard for better trade deals.“Obviously, trading deals to be worked out subsequently could be a worse situation than we have now, or better, or all the same,�� said the second executive. “We don’t know, and that’s the problem.��	5.502116199
FRANKFURT, May 3 (Reuters) - BMW is in talks with South Korean automaker Hyundai to help shoulder the 1-2 billion euros ($1.3-2.6 billion) in costs for developing new engine families, German industry newsletter Automobil Produktion reported on Thursday.Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-koo’s son and heir apparent, Chung Eui-sun, had met a small group of top BMW managers in Munich, Automobil Produktion said, without citing sources.A spokesman declined to comment on the report.However, Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer earlier dampened speculation BMW would extend its partnerships beyond Peugeot , Toyota, Daimler and possibly GM , should ongoing talks with the U.S. automaker prove fruitful.“Further co-operation partners are currently not foreseen,�� Reithofer told reporters on Thursday.BMW had said in March it was working on a new engine architecture that would improve economies of scale for its three, four and six-cylinder petrol and diesel engines.	-5.099834669

15. Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen aus der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus:VIRGIN ATLANTIC - London: Die Pläne der britischen Regierung, im Land ankommende Reisende mit einer Quarantäne von 14 Tagen zu belegen, erschweren die Lage bei der Airline weiter. Sollte das Vorhaben umgesetzt werden, halte dies Fluggäste fern und Virgin werde frühestens im August den Flugbetrieb wieder aufnehmen, sagte ein Insider aus dem Umfeld des Unternehmens. Ohne Quarantäne könne vielleicht schon im Juli wieder geflogen werden. Der britische Virgin-Besitzer Richard Branson hat - wie viele andere Fluggesellschaften auch - Staatshilfe beantragt, um die Coronakrise mit ihren Reisebeschränkungen zu überstehen.FIAT CHRYSLER - Mailand: Der Autobauer bemüht sich angesichts der Coronakrise einem Insider zufolge um eine milliardenschwere Staatsbürgschaft. Das Unternehmen spreche mit der italienischen Großbank Intesa Sanpaolo über einen vom Staat garantierten Kredit im Volumen von 6,3 Milliarden Euro, sagte eine mit dem Vorgang vertraute Person Reuters. Fiat Chrysler und die Bank lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab.VF CORP - Bangalore: Der US-Hersteller von Vans-Schuhen und Timberland-Stiefeln rechnet wegen der durch das Coronavirus verursachten Ladenschließungen im laufenden Quartal mit Umsatzeinbußen von mehr als der Hälfte. “In den ersten zehn Monaten des Fiskaljahres 2019/2020 hat unser Unternehmen Ergebnisse erzielt, die über unseren langfristigen Wachstumszielen liegen. Dann veränderte sich die Welt für uns alle wegen COVID-19��, sagte VF-Corp-Chef Steve Rendle. Davon seien auch die Lieferanten betroffen, ferner würden viele Werke mit reduzierter Kapazität arbeiten. Für das im März beendete vierte Quartal des Geschäftsjahres 2019/20 meldete das in Denver, Colorado, ansässige Unternehmen einen Nettoverlust von 483,8 Millionen Dollar, verglichen mit einem Gewinn von 128,8 Millionen Dollar im Vorjahreszeitraum. Der Nettoumsatz sank um etwa zwei Prozent auf 2,1 Milliarden Dollar und lag damit unter den Analysten-Schätzung von 2,28 Milliarden Dollar. VF-Corp gab keinen Ausblick auf das aktuelle Geschäftsjahr 2020/2021.TOYOTA - Tokio: Der japanische Autobauer plant wegen der Coronavirus-Krise seine heimische Produktion im Juni zu reduzieren. Wegen der geringeren Nachfrage nach Neuwagen werde der Konzern nun 122.000 Einheiten weniger herstellen, teilte Toyota mit. Dies entspreche einer 40-prozentigen Kürzung gegenüber den bisherigen Prognosen für den Monat Juni.BMW - München: Der Autobauer beginnt mit der angekündigten Herstellung von Atemschutzmasken in Deutschland. Zwei vollautomatische Anlagen produzieren im Werk Wackersdorf bei Regensburg täglich insgesamt bis zu 200.000 Mund-Nase-Masken, mit denen sich BMW-Mitarbeiter vor dem Coronavirus schützen sollen. Spezialmaschinen und Rohmaterial stammen ebenfalls aus Bayern. Die Maschinen lieferte der zum chinesischen Autozulieferer Ningbo Joyson Electronic gehörende deutsche Hersteller PIA Automation. Vliesstoffe kommen vom bayerischen Textilkonzern Sandler. Die Bundesregierung will die heimische Produktion von Masken und weiterer medizinischer Ausrüstung ankurbeln.OTTOBOCK �� Danzig: Das Medizintechnikunternehmen hat im vergangenen Jahr erstmals einen Jahresumsatz von mehr als einer Milliarde Euro erzielt. Der Umsatz kletterte 2019 um 8,2 Prozent auf 1,003 Milliarden Euro, wie Ottobock mitteilte. Der bereinigte operative Gewinn (Ebitda) stieg um zehn Prozent auf 191 Millionen Euro. Damit verbesserte sich die Ebitda-Marge auf 19,2 Prozent. “Im nächsten Schritt wollen wir ein Niveau von 20 Prozent erreichen��, sagte Finanzchef Jörg Wahlers. Für 2020 habe Ottobock das Wachstumstempo eigentlich steigern wollen, doch die Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise auf die Geschäftszahlen seien noch nicht abschätzbar, sagte Firmenchef Philipp Schulte-Noelle. “In den ersten Monaten waren wir voll auf Kurs, diese Ziele zu erreichen.�� Sobald sich die Situation normalisiert habe, rechne das Unternehmen mit Nachholeffekten.FOXCONN - Taipeh: Der Gewinn des taiwanischen Elektronikherstellers ist im ersten Quartal um fast 90 Prozent eingebrochen. Der Nettogewinn von Foxconn - früher Hon Hai Precision - rutschte auf 2,1 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar (rund 65 Millionen Euro), da die Corona-Pandemie die Nachfrage von Apple und anderen Großkunden drückte, wie Foxconn mitteilte. Dies liegt deutlich unter den Analystenschätzungen von 8,88 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar. Der Konzern erwartet jedoch ein zweistelliges Umsatzwachstum im zweiten Quartal, da die Produktion in China wieder hochgefahren ist. “Hon Hai wird sich im zweiten Quartal stabilisieren��, erklärte der Konzern.FORTUM/UNIPER - Helsinki: Der finnische Energieversorger Fortum hat im ersten Quartal weniger verdient. Der operative Gewinn schrumpfte um vier Prozent auf 393 Millionen Euro, lag damit aber noch über den Erwartungen der Analysten. Der Mehrheitseigentümer des Düsseldorfer Versorgers Uniper konnte Einbußen durch niedrigere Strompreise weitgehend durch Absicherungsgeschäfte ausgleichen. Fortum bekräftigte, im Laufe des Jahres mit Uniper eine gemeinsame Strategie zu entwickeln.WÜSTENROT &amp; WÜRTTEMBERGISCHE (W&amp;W) - München: Der Gewinn des Bauspar- und Versicherungskonzerns ist wegen des Abschwungs an den Kapitalmärkten in der Coronakrise im ersten Quartal um zwei Drittel eingebrochen. Das Nettoergebnis sei auf 25,0 (78,5) Millionen Euro gesunken, teilte W&amp;W mit. Grund dafür war ein negatives Finanzergebnis. Die Pandemie zeigte sich vor allem bei der Bausparkasse Wüstenrot, deren Brutto-Neugeschäft um 13 Prozent einbrach. Damit habe sie aber noch Marktanteile gewonnen, erklärte W&amp;W. Die Gewinnprognose für 2020 hatte der Konzern bereits Anfang Mai gekappt.CATHAY PACIFIC - Sydney: Die Fluggesellschaft bezeichnet ihre Aussichten wegen der Coronavirus-Pandemie als “sehr düster��. Die Passagierzahlen von Cathay Pacific brachen im April um 99,6 Prozent ein. “Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt sehen wir noch keine unmittelbaren Anzeichen für eine Verbesserung��, sagte Ronald Lam, Manager bei Cathay Pacific. Das Hongkonger Unternehmen verbuchte im Zeitraum Januar bis April einen ungeprüften Verlust von 4,5 Milliarden Hongkong-Dollar (537,1 Millionen Euro).GEA - Düsseldorf: Der für die Nahrungsmittel- und Getränkeindustrie produzierende Anlagenbauer hat bislang keine größeren Auswirkungen der Coronakrise zu spüren bekommen. So stieg der Auftragseingang um 16 Prozent auf 1,38 Milliarden Euro und markierte damit eine Bestmarke für ein erstes Quartal. Bei einem Umsatzplus um 3,5 Prozent auf 1,09 Milliarden Euro stieg das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) vor Restrukturierungsaufwand um 40,7 Prozent auf 105 Millionen Euro. “Gea ist sehr gut in das Geschäftsjahr 2020 gestartet. Auch wenn die Dauer und damit die finanziellen Auswirkungen von Covid-19 nur schwer abzuschätzen sind, halten wir an unserem Ausblick für 2020 fest��, betonte Vorstandschef Stefan Klebert.AURUBIS - Düsseldorf: Der Kupferkonzern ist dank gestiegener Preise im ersten Halbjahr des Bilanzjahres 2019/20 trotz der Coronakrise noch glimpflich davon gekommen. Bei einem Umsatzanstieg auf 6,013 (Vorjahr: 5,7) Milliarden Euro schrumpfte das Vorsteuerergebnis auf 91 (103) Millionen Euro. “Angesichts der Covid-19-Pandemie haben wir Aurubis bisher gut durch die Krise gesteuert��, erklärte Vorstandschef Roland Harings. Er bekräftigte daher seine Jahresziele.VARTA - Düsseldorf: Wegen der hohen Nachfrage nach Lithium-Ionen-Zellen und dank eines Zukaufs ist der schwäbische Batteriehersteller mit deutlichen Zuwächsen ins Jahr gestartet. Der Umsatz schnellte um rund 170 Prozent auf 198,5 Millionen Euro, ohne Akquisitionen hätte der Zuwachs bei 68,2 Prozent gelegen. Das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) stieg in den ersten drei Monaten um 197 Prozent auf 51,7 Millionen Euro, bereinigt um 135 Prozent. Der Vorstand bekräftigte seine Prognose für 2020, die einen Umsatz zwischen 780 und 800 Millionen Euro vorsieht, ein Wachstum zwischen 115 und 120 Prozent.OFFICE DEPOT - Bangalore: Der US-Büroartikelhersteller kündigt die Streichung von rund 13.100 Arbeitsplätzen und die Schließung von Filialen an. Die Maßnahmen sollen bis Ende 2023 umgesetzt werden und zu Nettoeinsparungen von 860 Millionen Dollar führen, wie das Management bekanntgab. Zugleich werden durch den Abbau Belastungen von bis zu 543 Millionen Dollar erwartet. Office Depot will sich künftig stärker auf sein Geschäft mit IT-Dienstleistungen konzentrieren.OMV - Wien: Beim Wiener Erdöl- und Gaskonzern werden die Reiseausgaben von Vorstandschef Rainer Seele und die Sponsoring-Aktivitäten des Unternehmens unter die Lupe genommen. Eine entsprechende Prüfung ordnete der Aufsichtsrat an, wie dessen Vorsitzender Wolfgang Berndt mitteilte. Hintergrund ist ein Bericht der Onlineplattform dossier.at. Diesem zufolge zahlte OMV für Seeles Nutzung von Privatflugzeugen seit 2016 insgesamt 400.000 Euro. Die Sponsorenvereinbarung mit dem Fußballclub Zenit St. Petersburg, dem angeblichen Lieblingsteam des russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin, habe 25 Millionen Euro gekostet. Aufsichtsratschef Berndt sagte der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters, Seeles und seine eigenen Reiseausgaben von 2017 bis 2019 würden untersucht. Das gelte auch für alle Sponsoringausgaben.NIKE - Bangalore: Der US-Sportartikelhersteller erwartet eine Belastung der Finanzergebnisse im laufenden Geschäftsquartal durch die coronabedingten Filialschließungen rund um den Globus. Das teilte der Adidas- und Puma-Konkurrent am Donnerstag nach US-Börsenschluss mit. Nike fährt zwar sein E-Commerce-Geschäft hoch, um die gestiegenen Internetbestellungen stemmen zu können. Aber je nach Land sind nach Angaben des Managements derzeit nur fünf bis 40 Prozent der Nike-Filialen offen. In mehr als 15 Ländern hat das Unternehmen nach den Schließungen im Zuge der Viruskrise wieder Geschäfte geöffnet, darunter Deutschland, Frankreich, Brasilien und die USA.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will cut subsidies on new energy vehicles (NEV) such as electric cars by 10% this year, the finance ministry said on Thursday, following a decision last month to continue providing incentives to buy cleaner cars.The government had announced plans in 2015 to end the subsidies this year, but said in March it would extend them.China has set a target for NEVs, which also include plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, to account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025, compared with the current 5%, as it seeks to cut pollution and cultivate home-grown auto sector champions.Under the new plan, China will extend subsidies for buying NEVs to 2022, and tax exemptions on purchases for two years.However, the subsidies will apply only to passenger cars costing less than 300,000 yuan ($42,376). That is likely to exclude premium electric vehicles such as those built by Germany’s BMW and Daimler.Tesla Inc’s China-made Model 3 sedans, meanwhile, are currently priced at 323,800 yuan before subsidies, meaning the U.S. electric car pioneer will have to reduce the price to qualify for the scheme.China will in principle cut subsidies by 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022, the finance ministry added.But it will not reduce subsidies on commercial NEVs for public purposes this year.China is the world’s biggest car market, where more than 25 million vehicles, including 1.2 million NEVs, were sold last year.The government will raise the requirements for the driving range and power efficiency of cars that qualify for the subsidies, the statement said.It also said the authorities would support the sale of cars with swappable batteries, a technology that has been pursued by Chinese electric vehicle makers Nio Inc and BAIC BluePark.In addition, when the authorities buy vehicles for government use, they will prioritise buying NEVs, it added.The new policy is effective from April 23.“This extending of subsidies will give the industry long term support but is unlikely to impact short term sales much,�� said Cui Dongshu, secretary general at China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).Global automakers including Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, General Motors and Toyota are ramping up electric vehicle production in China to meet stricter government regulations.Sales of NEVs contracted for a ninth month in a row in March and were down over 50% from a year earlier, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), as demand for vehicles plunged due to the coronavirus crisis.	1.264686684
TOKYO (Reuters) - When Toyota Motor looked to the future at the turn of the millennium and aimed its new, edgy Scion small-car brand at twenty-somethings, it could not have guessed that the model would be dead after just 12 years.In killing off the brand last week, the Japanese company was responding to the changing habits of millennials - those born in the 1980s, 90s and 2000s - who are reshaping the traditional model of car ownership.“Surveys we do tell us young buyers are less interested in owning cars,�� one of those behind the Scion brand told Reuters.“They either don’t have the financial leeway or they’re substituting car ownership with ride-sharing or car-hailing services like Uber [UBER.UL],�� he said, adding Toyota would redirect its Scion resources to its Toyota and Lexus models.Toyota launched the Scion brand hoping Generation Y-ers would become the grown-up Toyota buyers of tomorrow. It worked, for a while, with the brand selling 173,000 cars in 2006, but sales dropped to just 56,167 last year, prompting the world’s biggest car maker to call time. Some Scions will be re-badged as Toyotas.“I don’t think my generation hates cars, but the way we look at cars is different now,�� said Brandon Perez, an 18-year-old construction management major at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo.“For my parents�� generation ... buying a car was a big goal. Cars are still important and kids in my age group still want to drive, but we’re not as auto-centric.”Perez also feels young people today are practical and don’t mind buying used cars. “Cars are so reliable now, and more durable,�� he said.He thought Scion failed to live up to its billing as an aspirational brand. “They were kind of like re-styled Toyotas. They look different, but otherwise the Scion tC, for example, isn’t that different from driving a Corolla.”Faced with the demographics of a ��sharing economy�� and a generation that is - very broadly - still living at home with their parents, juggling debts and marrying later, the auto industry is having to shift gear to respond. Also, technology companies such as Apple, Alphabet and Uber are muscling in to control cars of the future.In the biggest Detroit-Silicon Valley crossover deal to date, General Motors is investing $500 million in Lyft, a privately-owned ride-hailing service in the United States, and plans to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars.Others are responding, too, to the disruptive waves from technology and tech-savvy millennials, who increasingly want their cars to be as connected as their homes - though Paula Poveda, a 19-year-old student in Tallahassee, Florida, thinks today’s connectivity acts against the need to own a car.“We’re more connected than my parents�� generation and technology allows us to be in contact with friends constantly. We don’t have to go out and see them all the time,�� she said, adding she doesn’t need to own a car, and when she does she’ll probably buy a used model or get a hand-me-down from her parents.At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Toyota and Ford said they will adopt the same SmartDeviceLink (SDL) software to link smartphone apps to car dashboard screens, and invited other automakers to join them. Toyota is also exploring its own ride-sharing business model, designing smaller, easier to maneuver i-Road vehicles, which could be used specifically for city car-sharing services.The marketing chief of one Asian automaker said the changes prompted by ride-hailing and car-sharing services were a major factor in his firm’s recent move to overhaul its premium brand strategy. As these apps and services gain traction, more households are likely to limit themselves to just one car, said the executive, who didn’t want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.“Day to day, for short commuting and doing errands, they can use Uber or similar services. Those households would more likely buy just one car and spend more money on that car. That would most likely be an upscale car. That’s where our growth is going to come from,�� he said.“A lot of my generation aren’t so good at saving money,�� said Daniel Scarpato, a 25-year-old e-commerce worker who recently moved to Beijing from California.“The job market for us isn’t great, and most young people I know are in debt. Buying a new car is a bit of a luxury.��	2.332115763
Sept 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co Ltd will cut production in China as rising anti-Japan sentiment in the country hurt sales, the Nikkei said.Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated sharply this month after Japan bought an uninhabited group of islands in the East China Sea from their private owner, sparking protests across China and disrupting production at several Japanese-owned plants.Toyota will shut its mainstay Chinese plant in Guangdong province, scheduled to close for eight days from Sunday for national holidays, for an additional four days from Wednesday, the Nikkei said.The facility, which can manufacture 30,000 vehicles a month when running two shifts, will operate only the day shift when it resumes production on Oct. 8, the business daily said.Nissan will suspend production at three plants from Thursday, three days earlier than scheduled, the paper said.The shutdowns are expected to reduce the companies�� combined output by more than 20,000 units in September, the business daily said.	-1.665183679
TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. auto market will continue to mildly recover, likely totalling 16 million vehicles this year, a Toyota Motor Corp executive said on Tuesday.“In the United States, we basically think the market will continue on a recovery track,�� Managing Officer Takuo Sasaki told a news conference to brief on Toyota’s third-quarter earnings.Sales of new light vehicles in the world’s biggest market totalled 15.58 million in 2013.	1.920170682
* GM seeking smaller stake after Isuzu pushed back -source* Isuzu’s strength in Southeast Asia, diesel tech attractive* GM once owned as much as 49 pct of Isuzu* Nikkei newspaper reports GM seeking stake of about 10 pctBy Kentaro SugiyamaTOKYO, May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co first proposed taking a controlling stake of more than one-third in Isuzu Motors Ltd - an investment worth some $3 billion - but is now seeking a smaller holding after the Japanese truck maker said it wanted to remain independent, a person with direct knowledge of the talks said.GM is seen as eager to tap Isuzu’s strength in Southeast Asian markets and its diesel technology, and a deal would in many ways be a foray back to well travelled ground as the two companies were once equity partners for 35 years.The U.S. automaker at one point owned as much as 49 percent in Isuzu before selling the holding down, disappointed with red ink spilled by Isuzu at the time and later strapped for cash of its own. Its last remaining 7.9 percent stake was sold in 2006 for $300 million.Since emerging from its government-funded bankruptcy restructuring in 2009, GM has begun to forge some new alliances in efforts spearheaded by GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky.In March, GM agreed to pay $423 million for a 7 percent stake in French automaker Peugeot SA. Last August, Girsky negotiated a tie-up with Korean conglomerate LG Corp to develop electric cars together.The current talks are, however, still very much preliminary, said the person who declined to be identified because the discussions are private.The re-emergence of GM as a strategic partner would help Isuzu share the burden of developing hybrid and other technologies as environmental regulations around the world tighten. The two firms also still cooperate in sales in Latin America and South Africa.A stake of 33.4 percent in Japan gives the shareholder veto powers over boardroom decisions and would be worth about $3.2 billion at Isuzu’s current share price. The Nikkei business daily has said that GM is seeking a holding of about 10 percent.Isuzu said in a statement on Tuesday it was considering a wide range of partnerships, including but not limited to GM, adding that it had made no decision yet.GM declined to comment. “While we do not comment on rumour and speculation, we routinely speak with other (automakers) on a range of issues,�� spokesman Klaus-Peter Martin said.Toyota Motor Corp currently owns 5.9 percent of Isuzu in addition to a majority stake in rival truck maker Hino Motors Ltd and it remains unclear how Toyota will respond to GM’s overtures to Isuzu.Toyota bought its stake in Isuzu with a view to jointly develop small diesel engines - a forte of Isuzu’s - but that project was shelved after the global financial crisis. Toyota recently signed a deal to use BMW AG’s diesel engines in Europe.GM last year reclaimed its title as the world’s top-selling automaker from Toyota thanks to rapid growth in China, but it is a minor player in fast-growing Southeast Asian markets, where Toyota and other Japanese brands dominate.Isuzu had been discussing a possible tie-up with Volkswagen AG with little progress.Japan’s other truck makers are all aligned with strategic partners: UD Trucks, formerly called Nissan Diesel, belongs to Sweden’s Volvo AB and Mitsubishi Fuso belongs to Daimler AG.Isuzu’s top shareholders are trading houses Mitsubishi Corp and Itochu Corp, with 9.2 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, followed by Toyota.Shares in Isuzu were trading up 1 percent on Wednesday morning in Tokyo, in line with the transport sector index .	-6.31183469
PRAGUE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor ran its Czech plant at full capacity in 2013, producing 303,460 cars, marginally up from 303,035 in 2012, the local operation said on Tuesday.Car makers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, both export-driven countries highly dependent on the car sector, have reported mixed numbers for 2013, despite weakness in European markets.Hyundai makes the ix20, i30 and ix35 models in the Czech Republic.Skoda Auto, the biggest car maker in the Czech Republic, reported a 2 percent dip in global sales to 920,800 last year, most of them made at its domestic plants.The third Czech producer TPCA, a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corp and PSA Peugeot Citroen, reported a 13.9 percent decline in 2013 output, to 185,127 cars.Hyundai plans to keep its facility at full steam in the coming years, shifting some exports to markets outside Europe to compensate for weaker demand on the continent.Czech car production should rebound in 2014 as the European market slowly recovers, after dropping about 4 percent this year, the head of the Automotive Industry Association said last month.	-3.599229932
LE MANS, France (Reuters) - The sun rose over Le Mans on Sunday with Toyota heading for a third successive 24 Hours title with the number eight car shared by Japan’s Kazuki Nakajima, New Zealander Brendon Hartley and Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi.Hopes of a one-two finish receded in the early hours when the team’s number seven car lost half an hour in the garage with a turbo problem just after the halfway mark.That was a blow for World Endurance Championship (WEC) leaders Kamui Kobayashi of Japan, Britain’s Mike Conway and Argentine Jose Maria Lopez, who had started on pole position seeking their first Le Mans win.The trio have been runners up for the past two years.Nakajima and Buemi won in 2018 and 2019 alongside Spain’s double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso, who is absent this year.The problems dropped the number seven Toyota to fourth overall, with the numbers one and three Rebellion Racing cars running second and third at the 18-hour mark but three and four laps off the pace respectively.Toyota had led one-two into the night.The 88th edition of the race at the Sarthe circuit is being held without spectators for the first time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Last year’s event attracted 250,000 spectators, many of them British motor racing fans, to the circuit in northwest France.Le Mans is the world’s oldest sportscar race, first run in 1923, but Toyota are now the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category in the last year before the new Hypercar era.Only four LMP1 cars remained in the race - the Toyotas and two Rebellion R13 Gibsons - after the ByKolles Racing entry retired on Saturday evening.	1.463191587
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia launched a new mass market car project on Friday, as it looks to boost development and adoption of high technology in a renewed industrial push by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy is spurring industry to embrace technology so as to increase productivity and counter growing external risks from an escalating trade war between the United States and China.The new project, spearheaded by Malaysian firm DreamEDGE, will be developed with technical assistance from Japan’s Daihatsu Motor Corp, said Darell Leiking, Malaysia’s trade and industry minister.“It’s privately funded, with no government funding at all,�� Darell told a news conference. “We will support anything that is Malaysian made...as long as no government money is expended or used.”Daihatsu, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp, owns a stake in Perodua, Malaysia’s second homegrown automaker and its best-selling brand.The domestic car industry has long been a sore point for Malaysians, who saw billions of ringgit in taxpayers�� funds spent to bail out Mahathir’s pet project, Proton, before it was bought by Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd in 2017. [GEELY.UL]Darell said the new marque, which has yet to be named, would offer affordable vehicles loaded with advanced technology.The first model, which is likely to be a C-segment sedan powered by either an advanced internal combustion engine or hybrid system, is expected to hit the road by March 2021, said Khairil Adri Adnan, the chief executive of DreamEDGE.The company is still considering its fundraising options, but expects that it will need “a few hundred million�� ringgit to meet its production goal, said Khairil, the firm’s founder.Domestically produced cars formed a key part of Mahathir’s strategy to turn Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy from an agricultural backwater to an industrialized nation during his first tenure as premier from 1981 to 2003.Mahathir championed the new car project last year, on his return to power following an unprecedented election win by his opposition coalition in May.	3.587304063

TOYOTA, Japan, Jan 14 (Reuters) - When Tokuo Fukuichi was brought back to Toyota Motor Corp to become head of design, he was given a simple directive from President Akio Toyoda: make Toyota cars simple and cool. He took a risk and objected.“I said, look, Mr. President, just cool is not good enough,�� Fukuichi told Reuters. “Toyota had already tried hard to fix ugly parts and make them look better. What Toyota lacks the most is character.”Fukuichi, 61, knows something about character. In the late 1980s, he designed the first generation Previa, also known as the “egg-van�� -- one of the most love-it-or-hate-it Toyota vehicles ever.For Toyoda, who has criticised his company for losing sight of the fun and excitement of the automobile and has tried to shake up its stodgy and engineer-dominated design process, Fukuichi brought the right kind of edginess to the job. In a rare move, he asked Fukuichi to rejoin Toyota in 2011 after he had left for group company Kanto Auto Works.Two years on, Toyota’s designs are starting to show signs of change. From luxury brand Lexus’s pinched-in-the-middle “spindle�� grille to the Auris hatchback’s sharply angled headlights, Toyota is taking steps to distance itself from a legacy of “plain vanilla�� styling.Not everyone is happy. At a shareholders�� meeting in June, the very first issue raised from the floor was a complaint about the new “face�� of Lexus models. But Fukuichi is unfazed.“If we don’t take risks now, there will be no future for us,�� he said.The latest evidence of Toyota’s newfound willingness to take risks with the look of its cars will be on show at Monday’s Detroit auto show when Toyota reveals the Furia concept sedan, expected to give consumers a sense of what is coming when it launches the next version of its top-selling Corolla sedan.Analysts say Toyota, the world’s largest car maker by sales volume, has been driven to change. Toyota is being is squeezed between brands such as BMW and Volkswagen’s Audi, which are seen as leaders in design, and a fast-rising rival in Hyundai that has won praise for the way it has managed to make its mass-market sedans look far more expensive than their sticker prices.“Competitors are on the rise, and they are generally improving in areas such as safety technology and fuel efficiency,�� said Kunihiro Matsumoto, an autos analyst at UBS Securities in Japan.“So Toyota needs to distinguish itself in other ways. There is still room for Toyota to improve its products through design.”Toyota executives know that their cars have traditionally sold on quality rather than looks. Some, like generations of the Camry, have been famed for an inoffensive styling that was aimed straight at the middle-of-the road.“Before, our craftsmanship was focused on cutting out flaws. That led to cars that were not hated by anyone, but also not enthusiastically sought after by anyone,�� said Fukuichi.In an effort to fix that, he has shaken up a tradition of design-by-committee.About 100 panel members used to give scores to designs, which would then be tweaked to reflect their varying opinions and become less edgy. Some 30 executives were involved in making the final decision at the design tower in Toyota headquarters, near Nagoya.Now, designers recommend the model they back most strongly. Comments from panel members are taken into consideration but do not necessarily determine the design, and the number executives with a say has been cut to a third of what it was.“It’s no longer a democratic decision,�� Fukuichi, told Reuters in a recent interview.FORGET ‘KAIZEN’In recent years, Toyota’s South Korean rivals Hyundai and its affiliate Kia have won kudos for styling, helping to transform the consumer image of those brands.Hyundai last year hired former BMW designer Christopher Chapman as chief designer at its U.S. design centre, while Kia promoted Peter Schreyer, a former Volkswagen designer, as the first foreign president.In an effort to catch up, Toyota has paired more aggressive designs with edgy marketing, eyeing younger buyers.Promotional images for the Crown luxury sedan that most buyers will seek in black or white have used a flamingo-pink version of the car, which features a big, lightning bolt-shaped grille, with the tagline “Reborn��.One Japanese newspaper ad has popular comedian and film director Takeshi Kitano staring at the new Crown as if he’s not sure what to make of it.Experts say one of Toyota’s challenges will be building a continuity into its styling so consumers can recognise one of its models from a block away - as they can with Audi or BMW.“There are many European automakers that have inherited design with their own identity. Japanese cars do not have that, and without the badge, it is hard to tell which brand it is,�� said Takao Kijima, a professor at the Tokyo University of Science, Yamaguchi who for years worked in the auto industry.Toyota’s engineering and production has been defined by the philosophy of “kaizen��, or continuous improvement, helping it excel at refining existing technologies. But when it comes to design, Fukuichi says Toyota needs to throw out what has been one of the central organising principles of the company.“By doing kaizen, you might be able to be a fashion model with a good figure, but not an actress -- unforgettable even if she has a less attractive figure and an unusual face,�� he said.Experts generally laud Toyota’s efforts to change, although they caution it will be a tough message for the conservative company to absorb. Some warn that changing the design too aggressively for conservative signature cars -- like the Crown and Lexus models -- could alienate existing fans.“Those cars are wonderful like really well-tailored, sophisticated suits,�� said Kunihisa Ito, a professor at College for Creative Studies in Detroit. “For Toyota to pursue an aggressive character, could mean losing its original beauty.��	7.654958678
TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks dropped to more than seven-week closing lows on Friday in choppy trade as investors locked in gains on the last trading day of the fiscal year, led by selling in futures and bellwether stocks such as exporters.The Nikkei share average fell 0.8 percent to 18,909.26, the lowest close since Feb. 9. The benchmark index declined 1.8 percent for the week and 1.1 percent for the month. For the quarter, it dropped 1.1 percent.Much of the demand for Japanese stocks has been influenced by the yen’s moves and broad sentiment around U.S. President Donald Trump’s early efforts to change domestic policies.Trump’s failure to push through a healthcare bill triggered sharp selling in Japanese equities on Monday as investors fretted about his ability to push through economic stimulus measures.As the dollar-yen levels have been volatile recently, investors will remain cautious for a while, traders say.All sectors but the utility were in negative territory. Exporters lost ground, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 1.1 percent and Honda Motor Co dropping 1.3 percent.The broader Topix shed 1.0 percent to 1,512.60, with 2.2 billion shares changing hands, the biggest since March 10.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers, led by Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, have lost an estimated $250 million in output because of anti-Japan protests in China this week and now face the risk that sales will sputter in the world's largest car market.Chinese protesters took to the streets this week in response to an escalating dispute with Japan over ownership of a group of isles in the East China Sea, prompting Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Nissan to temporarily halt operations at plants in China.Lost production volume from those suspensions amounted to around 14,000 vehicles as of Thursday, according to an estimate by IHS Automotive. That would mean immediate lost revenue of about $250 million, based on an average vehicle sticker price of about $18,000 for the Japanese brands.That toll could rise. Toyota said some of its China plants are still suspended, without specifying. Honda also has two factories halted, while Nissan has resumed operations.Nissan has been the most successful Japanese automaker in China, and is most exposed now. Its projected sales in China account for 27 percent of its global sales volume, compared with 18 percent for Honda and 11 percent for Toyota.Industry executives and analysts said automakers would be able to make up for lost output by running more overtime.“What is more important is how consumers will react from now on,�� said Koichi Sugimoto, a senior analyst at BHP Paribas. “It wouldn’t be strange if some people start thinking that it’s better to buy South Korean cars then Japanese ones so that their cars won’t be destroyed by demonstrators.”Moody’s credit rating agency said it was hard to predict how “rising anti-Japanese sentiment�� would affect business.“The possible implications - in an extreme and unanticipated scenario - could include the loss of access to a significant and growing market ... or a reduction in the ability of Japanese manufacturers to locate facilities in China.”�CAR IS JAPANESE, MIND IS CHINESE”With immediately recognizable logos, Japanese cars became a target of havoc for anti-Japan protesters in China. Protesters burned a Toyota dealership in Qingdao and several more dealerships suffered damage, a company spokesman said.A Honda dealership in Beijing sent out text messages warning customers to be careful. Photos circulated online of Japanese cars carrying banners such as “Car is Japanese, Mind is Chinese�� and “From now on, I will boycott Japanese goods��.Some Japanese companies are coming up with contingency plans in case tension escalates. Brake supplier Akebono Brake Industry 7238.T is preparing contingency plans in case it faces problems in importing materials needed to supply automakers in China, the company's CEO told Reuters on Thursday.Japanese firms lag rivals General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen VOWG.DE in China but remain keen on expansion.Toyota aims to double sales in China to 1.8 million cars by 2015. Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota, said Chinese consumers would recognize the contributions of Japanese automakers and their Chinese partners to the Chinese economy.“I hope the problem will be resolved soon so that Japanese cars will be back on shopping lists,�� he told reporters.For its part, Nissan plans to boost sales in China to 2.3 million vehicles in 2015 and has launched the made-in-China brand name Venucia together with its joint venture partner Dongfeng Motor Group Co 0489.HK.Reflecting market worries about the fallout, Nissan’s Credit Default Swaps have been rising all week and hit a six-week high on Thursday.Sales in China’s auto market grew sharply in 2009 and 2010, but growth fell to 5.2 percent in 2011. Sales are up 4 percent in 2012 so far.The Toyota Camry, Nissan Teana and Honda Accord represent three of the top five selling mid-size cars in China.While the current tension may create an opening for brands like Hyundai 005380.KS, auto market share is unlikely to shift much as long as Beijing moves to contain the protests, said Michael Dunne, a Hong Kong-based auto consultant.“It’s a secret to no one that there is a certain animosity that Chinese people feel to Japan for historical reasons. At the same time, it has not stopped them from buying millions of Japanese cars,�� he said. “As much as they love their flag, they love their money more.��	-3.104294479
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS said on Tuesday it has signed a preliminary deal to build a new factory in Indonesia, which would be its first car plant in Southeast Asia and a crack at Japanese rivals that dominate the market. The deal comes as Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS struggle with a prolonged sales downturn in China, where they suspended two factories this year. Hyundai Motor said it will invest about $1.55 billion in the Indonesia auto manufacturing plant from now until 2030, including product development and operation costs.The facility, to be built in the city of Bekasi, east of Jakarta, will start production in late 2021, with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and a plan to grow that to 250,000 vehicles a year, Hyundai said.Hyundai plans to make small sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), while electric vehicles (EVs) tailored to Southeast Asian market are under consideration.Hyundai said it is building the production facilities to avoid import tariffs ranging from 5% to 80% in the ASEAN region. The plant will cater to Indonesia, the region’s largest automobile market, and other countries belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), it said.The plant will allow the automaker to secure future growth to help it “combat slowing demand in the global automotive market��, Hyundai said in its statement.The deal was signed at an event attended by Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Hyundai Motor Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung. Widodo is in South Korea for a meeting of ASEAN leaders hosted by South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Moon has been pushing a “New Southern Policy�� aiming to deepen ties with Southeast Asia as Seoul seeks to curb its reliance on traditional trading partners like China and the United States.Hyundai is far behind Japanese rivals in Southeast Asia, with its sales reaching 122,883 vehicles versus Toyota’s 854,032 from January to September this year, according to research firm LMC Automotive.LMC Automotive forecast a 4% year-on-year decline in total vehicle sales in the ASEAN region in the fourth quarter, partly because the slowdowns in the Thai and Indonesian economies show no signs of abating.Hyundai said key ASEAN countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore are expected to see combined vehicle sales grow to 4.49 million units in 2026, from 3.16 million in 2017.	-0.2682479175
(Reuters) - A territorial row over a chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea has soured relations between China and Japan and spilled over to business ties between Asia’s two largest economies.Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Suzuki are curtailing production in China in the wake of anti-Japan protests that shut dealerships and darkened sales prospects in the world’s top car market.Airlines from China and Japan have cut or delayed flights between the two countries and Japanese businesses shut hundreds of stores and factories across China during the protests, some sending workers back to Japan.Below is a summary of the economic ties between the world’s number two and three economies.- Japan would log about 12 trillion yen ($154 billion) in annual losses in exports to China if shipments fell to zero for one month, according to the Daiwa Institute of Research.- Daiwa calculates a total of 2.2 trillion yen of factory output would be lost under the same conditions. It also estimates that if Japan’s auto exports stopped for a month, it would mean a loss of 144.5 billion yen.- If anti-Japan demonstrations continued for a month and Japanese sales in China came to a halt for that period, it would reduce total sales by about 1.5 trillion yen, according to an estimate by SMBC Nikko Securities.- China became Japan’s biggest export market in 2009, surpassing the United States. Japan’s shipments to China accounted for nearly a fifth of its total exports in 2011 compared to less than 7.7 percent in 2001, according to Finance Ministry data.- Japan is China’s third-largest trading partner after the European Union and the United States and two way-trade between the two economies rose 11.7 percent in 2011 to a record $345 billion, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.- Japan’s outbound direct investment in China reached 1 trillion yen in 2011, up 60 percent from 2010 and above 726 billion yen recorded in 2005, Finance Ministry data showed.- China’s direct investment in Japan fell sharply to 8.9 billion yen last year from 27.6 billion yen the year before, but remained well above the 2005 level of 1.3 billion yen.- Over 33,400 Japanese companies and affiliates were operating in China and Hong Kong as of October 1, 2011, up 75.4 percent from a year earlier.- According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, there were 22,307 Japanese companies and joint ventures at the end of 2010, accounting for 16 percent of the total number of foreign companies in China and employing about 3 million people.- China profits account for 25 percent of Nissan Motor Co’s net profit, 21 percent at that of Toyota Motor, and 16 percent at Honda Motor, according to an estimate by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.($1 = 78.25 yen)	-1.665183679

July 30 (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for carmakers in central Europe. Below are figures on producers in the region and their contribution to the economies of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the countries in the region that are most reliant on the auto industry.Population: 9.8 million.The car sector’s contribution to GDP is about 4-6%, and it accounted for almost one third of industrial output and 21% of exports in 2019.The sector employs around 170,000 people.GDP FORECAST FOR 2020: the government projects a 5% decline (vs OECD projection for a decline of 8%)** AUDI - production is running in three shifts at its car plant, but certain parts of the engine plant were not back at full capacity as of mid-July. It made 164,372 cars last year and 1.969 million engines but declined to give a forecast for this year’s output due to the unpredictable situation. It plans a one-week maintenance shutdown at the car plant in August. In most parts of engine production, a two-week halt or reduced operation is planned.** DAIMLER - operates in two shifts now, but is due to go back to three shifts from the first week of August. It declined comment on orders or expected output, and made about 190,000 cars last year. It plans a summer shutdown from Aug. 17-23.** SUZUKI - restarted production at the end of April in a single shift, and went back to two shifts on July 13. From this year, it is making only hybrid cars for European Union markets. Last year it made close to 180,000 cars, and it expects output this year to be 20% below plans. It has scheduled a summer maintenance shutdown from Aug. 10-21.** OPEL - its engine factory restarted on May 13, and is now running at full capacity in three shifts.** BMW - the company said in mid-May that construction of its plant in eastern Hungary would be delayed “by a few months.�� BMW announced in 2018 that it would invest 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) to build a plant in Hungary.Population: 10.7 million.The auto sector’s share in GDP is around 10%, and it accounts for more than 20% of exports.Czech car makers produced 1.43 million vehicles in 2019.The auto industry employs around 180,000 people directly and about half a million in total.GDP FORECAST: the government projects a 5.7% decline (vs OECD forecast for a 9.6% decline)** SKODA AUTO - part of the Volkswagen Group and the country’s biggest exporter, it delivered 1.24 million cars in 2019, with most produced in its Czech plants. It has returned to full production although it has said output will depend on demand.** TPCA - a joint venture between Toyota Motor Co and Peugeot, it is running at full strength since June although shutdowns caused lost production of 40,000 vehicles.** HYUNDAI MOTOR MANUFACTURING CZECH - part of Hyundai Motor Co., it produced 309,500 vehicles in 2019. It said in June it aimed to return to three-shift operations in the second half of the year as it saw some improvements.Population: 5.5 million.The auto sector’s share in GDP is around 13%, and it accounts for about half of industrial production.Slovakia is the world’s biggest per capita car producer, with 1.1 million vehicles made in 2019.The sector employs about 275,000 directly and indirectly.GDP FORECAST: the government projects a 9.8% decline (vs OECD forecast of a 9.3% decline)** VOLKSWAGEN SLOVAKIA - the country’s biggest producer manufactured 377,750 vehicles in 2019. It said current production was in line with plans but declined to give a forecast for 2020 output. The Slovak government has aimed to gain further Volkswagen investments at the plant after the German carmaker backed away from a new site in Turkey.** KIA MOTORS SLOVAKIA - running a two-shift operation and aiming to reintroduce a third shift in September, after the planned summer shutdown. It produced a record 344,000 cars in 2019. Output fell 27% year-on-year in the first half of 2020.

KUSATSU, Japan (Reuters) - Hirotoshi Ogura, a��self-described “factory geek��, is Daikin Industries' 6367.T master of doing more with less �� and part of the reason Japan’s recovery remains stuck in the slow lane.As Japan heads into the season of peak demand for room air-conditioners, Ogura and other Daikin managers have been tasked with figuring out how to boost output by some 20 percent at a plant in western Japan that six years ago the company had almost given up on as unprofitable.The wrinkle: they have no budget for new capital investment at the 45-year-old Kusatsu plant. The still-evolving workaround shown to a recent visitor involves home-made robots for ferrying parts, experimental systems using gravity rather than electricity to power parts of the line, more temporary workers on seasonal contracts and dozens of steps to chip away at the 1.63 hours it takes to make a typical new air conditioner.“We can do a lot without spending anything,�� says Ogura, a 33-year Daikin veteran who joined the company just after high school. “Anything we need, we first try to build ourselves.”Like Daikin, a number of Japanese manufacturers are shifting production back to Japan from China and elsewhere to take advantage of a weaker yen. Rival Panasonic 6752.T has pulled back some production of room air-conditioners, Sharp 6753.T has brought back production of some refrigerators, and Canon 7751.T has repatriated some output of high-end copiers, according to a list compiled by Nomura.But even as output recovers, Japanese companies remain cautious about new capital investment in factories and equipment. The trend is especially pronounced for smaller firms down the supply chain.After increasing capital spending by 6 percent in the just-completed fiscal year, small manufacturers plan a 14 percent decrease in the current year, according to the Bank of Japan’s quarterly survey released this week. Big manufacturers like Daikin plan a 5 percent increase, but overall investment remains 10 percent below pre-crisis 2007 levels.Over the same time, corporate earnings have increased by 11 percent, shares have rallied �� Daikin’s are up more than four-fold from its 2008 low - and Japanese companies have socked away a record 87 trillion yen ($730 billion) in cash.For Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic revival plan to work, pulling Japan out of decades of stagnation and deflation, companies need to be willing to use that cash for new investment in a way they have so far baulked at in the more than two years since he took office, economists say.“It turned out that the government and the BOJ were wrong in thinking monetary easing would boost capital spending,�� said Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute. “Low growth expectations appear to outweigh the benefit from lower interest rates, keeping companies from boosting capital spending.”For Daikin, there is a wariness that the slumping demand and sharply higher yen that almost forced the closure of the Kusatsu plant in 2009 could return at any time. Sales in Japan represent just 25 percent of Daikin’s air-conditioning sales now, down from over a third in 2009.But managers also say the lean years have forced the company to innovate at its four home factories, a theme mirrored at Daikin’s production mentor, Toyota Motor 7203.T.At the urging of Toyota president Akio Toyoda, Japan’s top automaker last week unveiled the results of a five-year-old program to re-engineer the way it makes cars to cut the costs of retooling existing factories and building new ones.Already running its factories at 90 percent of capacity, Toyota expects to be able to cut the cost to retool an existing production line for a new model by half of what it cost in 2009 and cut the investment needed for the new plants it is planning for Mexico and China by 40 percent from earlier levels.Like Daikin, the savings at Toyota will come by a thousand cuts, from smaller and more efficient paint booths to a faster and more flexible robot welding system that will also be installed at factories in Japan.Atsushi Takeda, chief economist for the Itochu Economic Research Institute, said there was not much Abe’s government could do to shake companies out of their caution, apart from cutting regulations and encouraging new industries, areas where progress has been slow. Most Japanese companies still see better growth outside Japan and are investing accordingly.“Companies were so hard hit by the excessive yen strength after the Lehman shock they want to be convinced there won’t be a reversal of the weak yen over the next five to 10 years,�� Takeda said. “They are in no mood to take risk.��($1 = 119.6800 yen)	-2.197098976
(Reuters) - Spain’s Dani Sordo led after the first leg of the Rally of Italy in Sardinia for Hyundai on Friday while Citroen’s championship leader Sebastien Ogier hit a rock and retired.Ogier had started as overnight leader but was an early casualty on stage five with the Frenchman unable to repair his car’s smashed front left suspension. He was already some 30 seconds down at the time of impact.Belgian Thierry Neuville, third in the championship for Hyundai, also had a difficult day on the Mediterranean island and finished the leg seventh overall after running into a ditch in the afternoon.Ogier led the championship standings going in to Sardinia, two points clear of Toyota’s Estonian Ott Tanak with Neuville a further eight points adrift.Tanak was best placed of the title contenders, ending the leg in third place and 11.2 seconds off the pace with every chance of taking the lead on Saturday.The day’s seventh stage was canceled after a spectator required medical attention, with a nominal time awarded since the top three had already gone through.Five different drivers led over the course of Friday, including Toyota’s Jari-Matti Latvala who later rolled his car and continued without a windscreen -- even winning a stage -- before retiring in the afternoon.Saturday is the longest leg, with stages to the east of Alghero.	2.786502376
TOKYO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to curb daily vehicle output in Japan by 15 percent in April from a year earlier as it adjusts for a dampening of demand from a national sales tax rise, a source familiar with its production plans said on Tuesday.The tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent is widely expected to spur a pickup in consumer spending before it goes into effect on April 1, followed by a temporary slump when it kicks in.The tax increase, engineered by the previous opposition administration but given final approval by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and urged by IMF officials and global credit ratings agencies, aims to rein in Japan’s huge public debt even at the risk of slowing the economy in the short term.Toyota plans to manufacture around 12,200 vehicles a day in the month of April, down 15 percent from a year ago, the source told Reuters.In January, the world’s biggest carmaker has planned daily production up 4 percent year-on-year while February and March output are planned to rise 3 percent, the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity because the production plans are not made public.Toyota spokesman Naoki Sumino said the company does not disclose its monthly production plans.The Nikkei business daily reported that Toyota planned to make around 12,000 vehicles daily in Japan in April.Toyota announced last week that it would trim full-year production in Japan this year by 6 percent to 3.15 million vehicles.Toyota executives have said that a decline in sales following the tax hike would be inevitable.“Of course we adjust daily run rates,�� said a company official with knowledge of the matter. “I wouldn’t read too much into it.”The company’s president Akio Toyoda said this month that he wanted to limit the duration of the tax hike’s hit to sales to no more than three months.“We want to make it so that from July we can see an upturn in the mood,�� he told reporters.The tax increase, which will help pay for rising healthcare costs, has prompted consumers to bring forward purchases of homes, cars, other durable goods and luxury items before they become more expensive.A Reuters corporate survey in late November and early December found that almost half of the respondents expected the negative impact of the tax hike on consumer spending to have faded within six months.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is giving its Vios and Yaris models a major makeover for China as part of the Japanese group’s make-or-break move into the no-frills entry-level segment of the world’s biggest autos market.Versions of the Vios and Yaris have done relatively well in the United States, Europe and Japan, “but we have not made sufficient progress with the car in China,�� Hiroji Onishi, head of Toyota’s China operations, told reporters during the Shanghai auto show on Sunday.“We tried to give (the models) a proper “daqi�� stance typical of what Chinese consumers look for, and we improved fuel efficiency,�� he said, referring to a local phrase that Chinese use for a car’s road presence.The revamps are a key plank in Toyota’s fightback strategy in a market where its sales were battered last year in the fallout from a row between Beijing and Tokyo over disputed islands in the East China Sea.Onishi said it could take Toyota at least a year to win back business lost to that damaging territorial dispute, leveraging the new no-frills models.The re-designs, with the new sedan version replacing the existing Vios and a hatchback replacing today’s Yaris, are a recognition by Toyota that it misread the Chinese market even before last year’s dispute that halved the company’s sales in September. The Japanese firm will keep the existing model names for the new cars that should be in showrooms by the end of the year.The new cars are critical to Toyota’s China strategy as they are planned as high-volume models to regain momentum in the market and restore branding after the Yaris fizzled - partly through a perceived lack of ‘daqi�� and because it was priced too high.The existing Vios, launched in 2002, cost from 89,500 yuan ($14,500), while the Yaris, brought to market six years later, cost from 87,000 yuan - while annual incomes for many are 50,000-60,000 yuan. Neither car really took off with a new consumer class of people who now just about earn enough to be able to afford a car.A decade ago, Akio Toyoda, the founding-family scion who now heads the group, ran Toyota’s China operations and set the “aspirational�� goal of selling 1 million cars a year in China by 2010. It missed that goal in 2010 and again in 2011. In September last year, days before the diplomatic dispute with China, Toyota said it aimed to sell up to 1.8 million cars annually in China by 2015.The company’s 2012 China sales fell nearly 5 percent to 840,000 cars, and Masaki Taketani, Detroit-based research director at consulting firm IHS Automotive, doesn’t see sales topping 1 million until at least 2015.Much will depend on what Chinese drivers make of the Toyota models�� design, style and price makeover.“This is a live-or-die car for us,�� a senior China-based Toyota executive told Reuters ahead of the Shanghai show.Crucially, General Motors�� Chevrolet Sail, a China entry-level car it launched in 2010, starts at around 56,000 yuan. GM sold 218,000 Sails last year at an average of more than 18,000 a month. Sales of the Yaris averaged around 1,250 a month, while average monthly Vios sales were just 730.Toyota China’s Onishi said the remodeled no-frills cars would use more parts sourced locally in China to keep down the manufacturing cost, but it would be difficult for Toyota to bring down selling prices below 60,000 yuan. Instead, it would aim to compete in the same price range as the Nissan Motor Sunny, which starts in China at 82,800 yuan.“That said, we’re still discussing whether we could come up with a more strategic pricing,�� Onishi added.IHS�� Taketani said The revamp would be a test case for Toyota and other Japanese companies battling in China.“This is a must-win car for Toyota,�� he said, predicting the Japanese group would do well to sell 80,000 of the new cars by 2015, well short of the 200,000 a year he believes Toyota is targeting.($1 = 6.1776 Chinese yuan)	13.908937
JAKARTA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - General Motors Co, the world’s second-biggest car maker, is trying to break the Japanese stranglehold on the popular family car market in Indonesia, where it sees the next auto boom after China, a senior executive said.Despite being in Indonesia for about 30 years longer than Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and its affiliates including Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd, the U.S. company is only a small player in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.The U.S. company sold around 12,000 cars from January to October this year, whereas Toyota, the world’s biggest car maker, sold more than 350,000.General Motors is banking on multi-purpose vehicles, sport utility vehicles and compact cars to close the gap with its Japanese rivals, said Michael Dunne, who became president of the company’s Indonesian operations in September.“The most exciting thing about Indonesia is it reminds me of China about a dozen years ago, early 2000s,�� Dunne, a former car consultant who was also the author of a book on General Motors�� strategy in China, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.“Population times per capita income equals opportunity for automakers. So when you have a massive population and you have that income threshold crossing $3,500, in country after country, without exception, that’s been a trigger of take-off.”Sales in Indonesia by some estimates are expected to double over the next three years.Since April this year, General Motors has been producing the Chevrolet Spin - a van with three rows of seats priced from 144 million rupiah ($12,000) - at its factory in the outskirts of Jakarta.The country of 240 million people has bought more than 1.1 million vehicles so far this year, according to the latest industry data from Gaikindo.Toyota and Daihatsu control more than half of that market and keep a tight grip on the local dealership network through their partnership with Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International.In response, General Motors, which is boosting its network of around 40 dealers in Indonesia, provides basic car maintenance and repairs directly to customers in their homes or offices.The company, with a slightly more than one percent share of the Indonesian market, is open to working with a partner in future, Dunne said.General Motors currently has a tie-up with SAIC Motor Corp in China.“I think as a starting point, get in, get established, build a brand, win customers�� enthusiasm for our brand. (Then) take a look around and say, in this phase two as we look to the future, what makes more sense for us: remain independent, form an alliance?�� Dunne said.“Everything is under consideration, what makes sense for us to grow our business in this market,�� he said.General Motors is also closely watching the development of cheap, fuel-efficient cars in Indonesia. Automakers including Toyota and Honda Motor Co have spent billions of dollars this year on a new line of low-cost, green car (LCGC) models.“It will be really interesting to see what happens with LCGCs,�� Dunne said. “We would like to watch first, let the incumbents lead, see where they take it. They may create a market that we can join.��	0.3905600798

TOKYO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday issued a recall covering all 1.9 million of the third-generation Prius cars sold worldwide, due to a programming glitch in their hybrid system.About half of the recalls are in Japan and 713,000 in North America, a Toyota spokeswoman said. No accidents have been reported related to the defect.Toyota said the problem was in the software used to control the boost converter in a module that is part of the hybrid system.“The setting of the software could cause higher thermal stress in certain transistors within the booster converter, and these transistors could deform or become damaged as a result,�� Toyota said.“This will result in various warning lights being illuminated, and will probably cause the vehicle to enter a failsafe mode,�� it said, noting that the car can be driven but with reduced driving power.In limited cases, the hybrid system could shut down, causing the vehicle to stop, possibly while it is being driven, Toyota said.The latest action would be the third recall for the current, five-year-old Prius, most recently in June last year for problems related to the brake accumulator. The Prius is one of Toyota’s best-selling models, and has become synonymous with the fuel-saving hybrid technology.Toyota, the world’s top-selling automaker, does not disclose cost estimates for recalls.The number of vehicles called back for a single defect has ballooned over the years as car makers increasingly use common parts across multiple models to save development and procurement costs.Since a damaging quality crisis in 2010 that led to the recall of more than 10 million vehicles and marked a turning point in Toyota’s 70-year history, automakers in general have become more proactive in addressing safety concerns.In late 2012, Toyota issued two multi-million-vehicle recalls, including one of more than 7.4 million vehicles to fix power window switches that were a potential fire hazard. That was the industry’s biggest single recall since Ford Motor Co took 8 million vehicles off the road in 1996.Shares in Toyota were up 0.3 percent on Wednesday afternoon, roughly in line with the benchmark Nikkei average.	-7.485539299

TOKYO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers will ramp up production early next year because they expect a big increase in car purchases before a sales tax hike in April, media reported on Sunday.Toyota Motor Corp will increase domestic output in January-March by about 10 percent compared with this month, the Nikkei business daily reported.Toyota has already told its parts suppliers that daily output in January-March will total around 14,000 vehicles, the Nikkei said without citing the source of its information.For December the automaker had planned to produce about 12,500 cars per day, the newspaper said.In January, Honda Motor Co will operate two of its domestic plants two days longer than originally scheduled to meet demand for one of its smaller models, the Nikkei said.Mitsubishi Motors Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp will also keep domestic production lines running three days longer than originally planned in January to meet demand for newly introduced sub-compact models.Japan will raise its 5 percent sales tax to 8 percent in April to help pay for rising healthcare costs. The tax increase has prompted consumers to bring forward purchases of homes, cars, other durable goods and luxury items before they become more expensive.

DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The trade group for U.S. auto parts makers on Thursday asked the government for emergency grants “to keep the doors open,�� tariff relief and other assistance to cope with mounting pressures from the coronavirus crisis.The Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) asked congressional leaders to create a “Manufacturing Emergency Assistance�� grant program “to keep the doors open, preserve jobs, and prevent bankruptcies in the vital manufacturing sector.”The grants could offset the costs of medical testing, the group said. The group also called for subsidies to relocate operations to the United States.Relief from the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese products and imported steel rank first among the list of requests MEMA made in a letter to top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, who are considering different packages of aid that could affect a broad swath of the U.S. economy.On Wednesday, President Donald Trump rejected the idea of extending tariff relief.Auto suppliers are getting hit as automakers suspend production in North America and Europe to contain the spread of COVID-19.Estimates for how deeply U.S. and global vehicle sales could drop vary widely. Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Thursday they were evaluating the impact of as much as a 90% drop in U.S. sales over three months. Sales in China fell by more than 90% in February compared to a year ago as the coronavirus crisis intensified.Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday drew down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and said it was suspending its dividend.On Thursday, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said it would halt production at its assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, until March 29, following similar moves by the Detroit Three automakers, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and other manufacturers.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T also announced Thursday would extend a planned two-day shutdown next week through April 3.Automakers are not currently seeking any immediate assistance as part of a $1 trillion government stimulus and rescue package expected to soon move through Congress but instead calling for “broad economic measures to keep the economy on track.��	4.507985574
(Repeats from earlier Feb. 4)* Nissan shifts focus from EVs to hybrids* Toyota considers hydrogen fuel cells* EV demand falls far short of expectationsBy Norihiko Shirouzu and Yoko Kubota and Paul LienertTOKYO/DETROIT, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Are electric cars running out of juice again?Recent moves by Japan’s two largest automakers suggest that the electric car, after more than 100 years of development and several brief revivals, still is not ready for prime time - and may never be.In the meantime, the attention of automotive executives in Asia, Europe and North America is beginning to swing toward an unusual but promising new alternate power source: hydrogen.The reality is that consumers continue to show little interest in electric vehicles, or EVs, which dominated U.S. streets in the first decade of the 20th century before being displaced by gasoline-powered cars.Despite the promise of “green�� transportation - and despite billions of dollars in investment, most recently by Nissan Motor Co - EVs continue to be plagued by many of the problems that eventually scuttled electrics in the 1910s and more recently in the 1990s. Those include high cost, short driving range and lack of charging stations.The public’s lack of appetite for battery-powered cars persuaded the Obama administration last week to back away from its aggressive goal to put 1 million electric cars on U.S. roads by 2015.The tepid response to EVs also pushed Nissan’s high-profile chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, perhaps the industry’s most outspoken proponent of battery cars, to announce in December a major strategic shift toward more mainstream gasoline-electric hybrids, which overcome many of the shortcomings of pure EVs.The move was widely seen as a tacit acknowledgement by Ghosn that his all-or-nothing, multibillion-dollar bet on EVs is falling far short of his ambition to sell hundreds of thousands of battery-powered Nissan Leafs.Instead, Nissan plans to follow rival Toyota Motor Co , the world’s largest purveyor of hybrids, which now is poised to leapfrog pure EVs altogether to pursue what might be the next big green-tech breakthrough: pollution- and petroleum-free fuel-cell cars that convert hydrogen to electricity.Vice Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, the “father of the Prius�� who helped put hybrids on the map, said he believes fuel-cell vehicles hold far more promise than battery electric cars.“Because of its shortcomings - driving range, cost and recharging time - the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars,�� Uchiyamada said. “We need something entirely new.”In the race to identify the Next Big Thing in automotive technology, the stakes are enormous.For example, Nissan, with French partner Renault, has committed $5 billion for development and manufacture of EVs and batteries - a risky bet that could take years to pay off - while Toyota has spent an estimated $10 billion or more over the past 16 years to develop, build and market an ever-expanding range of hybrids, led by the popular and now profitable Prius.While neither Nissan nor Toyota is likely to pull the plug on electric cars, it is clear from their recent moves that both companies are looking beyond EVs to meet future transportation needs.Both automakers began advanced green-car engineering programs in the mid-1990s, with Toyota introducing the first-generation Prius hybrid and Nissan unveiling the battery-powered Altra in late 1997.Toyota brought the Prius to the United States in 2000, but it took Nissan another 10 years to follow the low-volume Altra and other modest electric-car projects such as the Hypermini with the handsomely funded 2010 launch of the Leaf.With Uchiyamada overseeing continuous refinement of the Prius, Toyota took a 10-year lead in the green-car derby. Along the way, though, Toyota effectively subsidized billions of dollars in development, manufacturing and marketing costs through the first two generations of the Prius, according to former Toyota executives.While it took the Toyota hybrid six years to catch fire with U.S. consumers, the latest sales data points to the widening chasm between the two companies�� radically different approaches to electrification.In the past year, Toyota has broadened its hybrid portfolio to 12 models, including four versions of the Prius, now in its third generation. Toyota in 2012 sold 327,413 hybrids in the United States and 1.2 million globally. Worldwide sales of its hybrids now approach 5 million.The Prius accounts for more than half of those sales, making it the most successful green car in history and one of the few exceptions to the public’s yawning indifference to green vehicles and technology.The Leaf, on the other hand, has been the rule rather than the exception.Nissan unveiled the Leaf two years ago and to date has sold just under 50,000 worldwide. It sold 9,819 last year in the United States, well under its target of 20,000.As part of a year-end sales push, Nissan slapped incentives of almost $6,000 on the Leaf, and in January slashed the starting price by more than $6,000, to $29,650. Some Nissan dealers in Los Angeles are advertising Leaf lease rates as low as $199 a month with $1,999 down, according to industry research firm TrueCar.“When new technologies are launched, sales do not grow as quickly as everyone expects,�� said Mitsuhiko Yamashita, Nissan executive vice president and head of research and development. But “with EV technologies continuously improving and with prices falling, there is a possibility that sales could explode.”That is not likely to happen anytime soon.Nissan may be mildly encouraged that the Leaf is the best-selling pure EV in the United States. But total EV sales last year were only 14,687, representing 0.1 percent of total U.S. sales of 14.5 million. In comparison, hybrid sales in 2012 climbed to 473,083, or roughly 3.3 percent of the market. And of every three hybrids sold last year in the United States, two were a Toyota or a Lexus.Fueled by government subsidies and tax incentives, hybrid sales in Japan have rocketed to 40 percent of the industry total, with the Prius a top seller. Hybrids, however, have been far less popular with consumers in such major markets as Europe and China.“WE ARE PRAGMATIC PEOPLE”The outlook for pure electric vehicles is even more cloudy.At the moment, Ghosn’s heady 2009 prediction that electric vehicles would capture 10 percent of the global market by 2020 - 6 million battery-powered cars a year or more - doesn’t seem remotely within reach.Yet the gradual tightening of global fuel-efficiency standards from 2020 on is forcing automakers to assess their options, including the application of advanced technology.Says Nissan’s Yamashita: “It is not possible to meet (future) regulations unless vehicles are electrified.”The harsh reality of the market and the public’s underwhelming demand for EVs, however, illuminate Nissan’s recent decision to shift more of its green-tech investment into hybrids.In December the company announced it plans to introduce 15 new hybrids globally by early 2017.At the time, Ghosn said, “We are going to continue to heavily promote electric cars, but at the same time, we are business people, we are pragmatic people. We will also develop and deliver hybrids because there are markets and consumers that require hybrids.”Last September, Toyota publicly walked away from plans to build several thousand electric cars, scaling back projected volume to a mere 100 battery-powered minicars.Both Japanese automakers, meanwhile, have forged new alliances to develop hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars, Toyota with BMW and, in a deal announced last week, Nissan with Daimler AG and Ford Motor Co.In the meantime, despite massive investments in battery technology and vehicles, even the most ardent EV adherents seem a bit ambivalent about the future of battery cars.“We don’t regret it yet,�� says Nissan’s Yamashita of the company’s multibillion-dollar gamble on EVs. “We might in a few years. No, we probably won’t.�� (Additional reporting by Paul Ingrassia in New York, Laurence Frost in Paris, Deepa Seetharaman and Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Martin Howell and Douglas Royalty)	4.450738418

BEIJING (Reuters) - China re-classified petrol-electric hybrid vehicles on Monday so they get more favourable treatment than all-petrol or diesel counterparts under new clean car rules, making it easier for automakers to meet environment quotas and offer more choice.China has some of the world’s strictest rules regarding the production of fossil-fuel vehicles, as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded cities.Those rules have pushed both domestic and international automakers including Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE to spend billions of dollars on the development and production of new energy vehicles (NEVs), such as all-electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Plug-in hybrid technology differs from that of petrol-electric hybrid vehicles.Automakers in China are obliged to manufacture NEVs to win “points�� to make up for a portion of the negative points they incur when they produce internal combustion engine vehicles.However, the system has been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve petrol cars�� efficiency.The policy published on Monday by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology allows automakers to gradually make more petrol-electric hybrids and less of the more costly all-electric vehicles from 2021 through 2023.Such hybrids would still be considered fossil-fuelled but re-classified as “low fuel consumption passenger vehicles��. Significantly, the number of negative points incurred for making petrol-electric hybrids will be less than for petrol-only vehicles.That could see more of those traditionally powered vehicles replaced with petrol-electric hybrids, experts and industry officials said, because when automakers produce those hybrids, they would not have as many negative points to make up for.Experts have said the beneficiaries of such change would include global petrol-electric hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T, as well as Chinese makers Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175.HK, Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd 601238.SS and supplier Hunan Corun New Energy Co Ltd 600478.SS.China hopes NEVs will account for around a quarter of all vehicles sold in the country by 2025.	-1.459455241

(Repeat for additional subscribers)Aug 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has affirmed Japan-based Toyota Motor Corporation’s (Toyota) Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at ‘A�� and its Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at ‘F1�� respectively. The Outlook is Stable.Toyota’s ratings are supported by its economies of scale, wide product range, resources to invest in various areas, as well as leadership in hybrid vehicles. Toyota also has a strong balance sheet, which provides considerable buffer against cyclical or FX fluctuations.Key Rating DriversStrong earnings growth: Robust sales and a weakening yen boosted the company’s operations in the financial year to March 2013. The company posted 19% growth in its industrial revenue and its EBIT surged to JPY1trn in FY13 from JPY61bn in FY12, recording a margin of 4.8%. For Q1FY14, the company’s operations improved further as the yen averaged 99 against the US dollar compared with 92 in Q4FY13 and 83 for FY13. As a result, the company posted industrial EBIT of JPY612bn for the quarter, more than double from the previous year, which is the highest level since the global financial crisis.Weak yen, operational improvement: Fitch expects the weak yen to continue to boost Toyota’s profitability given that it exports more than 50% of its Japanese production. FX accounted for JPY260bn of the yoy JPY310bn consolidated EBIT improvement in Q1FY14. Excluding FX impact Toyota also improved profits through cost-cutting efforts. This is in contrast to its main Japanese competitors, which were affected by higher costs due to increased investments.Industry environment benign: Globally, Fitch expects auto sales and production to rise in the low- to mid-single digit range for the rest of 2013, propelled by ongoing demand strength in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in emerging markets. Sales in the year to July sales in the US, a key market for Toyota, were up 8% yoy and Fitch expects light vehicle sales to reach 15.5 million units in 2013, a 7% increase from 2012. Growth in the larger emerging markets, such as China, India, and Brazil, is expected to be modestly positive. In China YTD sales for Japanese automakers, including Toyota, remain below pre Sino-Japanese tension levels but are showing improvement.Rating SensitivitiesNegative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include--Ongoing weak profitability due to steeper-than-expected deterioration in industry fundamentals-Negative free cash flow for more than two years-Erosion in Toyota’s competitive strengths such as in its scale, breadth of product line-up, and hybrid vehiclesPositive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include--Positive rating actions are unlikely in the short- to medium-term given the company’s vulnerability to FX movements and the cyclicality of the automobile industry	5.124687273
TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Sunday said it would suspend production on one of its vehicle production lines at a plant near its headquarters in Japan through Wednesday, after a second plant worker tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.In a statement, the Japanese automaker said another employee at its Takaoka plant in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture, tested positive for the virus, after it announced its first case of infection at the plant on Thursday.Toyota said the two employees had worked in close proximity to each other, and that it had asked a total of 33 employees at the site who had come into contact with the two workers to remain at home.

DETROIT, July 16 (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s global sales rose almost 4 percent in the first six months of the year as strong demand in the United States and China outweighed sliding sales in Europe, the company said on Tuesday.The No. 1 U.S. automaker sold more than 4.85 million cars and light trucks in the first half as demand rose at least 7 percent in each of its two largest regions - International Operations, which includes China, and North America.The results kept GM ahead of Germany’s Volkswagen AG in the race for bragging rights as the world’s largest automaker. VW reported last week that its six-month sales rose 5.5 percent to 4.7 million vehicles.Toyota Motor Corp, which sold the most cars globally last year, has not yet released its first-half global sales figures.Last year, Toyota took back the title of world’s largest automaker from GM as the Japanese automaker’s 9.75 million sales topped GM (9.28 million) and VW (9.07 million). Toyota held the global sales crown from 2008 through 2010 but fell to third place in 2011 due to negative publicity after a U.S. recall crisis and a disrupted supply chain following an earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand.GM’s smaller U.S. rival, Ford Motor Co, is due to release its six-month global sales figures later this month.GM’s International Operations, including the world’s largest auto market, China, had a first-half sales rise of 7 percent to almost 1.92 million vehicles. In China, where GM is the market-share leader, sales jumped almost 11 percent to a record 1.57 million vehicles.Sales in North America increased 7.7 percent to more than 1.64 million vehicles. U.S. sales rose 8 percent to 1.42 million.Sales fell 6.5 percent in Europe to more than 797,000 vehicles, and were down 1 percent in South America to almost 497,000.GM said its mainstream Chevrolet brand had a 1.4 percent rise in first-half global sales, to 2.5 million cars and trucks. Chevy sales rose in its three largest markets: the United States (up 5.6 percent to more to more than 1 million vehicles), China (up 6.1 percent to 322,000) and Brazil (up 5.1 percent to 305,000).For VW, sales of its namesake brand rise 4.4 percent globally to 2.91 million vehicles in the first half.	-1.49801284
BEIJING, July 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp posted its fastest monthly sales growth for China in more than a year in June, keeping the Japanese automaker on track to meet its full-year sales target for the world’s largest auto maker.The company and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 100,600 cars in the world’s largest auto market last month, a 41.7 percent increase year-on-year and the fastest sales growth since February 2014, when sales grew 43.1 percent.Spokesman Takanori Yokoi said on Wednesday the rise was due in part to “technical�� reasons, as the automaker’s sales dipped in the same month last year while it phased out the older version of its Corolla compact in preparation for the newer model.The gain, however, is a positive sign for the auto industry in China which has suffered a major slowdown in sales this year as the economy grows at its slackest pace in 25 years.Overall passenger and commercial vehicle sales for the industry fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in May to 1.9 million vehicles, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).During the first six months of this year, Toyota sold about 512,800 cars, up 10.1 percent from the same period a year earlier, putting it on track to meet its 2015 growth target for China, where it aims to sell 1.1 million vehicles.Weak sales have spurred General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG to slash prices and offer discounts in China in recent months.In March, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said overall sales of passenger and commercial vehicles combined could grow at below last year’s growth of 6.9 percent.Toyota has two 50-50 joint venture partners, China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co .

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged General Motors Co GM.N to reopen Ohio plant in a tweet on Saturday, ten days after the plant made its last Chevrolet Cruze.The last Cruze rolled off the assembly line a week ago Wednesday at GM’s plant in Lordstown, Ohio, the first of five plants in North America to end production this year and ending U.S. production of the Cruze.In a tweet, Trump said “Because the economy is so good, General Motors must get their Lordstown, Ohio, plant open, maybe in a different form or with a new owner, FAST!”Trump added “Toyota is investing 13.5 $Billion in U.S., others likewise. G.M. MUST ACT QUICKLY. Time is of the essence!”Over five years Toyota plans to invest nearly $13 billion.GM did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Saturday.	1.874320141
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is considering investing about 60 billion yen ($550 million) in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, the Nikkei business daily reported on Wednesday.Japan’s top automaker was also looking to set up a new mobility-services company in China, the Nikkei said.“We continue to evaluate our business strategy from a global perspective in areas of Connectivity, Autonomous, Sharing and Electrification to meet the future needs of our customers,�� Toyota spokesman Kensuke Ko said by phone.“However, we have nothing to announce at this time.”Toyota has made large investments in other ride-hailing firms such as Uber and Grab as traditional automakers race to team up with disruptive tech companies.	3.713927227
PARIS, April 18 (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen and Toyota are in talks to share vehicle production at a factory in northern France, President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a newspaper interview.Sarkozy, who last week summoned Peugeot Chief Executive Philippe Varin for discussions on another threatened plant, told La Voix du Nord that the Sevelnord facility was likely to be saved by the new partnership.“Sevelnord will be OK,�� the French president was quoted as saying, before adding that he had raised the plant’s future with Varin. “My understanding is that there’s a deal in discussion with Toyota for light commercial vehicles.”The French president did not say whether Toyota was the only potential Sevelnord partner in talks with Peugeot.Europe’s auto industry is grappling with excess capacity and cut-throat price competition as overall demand sags under the weight of the debt crisis. All major car makers except Volkswagen lost money in the region last year.Auto workers at Peugeot and alliance partner General Motors are bracing for a fight with management as both car makers prepare to cut European capacity.The Sevelnord factory near Valenciennes employs some 2,800 workers and produces Peugeot Expert, Citroen Jumpy and Fiat Scudo delivery vans. The Italian automaker plans to withdraw from the venture in 2017, and Varin said in January that Peugeot needed another partner to take Fiat’s place.“There’s nothing definitive with any new partner,�� a Peugeot spokesman said on Wednesday, adding that the terms of Fiat’s withdrawal had yet to be finalised.Even if a new partner is found, “we would need to ensure that the Sevelnord site is as competitive as possible alternatives��, the spokesman said. He cited French labour taxes as a factor weighing on the plant’s future.Toyota, which has ruled out buying a stake in Sevelnord, declined to comment on Sarkozy’s remarks or say whether there were plans for the factory to assemble vehicles under the Japanese automaker’s brand.Peugeot unions are seeking to put feared plant closures at the centre of France’s presidential election campaign, which culminates with a second round of voting on May 6.Sarkozy, trailing Socialist challenger Francois Hollande in opinion polls, summoned Varin for talks on April 14 after workers from Peugeot’s Aulnay plant near Paris organised a protest outside his campaign headquarters.	-6.223254677

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s labor unions are less aggressive in pressing companies for pay raises than Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is, the nation’s top labor leader said, a further sign of trouble for the government’s efforts to pull the economy out of deflation.Rikio Kozu, president of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, told Reuters on Wednesday that unions should prioritize wage hikes that are sustainable, suggesting Abe’s push is unrealistic.The head of the federation, known as Rengo, also questioned Abe’s aim of expanding the economy by one-fifth to 600 trillion yen ($5.07 trillion) in five years, calling the plan “nothing but pie in the sky��.The premier has piled pressure on companies to raise wages in a bid to pull Japan out of two decades of deflation and stagnation.But many firms have resisted his calls for higher pay due to uncertainty at a time when China’s slowing growth raises fears of deepening global slowdown and financial market turmoil.“I hear government officials saying labor unions should demand higher wages but I’m skeptical of such a viewpoint,�� Kozu said. “If making stronger demand raises the standard of every worker’s income, we would raise our demand more.”Rengo seeks a base pay raise of about 2 percent, less than the 3 percent Abe sees needed to meet the growth target. The 2 percent demand is more realistic and helps nurture the atmosphere that wage hikes would be sustained, Kozu said.Japan’s leading blue-chip companies agreed in 2014 to an average wage hike of 2.19 percent and they consented last year to a 17-year high of 2.38 percent.But including part-timers and employees at small firms that employ seven out of 10 workers, overall per-capita wage growth hovers far below 1 percent, underscoring the challenge of spreading the trickle-down of Abenomics.Rengo and the biggest business lobby, Keidanren, begin annual wage negotiations this month. Japan’s major firms announce wage plans in March.Policymakers are watching how much companies raise wages through the annual negotiations. A disappointing result could dampen Abe’s aim to boost consumption and further jeopardize the Bank of Japan’s 2 percent inflation target.Toyota Motor Corp’s union, Japan’s biggest, plans to seek a third consecutive increase in monthly base pay, but just by 3,000 yen - half the amount it sought last year, domestic media reported.Bellwether Toyota’s move sets the tone in the annual wage negotiations across broader sectors.	-6.948146874
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian government customs provisions are expected to soften the blow on the country’s powerful automotive industry from retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, according to trade lawyers and industry leaders bracing for higher costs.Decades-old programs reduce or refund import duties on supplies like steel when companies in Canada can show the material is used in export products. They could protect the auto industry’s supply contracts covering raw materials and parts, which often cross borders several times before a vehicle is finished.While imposing tariffs against a long list of U.S. products this month, Canada clarified that “duties relief�� and “duty drawback�� programs would be available to Canadian exporters.“That provision in the notice is overwhelmingly directed at the auto industry,�� said Jesse Goldman, a trade lawyer at Borden Ladner Gervais. Without drawbacks, Goldman said, the Canadian retaliation would have “very significantly and very quickly�� hurt the industry.Some 85 percent of vehicles built in Canada in 2016 were exported, meaning duty relief programs could refund roughly 85 percent of retaliatory tariffs paid by automakers.Canada has vowed to defend the steel and aluminum industries, but vehicle manufacturing employs some 136,000, according to Statistics Canada, whereas only about 22,000 work in the steel sector, giving the government an incentive to shelter vehicle and parts makers from rising costs.“These existing programs continue to be in place and any changes would be done in consultation with the relevant stakeholders,�� federal Finance Department spokesman Jack Aubry said when asked whether the programs would continue.Automakers with operations in Canada include General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T which assemble vehicles, as well as parts makers Magna International MG.TO and Linamar Corp LNR.TO. Linamar Chief Executive Linda Hasenfratz said in an emailed statement the drawback programs are of particular benefit to her company, Canada’s second largest auto parts maker, since substantially all the steel that the company imports is later exported.Honda said it was still assessing the impact of the tariffs. GM, Fiat Chrysler and Magna declined to comment. Ford and Toyota did not respond to requests for comment.The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers�� Association needs to do more analysis before commenting on whether drawbacks could protect his industry, President Mark Nantais said. “There are various options that could be used - that would be one of them,�� he added.But any relief would be temporary if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on Canadian-made vehicles after the administration’s Section 232 national security probe into autos wraps up. The rebate programs limit the impact of tariffs on raw materials, not finished products.Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers�� Association, said some companies that make stainless steel parts or hardened steel tools in Canada could benefit.Volpe said just over half of Canadian-made auto parts are exported.John Boscariol, who leads McCarthy Tetrault’s international trade and investment law group, said access to the duty relief programs had not been a foregone conclusion before the government’s notice, because Canada’s retaliation is technically a “surtax,�� not a normal duty.Some uncertainty remains as companies must apply individually for the refunds, and carefully document how imports are used, he added.“It introduces costs and complications, and it introduces a likelihood that you might not get that relief,�� Boscariol said. “That’s not without cost.��	-5.914601189
TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will raise its operating profit forecast for the year to next March to 2.2 trillion yen ($22.32 billion) from its prior forecast of 1.94 trillion yen, public broadcaster NHK reported on Wednesday.Toyota is scheduled to report results for the July-September quarter at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) on Wednesday, after the market close, and several analysts also expect it to raise its profit forecasts for the full year given strong sales in the key U.S. market and benefits from a weak yen.	-5
BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) - Peugeot maker PSA PEUP.PA has offered to boost Japanese rival Toyota 7203.T to try to address EU antitrust concerns about its plan to create the world's fourth-biggest carmaker with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), people familiar with the matter said on Friday.PSA has offered to increase the production capacity for Toyota in their van joint venture, one of the sources said. Another source said the French company would sell the vans at close to cost price.PSA makes vans for Toyota in its Sevelnord plant in northern France. The van collaboration started in 2012.PSA submitted its offer to the European Commission earlier on Friday, three months after the EU enforcer opened a full-scale investigation into the deal with FCA FCHA.MI on concerns that it would hurt competition in small vans in 14 EU countries and Britain.“As of now, the transaction has obtained merger clearance in fourteen jurisdictions. As previously stated, closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2021,�� PSA and FCA said in a joint statement.The Commission, which temporarily halted its investigation into the deal in July while waiting for the companies to provide requested data, did not set a deadline for its decision.“The deadline is still suspended. This procedure in merger investigations is activated if the parties fail to provide, in a timely fashion, an important piece of information that the Commission has requested from them,�� the EU executive said.It is now expected to seek feedback from customers and rivals before deciding whether to demand more concessions, or either clear or block the deal.	-2.323358577

* Nikkei stays below 200-day moving average* Japan market may be pushed down on yen move for now - trader* Recruit attracts buying, rises above IPO priceTOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average tumbled 2.5 percent to a 4-1/2-month low on Thursday after Wall Street dived on deepening worries about weak global demand, while a stronger yen dragged down exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp.The Nikkei was down 374.90 points at 14,698.62 by mid-morning after falling to as low as 14,672.55 earlier, its lowest since May 30.The benchmark has stayed below its 200-day moving average for the third consecutive day.“It’s clear that people are avoiding risks,�� said Takatoshi Itoshima, chief portfolio manager at Commons Asset Management, adding that investors started to doubt whether U.S. economic recovery was strong enough to sustain the Japanese stock market.The U.S. economy has been a relatively bright spot in the otherwise darkening global economic picture, and investors have rushed into dollars as a result.“The yen is now strengthening without any supportive measures, so we are just going to be pushed down on moves in the yen for the time being,�� Itoshima said. “But I think selling is nearing a climax - unless there are further negative developments in global growth.”He noted that the S&amp;P 500 managed to trim its steep losses by the close, and thus the Nikkei may curb its morning losses later in the day as well.Exporters were battered, with Toyota falling 3.2 percent to a 4-1/2-month low. Honda Motor Co sank 4.5 percent to the lowest since January 2013 and Panasonic Corp shed 3.0 percent.Banking shares were also hammered. Mizuho Financial Group , Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropped between 2.9 percent and 3.5 percent.Despite the rout in Wall Street overnight and the prevailing risk averse sentiment, other traders said that some foreign investors kept cool.“It’s not anything panicky. The year-to-date performance on the S&amp;P is still up about 1 percent so regardless of people saying risk-off, risk-off, it’s surprising to see how well the U.S. actually held up until now,�� said a senior trader at a foreign brokerage.“People are just trimming positions rather than selling massively. People are paying attention to good companies like Resorttrust and the Recruit IPO.”Japanese staffing firm Recruit Holdings Co Ltd rose 6.5 percent in its market debut after a $2 billion initial public offering.The shares climbed to 3,300 yen, compared with their IPO price of 3,100 yen.Hotel operator Resorttrust Inc rose 0.8 percent after it raised its full-year net profit outlook to 11.2 billion yen from previously forecast 9.8 billion yen.The Topix fell 2.0 percent to 1,198.96, and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 2.0 percent to 10,901.65.

(Corrects to show GM planned to lower June rental sales by 20,000 vehicles, not by 20 percent, paragraph 5)* Toyota says U.S. June industry sales to rise 4.5 pct* GM, Ford, Toyota report drop in car sales, rise in SUV sales* Ford, GM gain in prices commanded for SUVs, trucks* Jeep sales up 25 percent in JuneBy Bernie WoodallDETROIT, July 1 (Reuters) - Strong demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks in June helped General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co offset slowing demand for sedans by allowing them to raise prices on their trucks.GM and Ford said on Wednesday increases in the average transaction prices for their vehicles, particularly trucks and SUVs, outpaced sales volume growth that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Ford, for example, said prices for its F-series trucks rose 8 percent, or $3,600, while sales volume for the pickup truck line dropped 8.9 percent in June.U.S. June auto industry sales rose to about 1.48 million vehicles, up 4.5 percent from a year ago, said Bill Fay, a Toyota Motor Corp U.S. sales executive.GM’s sales fell 3 percent last month as the company’s small cars slid from year-ago figures, including a 13 percent drop in Cruze compact sales. Sales of GM’s large SUVs also fell, reflecting fewer sales to fleets, a company spokesman said. But GM said average transaction prices for all vehicles rose almost $1,000 from a year earlier.GM said analysts may have not factored in to their expectations the automaker’s statement a month ago that its sales to rental agencies would fall by 20,000 vehicles in June.GM shares were down 1.4 percent at $32.87 late on Wednesday morning. Ford shares were down 0.7 percent at $14.90.Toyota said the U.S. industry would have an annualized sales rate for June of 17.2 million vehicles.The National Automobile Dealers Association this week raised its forecast for 2015 U.S. auto sales to 17.2 million vehicles from 16.9 million. It would be the sixth straight year of solid gains since the recession.While Ford’s sales rose only 2 percent, it showed the largest increase in the market in the average price of its vehicles, industry consultant Kelley Blue Book said.Ford’s SUV sales rose 10 percent but car sales fell 3.5 percent.U.S. auto sales, often an early snapshot into consumer spending each month, are expected to rise about 5 percent for the industry. Truck and SUV sales will again grow at a faster pace than sedans, aided by the low gasoline prices.Toyota, No. 3 in the U.S market by sales, posted June sales of nearly 210,000 vehicles, up 4 percent, roughly in line with expectations.Honda Motor Co showed sales of about 134,000 vehicles, up 4 percent from a year ago, on strong SUV sales.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� U.S. June auto sales increased 8 percent from a year ago, boosted by the continued strength of its Jeep SUV brand.Nissan Motor Co U.S. sales rose 13 percent, led by a 54 percent increase in its popular small SUV Rogue.Sales of Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep brand jumped 25 percent in June.Chrysler brand sales rose 28 percent, and its Chrysler 200 sedan sales were up 153 percent to 18,560 vehicles. Private industry data reviewed by Reuters showed that in the first half of the year, a large portion of Chrysler 200 sedan sales were to rental agencies.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T reliance on the U.S. market to drive record profits is deepening this year, its latest outlook showed, with strong sales of refurbished SUVs and Camry sedans expected to offset weakness in Thailand and other emerging markets.The world's best-selling automaker, which analysts say could be overtaken this year by German rival Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in global auto sales, also said it would stick to utilising existing plants to maximum capacity before investing in new factories.Toyota on Tuesday posted 692.7 billion yen ($6.76 billion) in April-June operating profit, up 4.4 percent year-on-year and its best quarter ever with solid U.S. sales, cost cuts and a weaker yen bolstering profits.That exceeded the 637.3 billion yen mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.North American operating profit rose 45 percent to 149.7 billion yen, surpassing Asia excluding Japan, which posted far more modest profit growth of 5.6 percent to 110.3 billion yen.“Conditions in Thailand, India, Brazil and other emerging markets are weak,�� Managing Officer Koki Konishi told an earnings briefing.“But we’re trying our best to get an additional 50,000 vehicles out of Japan to offset some of that, and to reach around 2.3 million in the U.S.,�� he said, referring to Toyota’s 2014 calendar year sales targets.For 2014, the company trimmed its global group-wide sales forecast to 10.22 million vehicles, a reduction of 110,000 vehicles. The Toyota group includes Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T and Hino Motors 7205.T.Toyota raised its North American sales target for the financial year to next March while cutting its target for Asia excluding Japan and China, although its first-quarter profit margins in Asia rose slightly.“In Asia, where competition is intensifying, sales growth is struggling but there’s no drop in margins and it’s nothing to worry about,�� said Kentaro Hayashi, an analyst at Tachibana Securities.Toyota, which does not plan to build any new plants globally until around 2016, is still giving no hints on what its future investment plans might be. The automaker has annual global production capacity of about 9.8 million vehicles for its Toyota and Lexus brands, Managing Officer Takuo Sasaki said.“This would suffice, considering our current production and sales balance,�� Sasaki said.For the year to March 2015, Toyota stuck with its full-year operating profit forecast of 2.3 trillion yen. That would be a record high, although just a 0.3 percent increase from a year earlier as the tailwind from a weaker yen that helped boost export profits runs out of steam.Toyota's shares ended flat at 6,042 yen before the earnings announcement, compared with a 1 percent drop in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei average .N225. For the year to date, both Toyota and the benchmark have fallen 6 percent.($1 = 102.47 Japanese yen)	-0.1886630649

IKEDA, Japan (Reuters) - When Daihatsu Motor Co launched the Mira e:S minicar in 2011, the Toyota affiliate thought it had found a model for emerging markets. The Mira e:S - e for eco, S for smart - was capable of going 30 kilometers on a liter of gasoline (72 mpg) for a sticker price of just 795,000 yen, or $6,637. And indeed, the car was a hit, super-charging Daihatsu’s earnings.A number of improvements �� in manufacturing, engineering, procurement �� went into the car. But the real secret to success, says Kosuke Shiramizu, Daihatsu’s chairman at the time, lay in taking something out of the company’s business model: the vaunted Japanese “keiretsu�� system.Shiramizu, now a Daihatsu advisor, says Daihatsu shaved off roughly $1,000 in the manufacturing costs of the car by dismantling its keiretsu - an informal but close interlocking business relationship between a manufacturer and its suppliers, cemented by cross-shareholdings and personnel exchanges.The automotive keiretsu system, pioneered by parent Toyota Motor Corp. and widely adopted by rivals, was acclaimed across the world in the 1980s and 1990s as an ingredient in Japan Inc’s success. Keiretsu, pundits preached, defused adversarial relationships between assembler and supplier, allowing them to share information and create better product quality. Hence Japanese automakers were able to leap ahead with vehicles such as the Toyota Corolla, the legendarily sturdy and reliable family car.Today, after two decades of stagnation in Japan, the dramatic shift in growth to emerging markets and revolutions in automotive technology, Shiramizu says the days of the keiretsu are numbered. Companies, he says, are competing for price and value by using market mechanisms instead of relationship-based arrangements. While analysts have been predicting the system’s demise for years, Daihatsu, along with Nissan Motor Co have gone further than any Japanese automaker in scrapping it.“The Toyota way is the high-cost way,�� says Shiramizu, 74, in an interview at Daihatsu headquarters in the Osaka suburb of Ikeda. “Keiretsu doesn’t work anymore. If we stick with it, Daihatsu won’t survive. Toyota might face a similar fate, too.”As Shiramizu reforms the way Daihatsu develops and buys components, Toyota, which has maintained a 51-percent majority stake in Daihatsu since 1998, is watching Shiramizu’s experiment with interest, he says.That’s because Akio Toyoda, the 58-year-old founding family scion who became Toyota president in 2009, has struggled to deal with the global auto market’s seismic shift toward emerging markets.In China, Toyota lags rivals such as General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE. Toyota lacks no-frills cars such as the Wuling Hong Guang, a 43,800-yuan ($7,050) workhorse van GM designed and sells jointly with its Chinese partners. Toyota’s cheapest model is the 69,800-yuan Yaris subcompact car.In India, Toyota’s “strategic volume car��, the Etios, has failed to ignite demand, chiefly because of its relatively high price tag of 570,000 rupees ($9,118), even as rivals such as Suzuki Motor Corp. sell cars for as little as 240,000 rupees.“Daihatsu could potentially offer Toyota a number of important lessons on how to effectively use suppliers to come up with a viable low-cost small car for markets like India,�� says Shiro Sakamaki, a Daiwa Securities analyst in Tokyo.And not just lessons but actual cars. Struggling to crack the no-frills end of India’s car market, Toyota earlier this year called on Daihatsu for help in designing affordable cars that could be sold under the Toyota name and through Toyota’s sales channels in India - an arrangement similar to one the two companies have in Indonesia.Shiramizu, who became advisor to Daihatsu’s board and technical executive after stepping down as chairman three and a half years ago, says his parts procurement reform isn’t meant to be a template for Toyota. But it is being taken seriously there, he says.“Mr. Toyoda is carefully aware of what we’re doing,�� Shiramizu says, when asked whether Toyoda is considering a similar reform. “He views our parts procurement reform as one experimental way.”Toyota has been making early moves towards a post-keiretsu system on its own. Toyoda, for example, has told affiliated group suppliers, such as Toyoda Gosei and Toyota Boshoku, not to always count on business from Toyota. He has given them the green light to do business with Toyota’s Japanese and foreign competitors, according to two board members who spoke on condition of anonymity. Toyota has also begun encouraging the company’s keiretsu suppliers working on similar technologies to merge or combine resources in order for them to better compete with major global suppliers such as Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] and Continental AGRyo Sakai, a Tokyo-based Toyota spokesman, declined to comment. “As a matter of policy, we do not disclose details of our individual dealings with suppliers or our purchasing strategies in general.”Two major shifts over the past two decades in the competitive landscape have been working against Japanese car makers and their keiretsu systems.First, Western rivals dramatically closed the gap with the Japanese. That was partly due to the fact cars have become easier to design and manufacture, because they are less mechanical and are controlled more electronically. Competition thus shifted to who could offer more value to the customer: the highest fuel economy, the sexiest look, and the most compelling functions for the lowest price.The other competitive shift came from the emerging world.Keiretsu worked beautifully for Toyota because an overwhelming majority of the finely engineered cars it made were sold in the high-priced developed markets of the United States, Europe and Japan.That began changing in the early 2000s, with the rise of emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey. These economies already collectively buy half of the automobiles sold worldwide today. They will account for an estimated two-thirds of overall global demand by 2020, when sales are expected to reach 100 million cars annually.For Daihatsu, whose business is mostly in the lower end of the market both in Japan, as well as markets in Southeast Asia, the keiretsu system was especially onerous. As it began buying more components from Toyota-group suppliers such as Denso and Aisin Seiki over the years, it was also stuck with Toyota’s lofty quality standards. Shiramizu says Toyota’s specs are often too high for vehicles that some Daihatsu officials describe as “sandals,�� as opposed to the dress shoes that Toyota makes.“Do we need parts and cars that withstand the desert heat in Arizona?�� Shiramizu asks.Consumers in Daihatsu’s key markets outside Japan - Indonesia and Malaysia - are also used to driving under brutal road conditions, which often force them to replace parts quickly. They don’t expect parts to last for five to 10 years, so they are more willing to sacrifice durability for price, he says.Shiramizu is an unlikely scourge of the Toyota tradition. A career Toyota man, he was known inside the company as “the emperor�� because of his command of the business - and his imperious temper. He reached the high post of executive vice president before being sent over to run Daihatsu as chairman in 2005. But there, he says, he came to see the keiretsu as a high-cost, inefficient burden. Shiramizu said his mantra at Daihatsu was: dissolve the keiretsu, or die.Shiramizu’s reform began in 2009 with a decision to terminate a routine redesign of its Mira mini-car in order to recast it as a strategic car: the Mira e:S. Shiramizu says the trigger was “gaiatsu,�� or foreign pressure, which he says threatened to kill the special category of vehicles in Japan - called “kei,�� or light, cars - that Daihatsu specialized in.Washington and Detroit have considered “kei�� cars such as the Mira to be a trade trade barrier limiting global automakers�� business in Japan. The Japanese government offers a low annual vehicle tax rate for kei cars - micro-mini vehicles powered by engines sized at 660 cubic centimeters or less - which Detroit doesn’t make. They account for 40 percent of the Japanese auto market. But the United States, a key trading partner and ally, was unhappy that kei cars were becoming increasingly indistinguishable from other low-cost economy cars with bigger engines in Japan. The redesign of the Daihatsu micro-mini, along with its new model name “e:S,�� was aimed at making its “kei�� cars a unique category - high on fuel economy and light on the wallet.An effort to come up with a car priced at $8,000 or lower was “way way long overdue�� for Daihatsu, Shiramizu says. The American trade pressure was simply the last straw, he says.By resetting the Mira’s design direction, Shiramizu unleashed the program of keiretsu destruction that is still playing out inside Daihatsu.His first move was to send agents of change - manufacturing engineers like Saburo Yagi, Fumiaki Fukunaga, and Yoshiki Inoue - into the company’s procurement office.Until then, Daihatsu’s purchasing office was staffed by non-technical types with little knowledge on how components are designed and produced and, says Shiramizu, “no ability to assess true cost.�� Instead of attacking costs, those purchasing managers put a priority on their relationships with suppliers - getting wined and dined and showered with gifts in the process, Shiramizu says.“ACCOUNT SYSTEM”Shiramizu then initiated another move: abolishing the “account�� system that governed procurement deals. The status quo, he says, made it almost impossible for new, non-Toyota-group suppliers to do business with Daihatsu, even when they offered better quality and price.Under the account system, only existing suppliers with Daihatsu accounts could supply parts to Daihatsu. These so-called account holders tended to be a more financially stable group of suppliers. Any aspiring new supplier had to ask an account holder to sell through its account. Shiramizu says the system tended to inflate costs because account holders charged a fee �� often 10 percent �� for letting newcomers use their accounts.Those back-to-back moves took down the two biggest obstacles preventing Daihatsu from looking beyond the Toyota group for parts.Most important, it allowed Shiramizu to deploy his new procurement leaders in the hunt for lower-cost parts across Japan - and beyond to China, Indonesia and India.Inoue, who was plucked out of the production engineering division by Shiramizu, and his team focused on China. The team quickly found Chinese suppliers of windshields, mirrors, speakers, and aluminum wheels at savings up to 50 percent.One of the team’s most critical findings was not a new supplier, however. It was the discovery that some account holders were slapping a hefty margin on components they procured cheaply in China.Shiramizu was furious. By February 2010, Inoue’s team had found two new suppliers, one near Shanghai and the other in the Hebei provincial town of Qinhuangdao, capable of supplying aluminum wheels for as cheaply as 150 yuan to 200 yuan a piece �� roughly half the price Toyota Tsusho charged for a comparable wheel from a different supplier. Daihatsu last year bought approximately 1.3 billion yen worth of aluminum wheels in China without going through middlemen.“We have too many middlemen skimming off,�� Shiramizu says. “Getting rid of those middlemen is the shortest cut to cost savings.”Akitomo Inagaki, a spokesman for Toyota Tsusho, told Reuters his company strives to provide “customised services�� that emphasize “timely delivery, safe installment and sound maintenance of equipment we handle��.“We don’t see ourselves as a stereotypical trading company,�� he said.This experience quickly led to an all-out drive to weed out the middlemen from an array of contracts. A key target was Toyota Tsusho, a main provider of manufacturing equipment Daihatsu used to produce cars in Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia.Daihatsu’s procurement specialists went factory to factory in Japan, and enlisted Komatsu Ltd, Trinity Industrial Corp, Toshiba Machine Co, Meidensha Corp and Toyota affiliate JTEKT Corp as direct suppliers, cutting out Toyota Tsusho.Buying directly from those suppliers has made the job of procurement specialists more complex. They have to ensure that the logistics for parts delivery are sound, making sure equipment orders are delivered to plants on time. It’s worth it, Daihtsu officials say. For example, the company says it saved about 10 percent on milling machines it bought from JTEKT Corp, which cost up to 30 million yen a piece.Inagaki, the Toyota Tsusho spokesman, said that if companies such as Daihatsu has the resources to allow them to do all the logistics for safe and prompt delivery then they might not need a trading company like Toyota Tsusho . “But in many cases, few companies possess such capabilities on their own,�� he said.Daihatsu’s new procurement system was crucial to the success of the Mira e:S, Shiramizu says, describing the car’s redesign as the start of a much broader initiative to help Daihatsu adjust to rapid changes in the global market and industry.“We still need to shave off another 100,000 yen to 200,000 yen to bring down the car’s retail price even lower, into the 500,000-yen to 600,000-yen range, if we are to survive,�� he says.The ultimate $5,000 car would ensure Daihatsu’s - and perhaps Toyota’s - success in emerging markets, he says.Shiramizu stepped down as chairman in June 2011 and the Mira e:S launched in Japan later that year. Still, lessons from the car’s redesign set off a wave of other moves now being pursued by the talent Shiramizu trained.In one such initiative, Daihatsu opened an office in Shanghai. Its 20-person staff now searches across China for low-cost parts, an effort that netted 3 billion yen worth of parts by 2013.The push last year went into hyper-drive when the China team discovered factory hubs in the eastern China province of Zhejiang for dirt-cheap generic auto parts �� or, as one Daihatsu executive puts it, “fakes.”Daihatsu discovered those generic parts in a roundabout way: on parts shelves of dealers and repair shops in Indonesia that stock them for penny-pinching everyday drivers.A quality engineer who took note of the rampant use of those parts in Indonesia told Shiramizu of his discovery, and a major push to search for usable parts ensued.The results have been mixed: Designs by the generic parts producers are often robust, but the production quality is unreliable, according to Daihatsu officials. Daihatsu isn’t giving up on China, but the officials say it is turning out to be a time-consuming effort.So how will Daihatsu realize a $5,000 car?One solution being pursued now is to produce on its own many of the core, high-ticket parts Daihatsu currently buys from Toyota suppliers. Those include air-conditioning and steering systems, drive shafts and wire harnesses.“Toyota suppliers aren’t going to like it,�� one official says, “but our basic philosophy is to go ‘in house�� - and that means no more middlemen.��(Read this story in a pdf: reut.rs/1wZNTEQ)	5.301223971
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will supply key hydrogen fuel-cell parts to Chinese automakers FAW and Higer Bus, as the Japanese automaker tries to promote the technology it continues to view as superior to rapidly spreading battery-powered vehicles.Toyota is betting the move, part of a broader offensive, will help push rapid adoption of fuel-cell technology in China. Fuel-cell cars use a stack of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity to propel the vehicle, with water being the only byproduct.Toyota, along with peers Honda Motor Co Ltd, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Germany’s Daimler AG, has been trying to promote the technology for nearly two decades. But efforts have been hampered by the technology’s high price tag and lack of refueling infrastructure.“Toyota hopes to cooperate with more Chinese commercial vehicle companies,�� Toyota said in a statement on Friday, to “promote the application and popularization of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) in China.”The Japanese carmaker will supply fuel-cell components to China FAW Group Corp Ltd [SASACJ.UL] and Higer Bus Co, with Shanghai Re-Fire Technology Co acting as local supplier.Re-Fire will be system integrator and develop fuel-cell powertrain technology that the Chinese automakers can use to make hydrogen buses, Toyota officials told Reuters.Similarly, Toyota in April said it had started supplying fuel-cell parts to Chinese commercial vehicle makers Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd and Beijing SinoHytec Co Ltd.	1.127138015

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp reported its first-quarter operating profit nearly halved, as Sino-U.S. trade tensions dampened demand for its components business in China and the battery business with Tesla Inc remained in the red.The trade dispute is making it more painful for Panasonic to execute its strategy of shifting focus to corporate clients and automakers from consumer electronics, after Tesla’s production delays already posed challenges to the goal.Higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods battered sales of Panasonic’s electronic devices, while the slumping automotive market in China prompted the auto industry to scale back manufacturing investment and took a toll on factory equipment sales.“Automotive sales in China slumped and dampened investment appetite�� in the automotive industry, Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda said at an earnings briefing on Wednesday.Umeda also said the Gigafactory joint venture with the U.S. electric car maker is still in the process of ramping up to the planned annual production capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours and related costs kept the Tesla battery business in the red.Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, posted an operating profit of 56.39 billion yen ($519.68 million) for the April-June quarter, down 44% from 99.96 billion yen a year prior.That was below a consensus estimate of 70.93 billion yen from eight analysts compiled by Refinitiv.The automotive business, which includes automotive batteries, posted a loss of 10 billion yen, larger than a year-before loss of 1.5 billion yen. It generated 20% of the company’s overall sales.Panasonic maintained its profit forecast for the year ending March at 300 billion yen, versus a consensus estimate of 319.97 billion yen from 20 analysts.Umeda said weaker sales of Tesla Model S sedans and Model X SUVs have slowed battery shipments from Japan and hurt profits.Tesla shares slumped last week after the car maker pushed back its profit timeline once again, reported lower margins and announced the departure of its chief technology officer.Panasonic has turned cautious about further spending on capacity growth for Tesla battery production, while it is planning to launch a new battery joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp.Panasonic shares have halved since late 2017, dragged down by concerns about a lack of growth drivers as well as the high susceptibility to Tesla’s fortunes.	1.50439747
* Toyota eyes global annual sales of 30,000 FCVs around 2020* Automaker targets zero CO2 emissions among new models by 2050* Sales of Mirai fuel-cell car total 350 since December launch (Adds company comment, details)TOKYO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp set what it called an ambitious target to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles a year by the end of the decade under a plan to cut carbon emissions nearly to zero by 2050.Toyota, which is betting heavily on fuel-cell technology as carmakers rush to develop environmentally friendly vehicles, said on Wednesday it had so far sold 350 of its Mirai fuel-cell car, launched in December. It retained a target of boosting production to about 2,000 next year and 3,000 in 2017.Potentially the ultimate “green car��, fuel-cell vehicles run on electricity generated by mixing hydrogen fuel and oxygen in the air, without the carbon emissions produced by gasoline-engine vehicles.“When we first announced the Mirai, we said we were at the start of the age of hydrogen,�� senior managing officer Kiyotaka Ise told reporters.“The figure we’ve announced today is ambitious, but it needs to be to keep the ball rolling.”Hyundai Motor Co is also producing fuel-cell vehicles for the consumer market and Honda Motor Corp is widely expected to unveil its own offering later this month.The Mirai target compares with the 1.5 million hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles Toyota aims to be selling annually by 2020, up from 1.26 million in 2014.Toyota said that cars running on conventional engines will have virtually disappeared by 2050.Sales of the Mirai are limited to Japan but Toyota has been taking orders in the United States since August.A global rollout has been delayed due to a dearth of hydrogen fuel stations outside Japan. Supply of the hand-assembled vehicles is also still very tight, with roughly three a day produced at a single plant in Toyota City, the company’s sprawling headquarters in central Japan.Toyota added that it aimed to eliminate carbon emissions from its production facilities by 2050 by using renewable and hydrogen-based energy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two executives at Japan's Denso Corp 6902.T have agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix prices of electronic auto parts sold to Toyota and will cooperate with an ongoing criminal investigation, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.The settlement is the latest in a wide-ranging investigation into price fixing for a variety of car parts that has ensnared nine companies and elicited guilty pleas from 14 executives.The Denso executives, Yuji Suzuki and Hiroshi Watanabe, both Japanese nationals, will serve time in U.S. prison and pay a criminal fine, the department said. Suzuki agreed to serve a 16-month sentence while Watanabe negotiated 15 months.Denso itself pleaded guilty in the conspiracy and agreed to pay a $78 million fine last year.The two men agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix the prices of heater control panels that regulate a car's temperature and were sold to Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and a U.S. subsidiary, the Justice Department said.Suzuki also agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix the prices of electronic control units, which regulate power windows, power locks and other electrical systems.In addition to the prison sentence, each man must also pay a fine of $20,000 and cooperate with the ongoing investigation.The Justice Department's Antitrust Division has also settled with Autoliv ALV.N, Tokai Rika Co Ltd 6995.T, TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, Nippon Seiki Col Ltd, Fujikura Ltd 5803.T, Furukawa Electric Co Ltd 5801.T, Yazaki Corp and G.S.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's top carmaker, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, is expected to report weaker quarterly earnings on Tuesday, hurt by a stronger yen and recent floods in auto-making hub Thailand, but investors will be hoping for an upgrade to its full-year profit guidance.Thailand’s deadly floods last fall came just as Toyota was ramping up production to recover from losses caused at home by Japan’s earthquake in March 2011. Disruption from the floods cost Toyota 260,000 vehicles of lost output worldwide last year.That knocked Toyota's sales down 6 percent in 2011, placing it behind General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in global vehicle sales.The yen’s prolonged strength also continues to weigh on Toyota, which by far has the biggest operations in Japan. Last year, the automaker built 2.76 million cars at home, accounting for a third of Japan’s total vehicle production. It exported 57 percent of that, much of it at a loss.For the October-December third quarter, nine analysts polled by Reuters put Toyota’s operating profit at 93.9 billion yen ($1.23 billion), down 5.3 percent from the year before. Toyota is due to announce its results at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) on Tuesday.Last week, rival Honda Motor Co 7267.T reported a plunge in profits, hit partly by a 6-yen fall in the dollar for the quarter.With all but Thai production fully recovered, however, investors will focus on whether Toyota revises its operating profit forecast of 200 billion yen for the year to March 31.Consensus forecasts from 23 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S see a much higher 330.8 billion yen, counting on a sales recovery and deeper cost cuts.Toyota has forecast a 21 percent jump in sales this calendar year to 9.58 million vehicles, including subsidiaries Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T and Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T, possibly placing it back at the top of the sales ranking.“It’s premature to talk about any (sales) trends by looking only at our performance from last year when we had all those natural disasters,�� Toyota’s president, Akio Toyoda, told reporters last week. “I would want Toyota to be measured on how we do this year, provided it’s a peaceful one.”With the dollar trading around 76-77 yen, Toyota’s Achilles�� heel remains its heavy exposure to Japan.Toyota is scrambling to make its domestic factories more efficient to keep its promise of building at least 3 million vehicles a year at home. A plan to return its Japan-based parent operations to break-even assumes a dollar rate of 85 yen.In the near term, Toyota will benefit from the Japanese government’s recent decision to reinstate cash-for-clunker subsidies and extend tax incentives on purchases of fuel-efficient cars, especially hybrids and other cars that employ new technologies. Its newest hybrid, the Aqua, received orders equivalent to 10 times the sales target in its first month.Toyota's shares have risen 13 percent in the year to date, faring better than most other Japanese auto stocks and Tokyo's main Topix index .TOPX.($1 = 76.5850 Japanese yen)	3.655319683

(Reuters) - U.S. companies have begun to respond to President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican imports with mixed comments on the effects they would have on them and their customers.The tariffs currently set for 5% will rise every month until they reach 25% on Oct. 1, unless Mexico takes action to curb illegal immigration.The higher levies are expected to result in an increase in prices of everything from cars to avocados for American consumers.The following is a list of comments from companies on the proposed tariffs:Toyota Motor CorpThe company said the proposal to impose tariffs on Mexican-made goods could cost its major suppliers $1 billion.In an email seen by Reuters, Toyota Motor told its U.S. dealers that the duties could cost its major suppliers between $215 million and $1.07 billion.General Motors CoThe company’s senior vice president, global purchasing and supply chain, Steve Kiefer, declined to discuss how much tariffs could cost. However, he said, “the single biggest problem we have is the uncertainty with tariffs.”�Right now, we’re asking all of our suppliers to be calm and not do anything drastic.”Chipotle Mexican Grill IncThe U.S.-based Mexican-themed chain estimated a $15 million hit from Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican imports, and said it could cover that by raising burrito prices by around 5 cents.The company also said its margins would be reduced by 20-30 basis points if the tariffs were to take effect.Chipotle does not disclose how much it imports from Mexico, but according to its last annual filing, a “substantial volume�� of its produce is grown in Mexico and other countries.Campbell Soup CoThe soup maker expects full-year costs to rise between $2 million to $4 million, if the proposed tariffs on imports from Mexico were levied.The company sources some ingredients as well as packaging items from Mexico for its U.S. business.Levi Strauss &amp; CoThe jeans maker said the proposed tariffs would have a negligible impact on the company this fiscal year and that it would be able to substantially mitigate the effects of the levies in fiscal 2020 and beyond.Levi’s sources some of its products from Mexico, but does not disclose how much.Wright Medical GroupThe medical device maker said the proposed tariffs would have an immaterial impact on the company as it does not have any plants in Mexico, and both its customer and supply base in the country are very small.Aptiv PlcThe U.S. auto parts maker said if the Trump administration levied a 5% tariff on Mexican imports, it would cost the company $17 million per month.Company executives said Aptiv imports products worth a little over $3 billion per year from Mexico.	4.591920857
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba’s cash-strapped government on Tuesday began selling used cars for dollars at a single Havana outlet, a first for the Communist-run state and a further step toward the dollarization of a segment of its retail sector.Around a hundred people showed up to look at the cars, representing a hodgepodge of brands and models. Around one in 20 Cubans owns a car and the cost puts them out of the reach of many citizens, in a country where the average wage is below the equivalent of $100 per month.Yoan Orlando Milian, a 37-year-old who splits his time between Miami and Havana, said he had camped out for days to be the first in line to purchase a car.“I will do anything for my family. And this is a good option for my wife and kids in Havana,�� he said from the window of his 2011 Toyota Land Cruiser that he had bought for $80,000 - more than double the amount he might expect to pay in the United States.Cuba first legalized in 2014 the sale and purchase of cars manufactured after the 1959 revolution, but for convertible Cuban pesos, which are officially valued at a dollar though worthless outside the country.The state maintains a monopoly on foreign trade and retail sales.Previously, the new and used cars were priced at more than four times the factory price. Now available for dollars through use of a bank card, the government says it will discount 10% from the former price as it opens more outlets and makes new vehicles available.Reinier Ramos, from the central Cienfuegos province, said he had come to Havana three days earlier to stake a claim on a car.“I want to buy a Geely at $35,000 or MG3 for $34,000,�� he said, referring to two Chinese brands.Ramos, a civil engineer, said he had sold a car and received money from family abroad for the purchase.Cuba’s state-run economy is going through a liquidity crisis due to the implosion of ally Venezuela’s economy and the tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo under President Donald Trump.The government has opened around 80 “dollar stores�� selling items such as home appliances and car parts that it has to buy abroad in tradable currencies. The state had previously sold such items for convertible pesos.Cuban stores continue to sell food and basic household items in convertible pesos or its other currency, the local peso.	-5.838821875

* Merkel to meet auto chiefs in Berlin* German car makers lag rivals in sales of electric cars* Subsidy remains controversial within coalition govtFRANKFURT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel summoned auto bosses to Berlin on Tuesday to discuss ways to increase sales of low emissions electric and hybrid cars in the wake of Volkswagen’s pollution cheating scandal.Political pressure to do more to promote low-polluting cars has increased since September when Volkswagen admitted that it had rigged diesel emissions tests in the United States using cheat software.German automakers have for years relied on a recipe of selling larger, more powerful cars to please autobahn cruising clients and to juice the profits of its premium carmakers Daimler, BMW and Audi.As a result, Chinese and Japanese rivals including BYD and Toyota have stolen the march on German carmakers in terms of sales of zero-emission vehicles.BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi now rank 12th, 14th and 22nd respectively in terms of global sales of hybrid and electric vehicles, data from LMC Automotive shows.Germany is also set to fall far short of its goal to put 1 million electric cars on the roads by 2020, as drivers are reluctant to switch from more-polluting, but also generally cheaper, diesel and petrol vehicles.So far only around 50,000 electric and hybrid cars have been registered in Germany, Europe’s biggest car market.In response, German auto bosses and politicians organised a closed-door summit to discuss measures to help boost the number of low-polluting cars in Europe’s largest car market.The heads of the three parties in Merkel’s ruling coalition have considered introducing a subsidy worth up to 5,000 euros ($5,500) for electric car buyers. But Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a senior member of Merkel’s centre-right party, has spoken out against such a move.Under the proposal being discussed, carmakers may contribute between 1,500 and 2,000 euros of the incentive, which would be paid into a common fund, the weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported, without citing sources.This so-called buyers�� premium, combined with other incentives like preferential parking and the use of special lanes, have helped boost sales of electric cars in markets like Norway.Politicians and auto bosses are now looking into whether car companies could co-finance subsidies for electric and hybrid cars. But government officials lowered expectations on Monday that any concrete decisions would be made at Tuesday’s meeting.While Germany saw deliveries of plug-in and hybrid electric cars jump 80 percent last year to 23,500, China saw registrations more than double to 188,000, while U.S. registrations reached 115,000, according to Stefan Bratzel at the Center of Automotive Management in Bergisch Gladbach.Toyota is the biggest seller of hybrid and electric vehicles, data provided by LMC Automotive shows. It sold 982,968 such vehicles last year, followed by Honda and Lexus which sold 258,127 and 129,578 low-emission cars respectively. (Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Mark Heinrich)	-4.730846161
(Reuters) - General Motors Co warned on Friday that higher tariffs on imported vehicles under consideration by the Trump administration could cost jobs and lead to a “a smaller GM�� while isolating U.S. businesses from the global market.The administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat, and U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose a 20 percent vehicle import tariff.The largest U.S. automaker said in comments filed with the U.S. Commerce Department that overly broad tariffs could “lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less �� not more �� U.S. jobs.”Higher tariffs could also hike vehicle prices and reduce sales, GM said.Its comments echoed those from two major U.S. auto trade groups on Wednesday, when they warned that tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.Even if automakers opted not to pass on higher costs “this could still lead to less investment, fewer jobs, and lower wages for our employees. The carry-on effect of less investment and a smaller workforce could delay breakthrough technologies,�� GM said.GM operates 47 U.S. manufacturing facilities and employs about 110,000 people in the United States. It buys tens of billions of dollars worth of parts from U.S. suppliers every year, and has invested over $22 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations since 2009.Still, 30 percent of the vehicles GM sold on the U.S. market in 2017 were manufactured abroad, according to the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research. Eighty-six percent of those vehicles came from Canada and Mexico, while others came from Europe and China.Detroit automakers Ford Motor Co and Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles NV also import many of the vehicles they sell in the United States.“The overbroad and steep application of import tariffs on our trading partners risks isolating U.S. businesses like GM from the global market that helps to preserve and grow our strength here at home,�� GM said.Some aides have said that Trump is pursuing the national security probe to put pressure on Canada and Mexico to agree to concessions in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.GM shares closed down about 2.8 percent on Friday at $39.40.Toyota Motor Corp filed separate comments opposing the tariffs on Friday saying they would “threaten U.S. manufacturing, jobs, exports, and economic prosperity.”The company noted that Trump has repeatedly praised the Japanese automaker for investing in the United States, including a new $1.3 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama with Mazda.“These investments reflect our confidence in the U.S. economy and in the power of the administration’s tax cuts,�� Toyota said.Toyota noted that international automakers assembling vehicles in the United States are based in countries including Japan, German and South Korea “that are America’s closest allies.”The Commerce Department plans two days of public hearings next month and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week he aimed to wrap up the probe into whether imported vehicles represent a national security threat by late July or August.“We have received approximately 2,500 comments already,�� Ross said in a statement on Friday, adding that he expected more before a midnight deadline.“The purpose of the comment period and of the public hearing scheduled for July 19th and 20th is to make sure that all stakeholders�� views are heard, both pro and con. That will enable us to make our best informed recommendation to the President,�� the statement said.	5.510826233
HAMBURG/BERLIN Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE plans to cut costs at its core passenger-car brand by about 5 billion euros ($6.8 billion) per year from 2017 as it struggles to match the earnings power of global rival Toyota. VW's namesake brand, the carmaker's biggest division by sales and deliveries, is lagging a profit margin target of at least 6 percent because of fixed costs that it said are high relative to Japan's Toyota 7203.T. The brand's 2013 profit margin was 2.9 percent, compared with auto division margins of 8.8 percent at Toyota and 9 percent at Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS of Korea. Much of VW's production is in its home market of Germany, where workers secured a significant pay increase last year. Analysts have said VW’s profitability gains are disappointing given its steady expansion. The company looks set to hit a sales goal of 10 million autos a year in 2014, four years ahead of target.“Let’s be honest: We have a lot of catching up to do with our core competitors,�� Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn wrote in a letter to VW managers obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.“That is why we must now take action that is clear, effective and sometimes painful,�� the CEO said, pointing out that research and development costs had surged 80 percent across the multi-brand group since 2010.To boost efficiency across its 310-model empire, Europe’s biggest automotive group is reviewing its strategy. A post-2018 plan dubbed “future tracks�� will set out priorities on technology and model policy and may be outlined later this year.“VW’s and Audi’s product momentum remains tough for 2015,�� said Arndt Ellinghorst, London-based analyst at investment researchers ISI Group. “We see a real chance that margins keep slipping.”Winterkorn said VW may decide to cease making non-profitable models, citing convertible cars at the namesake brand which accounted for over a third of the group’s 47.8 billion euros in first-quarter revenue but only about 15 percent of operating profit.Other steps may include reducing procurement costs and improving sales channels, according to VW.VW shares ended 0.03 percent lower on Tuesday.The CEO’s call for greater cost discipline follows a similar plea in February, when Winterkorn urged senior managers to keep costs down to weather tough market conditions.VW toned down its 2014 profit guidance in February, saying core earnings may only improve if economic conditions improve more than expected, especially in Europe where VW sells about 40 percent of its vehicles.Staff representatives urged VW’s management to pay heed to workers amid the efficiency drive.“Management must cut out its own mistakes,�� Bernd Osterloh, head of VW’s works council wrote in a newsletter to be published on Thursday. “The focus needs to be shifted to whatever earns money,�� Osterloh, who sits on VW’s supervisory board, said.Separately, VW declined comment on a report by Germany’s Manager Magazin published on Tuesday saying that Winterkorn had agreed with leaders of the supervisory board to extend his contract by two years until 2018.($1 = 0.7331 Euros)	-1.896768779
TORONTO, June 5 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd on Monday downplayed news that Toyota Motor Corp would stop using its QNX software to run vehicle consoles, saying it is more focused on the faster-growing market for autonomous driving technology.QNX is a leading supplier of software for consoles that deliver video, mapping, hands-free calling and internet services to vehicles. Its software has been used in Toyota consoles for four years.Automotive Grade Linux, a collaborative of some 100 technology companies and automakers, said on Wednesday that Toyota would start using its open-source software in Entune 3.0 consoles of its 2018 Camry sedans, and then deploy it in most Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold in North America.Toyota is one of the first major automakers to adopt Automotive Grade Linux, a project known as AGL started five years ago to develop standardized open-source software for the auto industry.Its more than 100 members include Toyota, as well as Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp , Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co, Suzuki Motor Corp and Subaru. Chipmakers and other auto suppliers are also members.AGL said that Toyota had actively contributed to developing its software platform and would share additional code as it rolls out its new infotainment system.BlackBerry Chief Operating Officer Marty Beard said in a blog post on Monday that he expected AGL to take market share in the automotive infotainment market, along with regular Linux and Android.“But none of these challenger platforms is close to displacing BlackBerry QNX in safety-critical modules, areas that are growing faster than infotainment in the modern software-defined car,�� Beard said.BlackBerry’s QNX division said in October that it was working with Ford Motor Co as it develops increasingly automated vehicles, and executives have said they are in advanced discussions with several other major global automakers about similar partnerships.	-0.3246753247
May 23 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will raise its worldwide production target of Toyota and Lexus vehicles for the April-September period by 150,000 units to slightly more than 4.5 million, the Nikkei business daily reported.The world’s bestselling carmaker is also expected to boost domestic output by 150,000 units to about 1.65 million, the paper said.Toyota’s overseas production for the period will remain at 2.9 million units, as Southeast Asia’s economic growth shows signs of slowing, Nikkei reported.The company’s production plans for October and beyond remain unchanged, the Nikkei said.The company said in May that sales in the calendar year 2013 could reach 9.91 million. Toyota could be the first carmaker in history to sell more than 10 million vehicles in a year. (Reporting By Vrinda Manocha in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)	-6.52173913
PARIS (Reuters) - Twice Formula One world champion and double Le Mans 24 Hours winner Fernando Alonso has played down his chances of winning the Dakar Rally when he makes his debut next month.The Spaniard, whose main focus for 2020 will be a return to the Indianapolis 500 to try and complete the ‘Triple Crown of Motorsport��, said on Friday he still had much to learn about rallying.“If I go there to enjoy the experience, yes,�� he said when asked if he felt ready for one of the most gruelling races in motorsport, to be staged for the first time in Saudi Arabia.“If I go there to make the most of it, yes,�� added the 38-year-old, in Paris for the gala FIA prize-giving at the Louvre museum.“If I think on Dakar in terms of winning Dakar, I don’t feel ready. I’m perfectly aware of my lack of experience. I think in other races that I attempt, in Indy or Le Mans or Daytona, I feel quite competitive in a level that I could fight for victory.“In Dakar, I don’t think I am at that level and I need to be with feet on the ground. But I will play a different strategy. I will not be the fastest but hopefully I will be in a good position at the end.”Alonso is entering the race, which has moved from South America, with Toyota. Former motorcycle winner and compatriot Marc Coma is his co-driver.The Spaniard also won Le Mans with the Japanese manufacturer.He and Coma have been getting up to speed for the Dakar by taking part in rallies in Namibia, Poland, South Africa and Morocco.Alonso failed to qualify in a McLaren, his last team in Formula One, for this year’s Indy 500 after leading the race on his debut in 2017 with Andretti Autosport.“The intention is to do the Indy 500 next year. That’s the one that I want to win now and the main priority for me,�� he said.“I will prepare the best I can for that race. This year (Indy) was the downside of the season,�� he added of an otherwise triumphant year away from Formula One, which he left at the end of 2018.“I will need to look at the best possibilities, to be competitive. Last year (2019) it was sad not to be competitive enough or prepared enough.��	-0.7893438579

DUBAI, July 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) said it had obtained permission from the Dubai Financial Services Authority to operate a so-called Islamic window, underlining growing Japanese interest in sharia-compliant banking.Islamic windows allow conventional banks to conduct Islamic finance by segregating assets from conventional interest-bearing funds. Industry sources said it was the first time that a bank from Japan was operating an Islamic window in the Middle East.BTMU decided to take the step after Japan’s Financial Services Agency changed its supervisory guidelines, the bank said in a statement seen on Sunday.Japanese institutions have become increasingly interested in Islamic finance as a way to tap large pools of liquidity in southeast Asia and the Gulf.Last September, BTMU became the first Japanese commercial bank to issue Islamic bonds; last month, a Malaysian affiliate of Toyota Motor said it planned to set up a funding scheme that would include Islamic debt. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has signed an agreement with the private sector arm of the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank to develop sharia-compliant transactions.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has sold some of its shares in U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors Inc TSLA.O, the Nikkei financial daily reported. Toyota invested $50 million in Tesla in May 2010, ahead of the U.S. company’s initial public offering in June that year.Toyota said at the time the investment would give it a stake of about 2.5 percent in Tesla, but the size of its current stake is not clear.Tesla’s shares were trading at $236 on Thursday, up from their IPO price of $17.California-based Tesla has been supplying batteries and motors for Toyota’s RAV4 electric SUVs that went on sale in 2012, but that arrangement is set to end this year after Toyota sold just 2,000 of the vehicles.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company could sign a new deal with Toyota over the next two to three years.Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, said earlier this week it sold its remaining 4 percent stake in Tesla for a gain of $780 million. Daimler took a 9.1 percent stake in Tesla for around $50 million in May 2009.Tesla and Toyota representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.	6.069338922
Jan 4 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp said it will increase production capacity at its new plant in Mexico in the fiscal year that ends March 2016 to 230,000 vehicles from 140,000 vehicles.Mazda will invest a total of $650 million in the plant that is currently under construction in Guanajuato, Mexico, Japan’s No.5 automaker said in a statement on Friday.That includes a newly announced investment of $150 million for equipment to produce 180,000 Mazda vehicles and an already announced $500 million for plant facilities, a spokesman in Tokyo said.The plant is set to start operating in January-March 2014 with an initial capacity of 140,000 vehicles. The automaker will make Mazda2 sub-compact and Mazda3 compact cars for the North, Central and South America markets at the plant.The plant will also begin producing about 50,000 sub-compact Toyota Motor Corp vehicles starting around the summer of 2015, Mazda and Toyota said in November.Toyota will separately invest for equipment costs related to producing its vehicles at the factory, the Mazda spokesman said.	2.407620643
DETROIT, April 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is expanding a five-year-old partnership with Microsoft Corp to develop new internet-connected vehicle services for owners and dealers, Toyota said on Monday.The automaker has established Toyota Connected at its U.S. headquarters in Plano, Texas, to consolidate its existing connectivity services and serve as the company’s “data science�� hub. Microsoft has a 5 percent stake in the venture.The new organization “will make lives easier,�� said Zack Hicks, Toyota Motor North America’s chief information officer who will serve as Toyota Connected’s chief executive.Among the services to be developed or expanded under Toyota Connected are insurance coverage and rates based on owners�� actual driving patterns; connected vehicle networks that can share information on traffic and weather conditions, such as icy roads; and information services tailored to a driver’s habits and preferences, including monitoring heart rate, glucose level and other personal health data.The new wireless services will use Microsoft’s cloud-based Azure platform. Toyota launched its initial partnership with Microsoft in 2011. Ford announced a similar program with Microsoft a year ago.Toyota Connected will use Microsoft’s cloud technology to develop “predictive, contextual and intuitive services�� to “humanize the driving experience while pushing the technology into the background,�� Toyota said.Toyota Connected also will consolidate the automaker’s current initiatives in data analytics, data management and data services for dealers and fleet customers.In addition, the new organization will provide support for Toyota’s ongoing research in robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as development of self-driving cars.

NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - At least two dozen civil lawsuits accusing Volkswagen of misleading customers by designing some diesel models to cheat on U.S. emissions tests should be sent to California federal court, a lawyer in one such case said in a motion filed Wednesday.The motion seeks to consolidate Volkswagen litigation before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in the Central District of California. That court has been home to litigation accusing Toyota Motor Corp of concealing a defect that caused cars to accelerate suddenly, as well as cases accusing Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors of overstating certain vehicles�� fuel-economy ratings.Toyota agreed in 2012 to pay $1.1 billion to resolve acceleration class actions, and Hyundai and Kia won approval last year for a settlement valued by plaintiffs�� lawyers at more than $255 million.Since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced last Friday that some of Volkswagen’s diesel cars used software to deceive regulators measuring toxic emissions, at least 25 proposed class actions have been filed in seven states. The cases accuse the carmaker of duping customers into paying a premium for cars they falsely believed to be fuel efficient and compliant with environmental regulations.Volkswagen has said that 11 million vehicles worldwide could be affected, including nearly 500,000 in the U.S. The automaker’s chief executive Martin Winterkorn on Wednesday quit as a result of the scandal.The lawyer who filed Wednesday’s motion, David Vendler, said hundreds of additional cases could potentially to be filed, given the publicity surrounding Volkswagen’s admission and the number of affected customers. “It makes sense to get these cases in one forum as quickly as possible,�� he said. “Otherwise it’s like herding cats.”Vendler is an attorney with law firm Morris Polich &amp; Purdy in Los Angeles. He has filed a proposed class action against Volkswagen in the Central District of California.It is typical for large-scale litigation involving nearly identical claims to be consolidated, although the questions of before which judge and which court can be hotly contested as plaintiffs�� and defense lawyers jockey for advantage. The requests are decided by the seven-judge U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, which holds hearings every two months on such motions.A spokeswoman for Volkswagen declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese electric car maker BYD Co Ltd said on Tuesday it expected full-year net profit to fall by as much as 43%, as sales of new energy vehicles in the world’s biggest auto market plunged following a cut in government subsidies.The Shenzhen-based company, which is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett and whose products include battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, posted net profit of 119.72 million yuan ($16.95 million) in the third quarter, down 88.6% from 1.05 billion yuan a year earlier.It said 2019 profit would be between 1.58 billion yuan and 1.77 billion yuan, down from 2.78 billion yuan a year earlier.“As subsidies on new energy vehicles drop sharply, sales of new energy vehicles are falling short of expectations. It is expected that the profit of the company’s new energy vehicle business will also decline to a certain extent compared with the same period of last year,�� BYD said in a stock exchange filing.BYD’s profit drop comes as auto sales in China fell for a 15th consecutive month in September, according to industry data, dampening hopes for a second-half turnaround.Sales of new energy vehicles, which have long benefited from state support, have also been impacted by subsidy cuts, falling 34.2% in September following a 15.8% decline in August.Revenue dropped 9.17% to 31.64 billion yuan in the third quarter. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, BYD sold 107,723 cars, down 15% from a year earlier.BYD also faces intensifying competition as Tesla Inc started taking orders for China-made Model 3 sedans last week ahead of mass production from its $2 billion Shanghai factory expected later this year.BYD, which has a joint venture with Daimler, said in July it would develop battery electric vehicles with Toyota Motor Corp.Besides car manufacturing, BYD also assembles mobile phones, makes batteries for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and builds Skyrail, a monorail-like product designed for commutes in smaller cities.	0.8559919436

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan on Tuesday warned of more heavy rain on the southwestern island of Kyushu and bolstered rescue operations as the death toll in flood-hit areas rose past 50 with about a dozen people reported missing.The government said it would double rescue and relief personnel as heavy rain destroyed homes and caused landslides in what is shaping up to be Japan’s worst natural disaster since Typhoon Hagibis killed 90 people in October.Rain front was expected to remain over the area until Thursday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news briefing.“Rain is expected over a wide front stretching from western to eastern Japan,�� he said.Police, Self-Defense Force (SDF) and Coast Guard units were carrying out search and rescue efforts, said Suga, urging people to take necessary precautions to keep safe.The death toll has risen to 56 with missing, according to public broadcaster NHK. It showed swollen rivers, destroyed homes, roads covered in landslides and stranded residents being plucked to safety by military helicopters.Kyodo News reported at least 71 landslides across 12 prefectures, citing the land ministry, and said more than 1.3 million people had been ordered to leave their homes.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would double rescue and relief personnel, from day-earlier levels, to 80,000, including some 20,000 SDF troops.Some companies in the region have temporarily halted operations but Suga said he did not expect major disruptions to supply chains, as happened two years ago when deadly floods also hit Kyushu.The government will continue to liaise with local firms, Suga said, adding: “We want to quickly take the necessary steps such as support for small and mid-sized firms depending on the situation ahead.”Carmakers Toyota Motor and Mazda Motor, and electronics conglomerate Panasonic Corp all halted operations at certain plants on Monday due to heavy rain.Mazda cancelled the second shift at its plants in Hiroshima, and Hofu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, on Tuesday, with plans to open on Wednesday. Panasonic said its sensor plant in Kagoshima was operating normally on Tuesday.Toyota said it would keep all three of its Kyushu plants closed on Tuesday after halting production the previous evening for safety reasons, with plans to restart on Wednesday.	2.704865557

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese electric car maker BYD Co Ltd posted a 203.6% rise in first-half profit on Wednesday, as China’s new energy vehicle market continues to surge.The Shenzhen-based company, which is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett and whose products include battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, posted net profit of 1.45 billion yuan ($205.29 million), up from 479.10 million yuan a year earlier.BYD sold 145,653 so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) between January and June, up 94.5% from a year earlier. It also sold 82,419 fuel cars, down 44.9%.Revenue rose 14.8% to 62.18 billion yuan from 54.15 billion.BYD, whose models include the Song series and the Qin plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, aims to move to completely electric-powered vehicles. It said last month it would develop battery electric vehicles (EVs) with Toyota Motor Corp.Overall sales of NEVs in China rose 49.6% in the first six months of this year from a year earlier, but those sales fell 4.7% in July, the first drop in more than two years, as China cut subsidies on such vehicles from July.China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers has trimmed its forecast rise for NEV sales this year to 1.5 million from 1.6 million.BYD, which has a joint venture with Daimler, said the subsidies cut was likely to pressure companies in the industry in the short term, but would promote its healthy development over the long term.BYD will launch models such as e2, e3 and a revamped Qin in the second half of this year, and expects the new models will further drive sales growth and support the leading position of the group in the industry, the filing said.China is considering offering favorable treatment to other vehicle technologies including petrol-electric hybrid vehicles, as a way to diversify environmental friendly vehicles amid a broader push to go green.	5.183185499
CHICAGO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will shift production of its Highlander hybrid sport-utility vehicle from Japan to Indiana, where the Japanese automaker will invest $400 million to expand its factory and add 400 new jobs.Toyota now makes the Highlander and Sequoia SUVs and the Sienna minivan in Princeton, Indiana, where the company now employs nearly 4,000 workers. Toyota plans to export some of those Highlanders to other countries.With the expansion, Toyota will be able to build an additional 50,000 hybrid and gas-powered Highlanders, Yoshi Inaba, president and chief operating officer of Toyota’s North American operations said during the Chicago auto show on Wednesday.During his remarks, Inaba touted the economic impact of the expansion and said each auto job would create three and a half “spin-off�� jobs. Last year, Toyota opened a new plant in Mississippi to make Corolla cars that were built in Japan, creating 2,000 new jobs.“As a result of moving Highlander hybrid production to Princeton from Japan and expanding capacity for the gas model, we will create 400 more American jobs and many more at our U.S. suppliers,�� Inaba said.Toyota is readying a burst of new models due in the United States this year that the automaker hopes will help it regain lost ground after a tough 2011 marred by production losses in the wake of the March earthquake in Japan.Last week, Toyota officials noted that competition in North America has stiffened this year as the Detroit automakers improve their quality.The move also comes as Toyota and other Japanese companies are also seeking ways to temper the effect of the strengthening yen against the U.S. dollar.The soaring yen makes it cheaper to buy commodities and potentially buy overseas assets, but it also diminishes earnings from major auto markets such as the United States.In November, President Akio Toyota said the company may “deepen alliances with suppliers and dealers�� to offset the yen.	2.349159248

IRVINE, California (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it will be ready to bring fully self-driving vehicles to market by 2020.The Japanese automaker said it plans to offer “multiple, commercially viable�� vehicles that are capable of autonomous operation without driver input.The self-driving vehicles will be sold “at realistic prices for consumers,�� the company said at a media event in Irvine, California.Nissan said its goal is to offer autonomous cars “across the model range within two vehicle generations�� - about 10-12 years after the projected 2020 launch.The company said it has been researching and developing autonomous vehicles “for years�� with such top universities as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford, Oxford, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Tokyo. It is building a dedicated test track in Japan for autonomous vehicles that will be completed by next spring.Google Inc, the Internet search leader, launched an autonomous car program in 2010 and has built and is testing several different versions, including one based on Toyota Motor Corp’s Prius.	5.124687273
PARIS (Reuters) - Former Nissan Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn took a swipe at his old employers in a newspaper interview on Sunday, calling the Renault and Nissan results “pathetic��, driven as much by a lack of joint leadership than the COVID-19 pandemic.Ghosn, who was also the chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp, was arrested in Japan in late 2018 on charges of underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purpose - charges he denies. He fled to Lebanon from Japan.“There is a market confidence problem in the alliance. Personally, I find the results of Nissan and Renault pathetic. The two companies are looking inwards. There is no longer any real mix of management between Renault and Nissan, but a distrustful distance, �� he told Le Parisien newspaper.Ghosn compared the share price fall from November 2018 to June 2020 of competitors General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp of 12% and 15% respectively to Nissan dropping 55% and Renault 70%.“All of these manufacturers are facing the same COVID crisis, but Renault and Nissan are being punished more than the others,�� he said.Ghosn fled Japan to Lebanon, his childhood home, in December as he awaited trial on charges of underreporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.Ghosn was questioned in Lebanon in January. He has said he will cooperate fully with the Lebanese judicial process, but it is unclear what cooperation there will be between Tokyo and Beirut.French prosecutors have also stepped up their investigation into alleged misappropriation by Ghosn of funds at Renault and had summoned him in France on July 13, but he did not attend.“There is a technical obstacle. My passport is in the hands of the attorney general in Lebanon, because Japan has issued an international arrest warrant for me,�� Ghosn said.“I also want to be sure that my security is assured and that I am guaranteed freedom of movement.��	6.230358265
BEIJING/DETROIT (Reuters) - China’s Didi Chuxing, already disrupting the global ride-hailing market and taking on U.S. rival Uber, has its sights set on an even bigger potential prize: designing and getting built its own dedicated fleet of Didi cars.The firm has put together teams of automotive designers and engineers, and is now looking to work with established car makers to develop “purpose-built�� vehicles, people close to the company told Reuters, a move that could shake up the auto market in China and beyond.The move underscores how tech firms, from software makers for self-driving vehicles to car-sharing platforms, are disrupting traditional automakers such as Ford Motor and Nissan, amid major shifts towards electric cars and pay-per-use models.In response, some global automakers are now starting to bill themselves as “mobility�� companies that do more than just build and sell vehicles.Didi officials say the disruptive change sweeping the industry means there is a clear mutual interest in new players like itself and traditional manufacturers working together to develop and improve ride-hailing and sharing platforms.“Traditional automakers have different skillsets and understanding of the market, and those are all valuable to us,�� Kevin Chen, general manager of Didi’s automotive service platform, told Reuters in an interview.“It’s not like only we understand the customer. We are open to every form of cooperation.”Didi is China’s biggest ride-hailing company, cementing its dominance when it bought out Uber’s operations in the country in 2016, and is preparing to launch car-sharing and other on-demand transport services.It currently uses regular passenger cars, but says as it moves forward it sees a need for more dedicated “purpose-built�� vehicles. Many would likely be electric vehicles, either all-electric battery cars or plug-in electric hybrids.Didi on Tuesday laid out plans at an event in Beijing for an alliance with 31 auto industry partners to develop a new mobility business model in China and beyond for sharing cars.The alliance aims to develop “unified standards for the design and manufacturing of new energy vehicles, development of intelligent driving technologies, and planning of charging facilities��, the firm said.It will also help Didi develop its purpose-built cars, with the company offering its customer and operational skills to automakers wanting to develop their own ride-sharing services in return for design expertise.Didi already has a small but expanding team of automotive designers, engineers, quality control and battery experts, according to the three sources close to the company.Those experts are scrambling to develop vehicles for a shared car service the Beijing-based company is testing in Hangzhou, in eastern China, for an eventual nationwide rollout, they said.“We’re designing customised cars because without hardware product, you can’t be a serious mobility company,�� one of the people said.Three people close to the company said GAC Motor and CHJ Automotive have already began collaborating on projects with Didi to design purpose-built electric vehicles (EVs).The move signals that, even as a host of established automakers gear up to show off their latest models when the Beijing auto show opens later this week, a new battleground could be opening up in the automotive engineering and design centres of some ride-hailing and car-sharing services companies.As car-hailing becomes an increasingly popular option for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, Didi is betting that vehicles purpose-built for such services could start to replace familiar everyday automobiles like the Toyota Camry or the Honda Civic.Industry experts and officials remain divided on how quickly such a future might arrive.The people close to Didi pointed to the fact that most personal vehicles sit idle in parking lots for 22 hours a day or more. On top that, “parking is expensive, you need to maintain your car and pay insurance to drive��, one of them said.Uber Technologies Inc, the largest U.S. ride and delivery services firm, has not yet begun to build the sort of in-house design capability that Didi is contemplating. Uber does not have a formal design group, but it has began working with a number of vehicle manufacturers across topics that might include future vehicle design, according to a spokesperson.A recent partnership with Toyota Motor Corp, which has a minority stake in the company, calls for Uber to provide design feedback on the interior of Toyota’s e-Palette self-driving vehicle. Didi has struck a similar deal with Toyota.Lyft, the second largest U.S. ride services firm, does not have a formal design group, either. It has provided input to at least one manufacturer’s advanced design team, according to a source with knowledge of that input.Didi’s designers and engineers envisage dedicated vehicles that will likely look very different to the cars used today for commuting and running errands, the people close to the company said.For example, they say current mainstream cars are heavily “overspecced�� - packed with equipment most drivers do not need such as engines and other technologies that allow them to go as fast a 150 mph (250 kmph).Performance levels for ride-hailing and car-sharing service vehicles could be dialled down significantly, meaning they would not have to be so aerodynamic. Cars designed to carry just one or two people at a time to work or the shops could therefore be “boxier��, with fewer seats and more space for luggage.“We are redefining the definition of the regular day-to-day car,�� one of the sources said.	2.293967715
JAKARTA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Car sales in Indonesia are likely to recover next year, but not by much, after plunging this year during an economic slowdown, an industry association executive said on Thursday.The auto industry is an important part of Indonesia’s economy and car sales are often used to gauge private consumption.This year, 849,609 cars were sold from January to October , down 12% from the same period a year earlier.The automotive industry association Gaikindo has cut its sales estimate for this year to around 1 million from 1.1 million, co-chairman Jongkie D. Sugiarto said.“In 2019, there were political campaigns, elections -- for nearly six months people’s concentration was on other things and they didn’t think about buying or changing cars,�� he said.The association expects sales to rise by 5% next year, with economic conditions stable and interest rates lower, he said, adding that he hopes gross domestic product will grow around 5%.Indonesia’s central bank has trimmed interest rates four times by a total of 100 basis points this year to counter the global economic slowdown, measures that eventually will make car loans cheaper.This year, GDP growth is set to slow for the first time in four years to 5.05%, from 5.17% in 2018, according to government estimates. The government targets 5.3% growth in 2020, though its targets have rarely been achieved.Gaikindo’s sales outlook is in line with a forecast by Fitch Solutions, a think tank affiliated with the ratings agency Fitch Ratings. It foresees sales of 1.07 million cars this year, down 7% from 2018, led by passenger car sales. Its 2020 outlook is slightly bleaker: 3.4% growth from 2019’s level.“We believe new vehicle sales will face significant pressure for the rest of 2019 and into early 2020 in Indonesia as a slowing economy results in used vehicle sales become increasingly attractive for consumers looking to cut back on spending,�� Fitch said in a report this month.“We however remain confident that Indonesia’s automotive industry will rebound amid measures to stimulate loan growth, which will feed into higher vehicle sales throughout the year,�� it said.Indonesia’s car market is dominated by Japanese brands, with Toyota and Daihatsu leading sales.

DETROIT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s global sales rose 4.6 percent in the first nine months of the year as strong third-quarter demand in the United States and China helped offset declines in Europe and South America, the company said on Thursday.The No. 1 U.S. automaker had nine-month global sales of more than 7.25 million. That included a 5.5 percent increase in the third quarter and puts GM ahead of German rival Volkswagen AG .Volkswagen’s sales in the first nine months rose 4.8 percent to 7.03 million. However, that does not include the German automaker’s Scania or MAN brands, which typically account for a combined 200,000 vehicle sales in a full year.Toyota Motor Corp, which sold the most cars globally last year, has not yet released its global sales figures for the same period but was the leader through the first half.Toyota’s groupwide total includes sales at Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd and Hino Motors Ltd.Last year, Toyota took back the title of the world’s largest automaker from GM. The Japanese automaker held the global sales crown from 2008 through 2010 but fell to third place in 2011 after a U.S. recall crisis and a disrupted supply chain following an earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand.GM’s international operations, including the world’s largest auto market, China, had a nine-month sales increase of 7.5 percent to almost 2.85 million vehicles. GM is a market share leader in China.The Detroit company’s sales in North America increased 7.3 percent in the first nine months to almost 2.45 million vehicles.Sales were down 2.4 percent in Europe in that period to more than 1.18 million vehicles, and off 2.1 percent in South America to almost 770,000 vehicles.	-1.443792464

FRANKFURT, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Daimler AG, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, has hedged its holding in Tesla Motors Inc against a decline in value over the next three years, as it seeks to broaden its alliance with the U.S. electric-car maker.“The objective of the transaction concluded is to protect the value of Daimler’s shareholding in Tesla, whilst allowing Daimler to retain significant participation in any further appreciation of Tesla share price during the three year collar agreement,�� Daimler said in a statement late on Friday.Tesla is supplying electric motors and batteries to Daimler for its Smart Fortwo electric vehicle (EV) and the new Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV, which goes on sale next year.Daimler, which holds a 4.3 percent stake in Tesla, said in October it would like to expand its cooperation with the company.“We are also demonstrating the long-term nature of our partnership and our intention to continue and to broaden the partnership in the coming years,�� Daimler’s finance chief, Bodo Uebber, said in the statement.Tesla shares have more than quadrupled in value so far this year, but they have lost 26 percent since their record high at the end of September, following reports of its Model S sedan catching fire in traffic accidents.Tesla also provides EV components to Toyota Motor Corp .	0.9977362287

PARIS (Reuters) - Renault, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Fiat Chrysler led a 29.8 percent European car sales surge last month, the main regional industry body said, as automakers used discounts to clear inventory ahead of tougher emissions tests.Registrations across Europe rose to 1.17 million cars, well above usual levels for the slow month of August and the 902,870 achieved in the same month last year, Brussels-based ACEA said on Wednesday.The tougher new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including Renault and Volkswagen to halt deliveries of some model versions that had yet to be re-certified for emissions.Ahead of the deadline, many boosted financial incentives and registrations of their own new vehicles to be sold on the used car market, analysts have said.“Some auto manufacturers offered pre‐WLTP vehicles at extremely attractive prices,�� ACEA said. “As a result, double-digit percentage gains were registered in many EU countries.”The numbers published on Wednesday for the European Union and four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries reveal that France’s Renault posted the steepest increase in regional sales, with a 56.4 percent gain. Its alliance partner Nissan’s sales rose 46.3 percent.VW Group sales jumped 39.3 percent, while Fiat Chrysler registrations rose 38.9 percent, with sales by its Jeep brand leaping by 158 percent.Forecasters expect the market surge to be offset by a sales slowdown in the remaining months of the year, in which the August discounters are likely to come off worse.By contrast, Peugeot maker PSA Group and Japan’s Toyota, which both had WTLP-compliant line-ups before the deadline, recorded August sales gains of 17-18 percent.	-7.181615065

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is recalling an estimated 50,220 Highlander sport utility vehicles globally, most in the United States, for a software problem that could result in the front passenger seat belt not working properly.The Japanese automaker said it was recalling the Highlander and Highlander hybrid SUVs from model year 2014 to update software in the air bag system that controls how the size of the front-seat passenger is read.A company spokeswoman said the air bag electronic control unit’s software is reading all passengers, regardless of their actual size, as small occupants. That could result in the front passenger not being protected by the seat belt with the necessary force, possibly resulting in injury in a crash.No reports of accidents, injuries or deaths related to this issue have been received by Toyota.The company will update the software in the air bag electronic control unit.Of the recalled SUVs, about 45,500 were sold in the United States, about 3,400 in Canada, about 1,300 in Mexico and about 20 in Germany, the spokeswoman said on Friday.On Thursday, Toyota recalled 466,000 vehicles globally, most in the United States, for possible faulty brakes and loss of a spare tire.(The Company officially corrects that the defect could result in the seat belt not working properly, instead of air bag not working properly.)	6.457179184

* Sold more than 1 mln cars in 2015* Will launch 15 new models in three years (Adds planned new model launches, context)BEIJING, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co sold more than 1 million vehicles in China last year, beating its previously announced 2015 target of 950,000 units, the Japanese company said on Monday.Honda said it will release detailed sales figures for 2015 on Friday.Japanese marques have trailed Western competitors such as General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co in the world’s largest auto market, in part because of anti-Japanese sentiment periodically flaring up among Chinese consumers.But Honda and Toyota Motor Corp began gaining back momentum last year, posting strong sales growth largely on the back of in-demand sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and helped by improving relations between the countries. Toyota will report its 2015 full-year sales on Tuesday.The two companies posted double-digit sales growth in the first 11 months of 2015. Their full-year growth is set to be a contrast to the overall market, which is predicted to grow 3 percent this year.Aiming to keep its momentum going, Honda said it will introduce 15 new or redesigned models, including eight specifically tweaked for China, in the next three years. One of the models will be a new budget SUV, a segment that continues to far outpace the overall market, to go on sale in 2016.Honda’s 2015 overall sales volume in China is still set to trail behind rivals Toyota and Nissan Motor Co, which both broke the 1 million sales mark in the first 11 months of 2015.

TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - The world’s best-selling carmaker, Toyota Motor Corp, said it was recalling around 185,000 vehicles globally, including the Yaris compact, owing to a glitch in the electric power steering system that could make the steering heavier.Models of the Yaris, known in Japan as the Vitz, that were made between November 2010 and March 2012, have been recalled. Toyota said it was also recalling the Verso-S, known in Japan as the Ractis, made from August 2010 to August 2011.Short circuits could be caused in the vehicles by water droplets forming on certain wires in the power steering control module. As a result, the power steering assist could be suspended, making the steering heavier, Toyota said in a statement.Toyota is recalling around 130,000 vehicles in Japan, more than 7,400 in Italy, some 7,050 vehicles in Germany and about 7,000 in France, as well as in other countries, including Britain and the United States, spokeswoman Shiori Hashimoto said.No accidents or injuries have been reported from the glitch, she said.Toyota will replace the power steering control module, which will take one to two hours, the spokeswoman said.

WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - An automotive trade group said on Tuesday it would tell the Trump administration that a U.S. threat to impose a tariff of up to 25 percent on imported passenger vehicles under national security grounds would cost American consumers $45 billion annually, or $5,800 per vehicle.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp , Volkswagen AG and other major automakers, will file written comments with the U.S. Commerce Department later this week, spokeswoman Gloria Bergquist said.“Nationwide, this tariff would hit American consumers with a tax of nearly $45 billion, based on 2017 auto sales. This would largely cancel out the benefits of the tax cuts,�� Bergquist said, previewing the comments. Consumers would also face higher costs of imported auto parts when buying vehicles from both U.S. and foreign automakers, she said.

BEIJING, April 2 (Reuters) - GAC’s joint ventures with Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd are aiming for a big boost in annual China sales to a million vehicles each by 2025, a recording of a GAC earnings call reviewed by Reuters showed.For its venture with Toyota, that would represent a jump of 47% from 2019 levels while for the venture with Honda that would be a 30% surge. Vehicles made by the JVs are mostly sold under the Japanese brands.The state-owned automaker will also aim to sell 1 million units annually under its own brand by 2025, Feng Xingya, GAC’s general manager told investors and analysts on the call on Wednesday which was not open to media.It was not clear when the plans were formed. For the current year, it expects industry-wide China auto sales to tumble 10% due to the impact of coronavirus outbreak although it expects its sales, which include sales of its JV partners, to climb 3%.The long-term plans come as the state-owned automaker expands manufacturing capacity.GAC Honda currently has annual production capacity of 770,000 vehicles while GAC Toyota is building new electric vehicle plants which will take its capacity to around 1 million vehicles per year. Those capacity figures, however, exclude potential overtime shifts.In 2019, when GAC Honda recorded a 4% rise in China sales to 770,884 cars, its capacity utilisation rate was around 119%. GAC Toyota, which saw an 18% jump in China sales to 682,008 cars was operating at 140% of annual production capacity.“We can reach higher production by arranging extra shifts at current plants...Capacity will not be a big problem,�� GAC Chairman Zeng Qinghong told the call.Toyota and Honda declined to comment on the sales plans. GAC did not respond to a request for comment.Sales of GAC-branded cars tumbled 28% to 384,578 units in 2019. For the year, GAC’s revenue tumbled 17.5% while net profit attributable to shareholders dropped 39%, according to a company filing.Asked about its loss making venture with FCA, GAC executives said the automaker will explore more opportunities to export China-made vehicles to Southeast Asian countries.To meet government quotas for sales of new-energy vehicles, Zeng said the venture with FCA will also sell some models under the GAC brand, a strategy it is also employing at its joint ventures with Toyota and Honda.	2.444406722
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An executive with Japanese auto parts company G.S. Electech Inc has been indicted for allegedly fixing prices and rigging bids for parts in some antilock brake systems installed in U.S. cars, the Justice Department said on Wednesday.The indictment is the latest in a wide-ranging probe into price fixing of a variety of car parts that has ensnared 11 companies and 16 executives to date.Privately held G.S. Electech, which manufactures, assembles and sells a variety of automotive electrical parts, previously settled with the Justice Department.The European Commission has a parallel investigation under way.The Electech executive, Shingo Okuda, a Japanese national, was indicted for conspiring to fix bids for products sold to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America Inc in the United States and elsewhere, the Justice Department said.Okuda’s indictment came in Kentucky, where Toyota has a large assembly plant. He is accused of being part of the conspiracy from January 2003 to at least February 2010.The parts involved in the Justice Department’s wide-ranging investigation have included heater control panels that regulate a car’s temperature, switches for turn signals and wiper blades, power locks, dashboard panel instruments, airbags, steering wheels and seat belts.Among the companies that the Justice Department's Antitrust Division has settled with are Autoliv ALV.N, Tokai Rika Co Ltd 6995.T, TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, Nippon Seiki Col Ltd, Fujikura Ltd5803.T, Furukawa Electric Co Ltd 5801.T and Yazaki Corp.	3.844015567

DETROIT, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling about 4,000 four-cylinder Tacoma pickup trucks in the U.S. because of a defect that may cause engine failure, the Japanese automaker said on Thursday.The trucks, which were built for the 2013 and 2014 model years, have engine valve springs that may develop cracks and break over time, leading to a noisy, rough engine performance.In some cases, the engine could stop while the truck is being driven.The problem emerged because one of Toyota’s two suppliers of the engine valve spring did not properly maintain the equipment used to make the part. Toyota did not identify the supplier in its press release.	-3.878464317

"Saline, Mich. - (Reuters) - Automakers could be betting on a potential boost in demand from a new federal infrastructure program to boost sagging sales and clear inventories of cars and trucks, the head of Toyota Motor Corp’s North American operations said on Thursday.Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told reporters at a briefing that demand for new cars and light trucks in the United States is slowing, and he forecast sales of 17 million to 17.2 million vehicles this year, down from a record 17.55 million vehicles last year. Inventories of some vehicles are high, and Lentz said he does not believe current levels of discounting are sustainable.“I will take 17 million all day,�� Lentz said, during an event to mark the $154 million expansion of Toyota’s technical center near Ann Arbor, Michigan.Lentz said the possibility that President Donald Trump could win congressional approval of his proposed $1 trillion infrastructure rebuilding plan could be encouraging automakers to maintain higher than normal inventories, in anticipation that the federal spending will translate into strong sales of trucks and other vehicles.“If you get a $1 trillion stimulus, that could add 800,000 units,�� Lentz said. “That’s one reason everyone is on the accelerator�� trying to maintain demand.Automakers soon must decide ""when is it prudent to lift off the accelerator,"" Lentz said. Toyota inventories are at about 68 days' supply, he said, lower than the levels at Detroit automakers General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor CoF.N.On a separate issue, Lentz said Toyota expects to deliver 3,000 of its Mirai fuel cell vehicles in California this year, although deliveries to some customers may be slowed because of delays installing hydrogen refueling stations. Sale of the 3,000 fuel cell cars would be enough to cover California zero emission vehicle requirements, he said.Lentz said he was pleased that the Trump administration’s tax plan did not include a border tax on imported goods. “Until I see its tombstone ... it’s never dead until it’s dead,�� he said.Toyota supports the Trump administration’s decision to review tougher fuel economy standards enacted in the waning days of the Obama administration, Lentz said.The company is pushing ahead to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, and the Michigan research center will be central to company efforts to use more aluminum and other lightweight materials to improve the efficiency of future vehicles, executives said."	-1.956145938
(Adds sales target)DETROIT, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is sprucing up its premium Lexus line with a facelift of its flagship sports coupe for 2017, as the world’s largest automaker tries to shake off its reputation for boring designs.Unveiling the Lexus LC 500 coupe at the Detroit auto show on Monday, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said that the new model featuring the brand’s distinct jagged grille, was the company’s response to years of public criticism about the brand’s uninspired designs.“I was determined to make sure we became a more emotional brand, and that the words ‘boring�� and ‘Lexus�� never showed up in the same sentence,�� Toyoda told reporters. “This is a brave, new Lexus.”Based on a flowing concept design shown in 2012, the new model features a V8 engine and a new 10-speed transmission system, and will be the brand’s first model to use a new, luxury rear-wheel drive platform developed under the company’s new shared platform production system.“We want to make clear the distinction between the Toyota brand and the Lexus brand,�� Lexus International President Tokuo Fukuichi told Reuters.“The Toyota brand is the anchor which delivers consistently high quality products to the mass market... Lexus is for drivers who are more discerning about drivability, design and quality,�� he said, acknowledging that the luxury brand may not have been delivering on those fronts in past years.Fukuichi said that the new model would be released “as early as possible�� in 2017. He declined to comment on pricing, but said that the company aimed to sell 6,600 cars annually.Toyoda also said it plans to market a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) under the Lexus brand “around 2020�� as part of its pledge that all of its vehicles would be zero emissions by 2050.A Lexus FCV would be the second model produced by Toyota which uses hydrogen as a power source, to cut out carbon emissions, following the Mirai launched in late 2014.

SEOUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - South Korean automaker Kia Motors Corp said Friday it expected sales to grow faster than bigger rival Toyota Motor this year, although the won’s strength coupled with the yen’s weakness would put its earnings under pressure.The company said global retail sales would rise 6 percent to 2.9 million vehicles, driven by China and the United States.Toyota Motor said on Thursday that its global retail sales would expand 4 percent to 10.32 million vehicles this year, topping 10 million for the first time as the weaker yen gave it a competitive edge overseas.Kia Motors said it aimed to raise its China sales by 15 percent to 630,000 vehicles this year, helped by the operation of its third factory there and the planned rollout of its new sedan.Kia said sales in the United States would climb 9 percent from a year earlier, to 585,000 vehicles, while South Korean sales would rise 5 percent to 480,000 vehicles.Its domestic market would be driven by the introduction of the fully revamped versions of the Carnival mini van and Sorento sport utility vehicle this year.Shares in Kia Motors and affiliate Hyundai Motor Co slumped over 3 percent on Friday after they posted disappointing quarterly earnings.Kia Motors�� operating profit fell 10 percent last year, whereas analysts expect Toyota to post a record operating profit in the year ended in March.Toyota plans to announce its quarterly earnings on Feb. 4.	-1.450627757

(Corrects dateline to Sept. 25)* Exporters have become expensive - portfolio manager* Key is to find opportunity in untapped small caps - local fund managerTOKYO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Long-term foreign investors are looking into small cap Japanese shares as the Tokyo market’s bellwethers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Sony Corp no longer look cheap even after considering the effect of the weak yen.Some fund managers have been dabbling in subcontractors of big Japanese exporters while others look at companies whose coverage by analysts is low and have been neglected by international investors.“Many export-oriented companies have become a little expensive to us,�� said Drew Edwards, portfolio manager at Advisory Research Investment Management based in Chicago, who has $800 million under management.Edwards, who has more than 40 Japanese stocks in his fund, mainly ones with market capitalization of less than 200 billion yen, instead picks up Daiseki Co, a Nagoya-based company specialized in industrial waste disposal, as one example.The sales of the company, which recycles disposal oil from manufacturers�� factories, are 100 percent generated in Japan.“It’s selling into Toyota and other manufacturers, so the weakening of the yen absolutely impacts its customers which in turn impacts them, and you’ve been seeing that flow through in its earnings and revenue,�� Edwards said. “Daiseki is a very good indicator in what’s going on in the market.”Driven by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive reflationary policies, the benchmark Nikkei has risen 41 percent so far this year, the best performer among developed countries.The gains were mostly led by exporters on the back of the weakening yen, which lifts their competitiveness abroad as well as their profits overseas when repatriated. Toyota has risen 61 percent while and Sony has gained 118 percent so far this year, respectively.After a big rally, foreign investors�� interest in Japanese shares remained high.The number of overseas money managers at recent conferences in Tokyo organised by Mizuho Securities doubled to 320 from its previous conference in February. Some 500 attended a Bank Of America Merrill Lynch event this month, about twice the number at its previous event a year ago.“I am looking for stocks where something is changing and the market is failing to fully appreciate the value of future cash flows, and where capital is allocated in an efficient manner,�� said Nick Anderson, head of equity research at Henderson Global Investors Limited based in London.Local fund managers say that the key to investing in small caps is whether portfolio managers can take advantage of their untapped potential.“If you look at the Japanese market overall, half of the companies have zero or one analyst covering, so we think that there is big opportunity in them,�� said Nicholas Weindling, portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management based in Tokyo.He owns internet-related stocks such as MonotaRO Co , M3 Inc and Kakaku.com Inc, whose stocks prices soared 94-216 percent this year.Even after these surges, Weindling intends to hold the shares for now.“We think that these companies have multi-year growth ahead of them.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Green car startup Fisker Automotive lost more than $30 million worth of luxury cars when a shipment of Karma plug-in hybrids was flooded during Superstorm Sandy last week.More than 300 Karma cars, which each start around $100,000, were destroyed at a New Jersey port during the storm, Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher said on Tuesday.The cars were insured and Fisker expects “no impact from a business or a financial point of view,�� he said, adding that Fisker does not expect any problems with meeting U.S. demand.The 300 Karma plug-in hybrids were among the more than 10,000 vehicles damaged during the storm at Port Newark, Ormisher said, citing details he received from port officials.The other affected automakers include Toyota Motor Corp, which lost 4,500 cars at the port, said Jim Appleton, head of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, which represents more than 500 auto dealers.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Toyota, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the loss of the Karma shipment.Nearly 1 million households and business along the U.S. East Coast remain without power eight days after Sandy hit the region, toppling power lines and flooding areas. New Jersey remains the hardest-hit state.The 300 Karma cars destroyed by last week’s floods were to be sent to U.S. dealers. Among them were 16 cars that burned during the storm after one car caught fire when seawater caused a short circuit. Heavy winds spread the fire to 15 other cars.The news is another setback for Fisker, which has faced several quality and financial setbacks this year. In August, Fisker recalled 2,400 Karma hybrids in August to fix a faulty cooling fan that triggered a vehicle fire.	8.057228916
* Abe wants to liberalise sclerotic farm sector* Abe negotiating trade pact that would cut import tariffs* Japan Agriculture lobby resisting reforms and trade pact* Some fear Abe could backtrack to avoid clash before local elections* Japan farms inefficient and tiny by international standardsBy Yuka ObayashiTOKYO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - After December’s landslide re-election, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s programme to revive the nation’s economy is set to meet perhaps its stiffest challenge, the nation’s sclerotic farming industry.He will soon submit legislation to reform agriculture, a sector where a dwindling band of aging farmers works tiny plots, while conducting gruelling negotiations to sign up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would cut towering import tariffs that shield domestic farmers.Standing in his way is Japan Agriculture (JA), a lobby group that controls most aspects of pricing and distribution through its network of about 700 farming cooperatives, and also supplies feed and machinery.It doesn’t like Abe’s plans to clip its wings, nor the TPP.And the JA, which has long had close ties to his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has financial clout - its banking business had nearly 91.5 trillion yen ($780 billion) in deposits in March 2014 - and a large membership, which give it influence over lawmakers in rural constituencies.In January its members campaigned against and helped defeat the LDP’s candidate for governor of Saga, a prefecture in farm-heavy southwestern Japan.Though agriculture is only about 1 percent of Japan’s economy, that defeat worries those who fear the government could temper what Koichi Kurose, chief economist at Resona Bank, calls “a symbolic part of Abe’s structural reforms�� ahead of nationwide local elections in April.“If they pull back from that to win elections, they can pull back from the whole Abenomics reforms,�� he said.“Foreign investors are also watching closely whether or not Abe can carry out agricultural reforms, which will affect their evaluations of Abenomics,�� said Chizu Hori, senior research officer at Mizuho Research Institute Ltd.At home, farmers hurt by another plank of Abenomics - loose money and a weaker yen - are also watching closely.Hiroyasu Sugiura, 67, whose dairy lies in the shadow of Toyota Motor factories in central Japan, says he is desperate.The tumbling yen helps exporters like Toyota but has led to a sharp rise in feed costs, which now swallow nearly 80 percent of Sugiura’s dairy revenue.“The weaker yen ... may have given Toyota Motor trillions of yen in profit, but we are getting squeezed by the same national policy,�� said Sugiura, who is also the head of the Aichi Dairy Cooperative. “We want the government to protect us.”For the consumer, however, high prices and a recent butter shortage are the pitfalls of a closed market for milk and dairy products, where output volume and sales prices are set by the state and a few designated groups under the JA, while imports are under effective state control.Raw milk production was 7.45 million tonnes in the year through March 2014, down from 8.66 million in 1997, while the number of dairy farmers has fallen to 18,600 in 2014 from 160,100 in 1975. Cow numbers have fallen by a third from their peak.Meanwhile, Japan imposes a 360 percent tariff on butter imports to protect domestic farmers while maintaining an import quota as a condition for such high tariffs under international rules of trade.Abe wants to break that system to give local farmers or cooperatives autonomy so they become more productive and profitable.Other reforms include a scheme to encourage land transactions so farms can expand.The average Japanese farm is only two hectares (five acres), or 1 percent of the size of the average U.S. farm and 0.07 percent of Australian farms.“One of the most important elements Abe needs to tackle is to make farms grow bigger to be more productive,�� said Mizuho Research’s Hori.Structural reform is critical ahead of the TPP, which would link 12 countries covering nearly 40 percent of the world economy.Disagreement between the United States and Japan, the two biggest, over how widely Japan will open up has delayed progress, though more talks are scheduled this week to try to get agreement this year.Japan imposes high tariffs on dairy produce, rice, wheat, beef, pork and sugar to protect local farmers, but under the TPP it would have to cut or remove some, and allow higher imports, putting more pressure on its beleaguered farmers.Some, however, are already removing themselves from the suffocating umbrella of JA.One cooperative in Hamanaka, a small town on the northern island of Hokkaido, now buys cheaper feed from trading houses, instead of JA, while recruiting young couples by offering a paid training programme and financial and technological help so they can take over land from retiring farmers.“We have no idle farm lands in Hamanaka. Five couples are on our waiting list,�� said Shigenori Ishibashi, the co-op head, adding milk output in the town had risen 25 percent since 1983.“We’re not afraid of TPP or the weak yen,�� Ishibashi said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - As Detroit’s automakers shut production in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor cranked up its factories back home to ship cars to the United States, a move that is proving costly for the world’s fifth-largest auto group.Hyundai ramped up domestic production to as much as 98% of capacity by late March, not only as the Korean market was recovering from a bad February but also because it bet on demand for Tucson SUVs and other models from U.S. customers, its biggest overseas market outside of China.Hyundai shipped 33,990 vehicles to the United States in March, or 4.3% more from a year ago, according to company data.While Hyundai is one of few global automakers whose production has recovered at home, its exports optimism has been dampened by the severity of the U.S. outbreak, weak consumer sentiment that battered the industry, and as rivals have quickly moved to guard their turf.Consignments of cars shipped from South Korea are now sitting in U.S. ports, with dealers slow to take deliveries because of slumping sales and rising inventory, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Reuters could not independently verify how many vehicles shipped by Hyundai and other auto makers are held in U.S. ports.The company idled a Tucson production line at home last week for five days. And analysts now expect a sharp drop in first-quarter operating profit when it reports results on Thursday and some even forecast a second-quarter loss.“I hope that the situation will recover by the middle of next month. If not, we might have to lay off some people,�� said Brad Cannon, general manager of an exclusive Hyundai dealership in California, whose sales are down more than 50% from when the pandemic started.Hyundai runs a factory in Alabama - which is closed until May 1 - but imports are key to meet U.S. demand. Only about half of its vehicles sold in the United States are made in North America compared to between 68% and 85% for Japanese rivals Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor, who have also suspended production there till May.Hyundai’s South Korean factory operation, which had recovered from a component shortage from China to nearly 100% capacity by March, could fall to as much as 70% in April, the company recently told analysts.“Hyundai Motor has been maintaining strong cooperative relationship with our dealers around the world and we will overcome this difficult time by further enhancing collaboration with our dealers,�� it said in an emailed statement to Reuters.“We will work to maintain the optimal level of inventory at each step of the supply chain... aiming for a faster recovery than others when the crisis softens.”For its part, Hyundai has taken measures to minimize the impact.In March, Hyundai was first in the market to relaunch a job-loss protection program introduced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis in the U.S. market, offering to cover up to six months of payments for car buyers if they lose their job due to COVID-19 this year.It has also revamped its model lineup, in a move reminiscent of the car maker’s success in 2009 when Hyundai was the only major automaker to post increases in U.S. sales through a revamp of the portfolio and aggressive marketing campaigns.But rivals, which were in turmoil a decade ago, are not standing still this time around. Detroit’s big three - General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler - have been quicker than Hyundai in launching attractive financial offers, propelling them to their biggest combined market share since 2006 in late March-early April, according to researcher J.D. Power.“I think the market has changed… I don’t think it will be like 2008. The other makers may be not as aggressive, but pretty much right there,�� Scott Fink, the operator of Hyundai’s biggest U.S. dealer, said. He expects his dealership to post a 40% sales drop in April compared with an 18% decline in March.While not optimistic about a quick market recovery, Fink said Hyundai would be still able to resume sales and market share growth, driven by new products like the Palisade SUV.Still, demand recovery at home, Hyundai’s biggest market, is expected to cushion the blow from the slump overseas, with South Korea’s new COVID-19 cases dropping to nine on April 21 from a peak of 909 on Feb. 29, without drastic measures such as lockdowns.Hyundai’s domestic sales in March hit their highest level in more than four years, up 80% from February, helped by a consumption tax cut. Hyundai also said local pre-orders for new models like the Elantra and Genesis G80 are strong.On Saturday, a Hyundai Motor dealership on the outskirts of Seoul was busy, with a steady stream of mask-wearing customers going in and out.“Customer traffic has fully recovered to the pre-virus level,�� said Lee Taek-san, the store’s general manager, adding some 40 groups are now visiting the showroom on a holiday, from 10 in early March. “It is a relief,�� he said.	-3.187021329
"BEIJING (Reuters) - Passenger car retail sales in China, the world’s biggest auto market, fell 80% in February because of the coronavirus epidemic, one of the country’s industry associations said on Wednesday.The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said in a statement that China’s overall passenger car sales dropped 80%, without giving a full sales figure for the month.“Dealers returned to work gradually in the first three weeks of February and their showroom traffic is very low,�� CPCA said, adding it expects February’s sales drop will be the steepest of this year.Japanese automaker Toyota 7203.T, the first major global automaker to report its February sales in China, said it sold 23,800 Toyota and premium Lexus cars last month, down by 70% from a year earlier.

FRANKFURT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen will continue to collaborate with Japan’s Toyota in the minicar segment in Europe, PSA’s chief executive told a German car magazine.“Yes, the next generation will once again be jointly developed and produced in the Czech Republic,�� Philippe Varin said in an interview with Auto Motor und Sport.Speculation among analysts and in the media about whether this and other partnerships would continue had arisen after the financially stretched French carmaker dissolved a components joint venture with BMW and ended an engine cooperation deal.PSA has been scaling down partnerships with other carmakers since its alliance with General Motors.The Citroen C1, the next generation of which is expected early next year, and Peugeot 107 are built on the same assembly line as Toyota’s Aygo in Kolin, Czech Republic.As of March of last year, the Toyota Peugeot Citroen Automobile (TPCA) joint venture had made more than 2 million vehicles, since starting production in February 2005.The Kolin plant’s capacity is roughly 300,000 vehicles a year.

FRANKFURT, March 31 (Reuters) - Loss-making German metals recycling group Scholz AG has attracted three bids as it seeks a buyer to inject fresh equity to put the company’s finances back on a solid footing, three sources familiar with the transaction said.Scholz, burdened by 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of debt at the end of 2013, has been hit by weak metal and scrap markets and launched a restructuring to rein in its aggressive past expansion, selling smaller non-core operations and shutting some sites.Japan’s Toyota Tsusho, an un-named Chinese company and buyout group KKR handed in bids before Friday’s deadline in an auction organised by Rothschild, two of the sources said.“There is going to be an equity value,�� one of the sources said, implying that Scholz’s creditors will not face any haircuts on their loans.Scholz, Toyota Tsusho, KKR and Rothschild declined to comment.A separate sales process for Scholz’s aluminium and engineering steel businesses is also under way as the group seeks to reduce its debt to 700 million euros, the sources said.Most of the debt is in bank loans, some of which have been bought up by funds such as Davidson Kempner, SVP and TPG.Scholz booked a post-tax loss of 314 million euros in 2013, hit by charges relating to the restructuring. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation shrank by 31 to 125 million euros.

TOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - A coronavirus pandemic is having a big impact on the automotive manufacturing industry, the head of a Japanese lobby group said on Thursday, adding that its members will need to keep adjusting production, amid a projected slump in demand.“The truth is, it was shocking just how much the world could change in an instant,�� Akio Toyoda, who also leads Japan’s biggest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp, told a news conference in Tokyo.“At this point, we can’t foresee what’s ahead for automakers,�� added Toyoda, the chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.In separate announcements this week Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co said they would temporarily halt North American factories to protect worker health and amid an expected hit to demand.They also suspended production at several plants in Europe, with Honda closing its facility at Swindon in Britain until at least April 5.Despite the uncertainty, Toyoda said he did not expect the virus outbreak to hit spending on research into advanced technologies, such as autonomous driving and electric cars.

(Reuters) - Sales of automobiles in China by Toyota Motor Corp and its two Chinese joint ventures fell 20.9 percent in March, while those for the first three months of the year slipped 0.1 percent.The results, announced by Toyota on Wednesday, amounted to what a company spokesman called a surprisingly weak showing by Japan’s top automaker in the world’s biggest auto market.Takanori Yokoi, a Beijing-based Toyota spokesman, said the newly redesigned Corolla and Levin models sold well during March, but sales of both the RAV4 crossover SUV and the Vios compact car were particularly disappointing.Yokoi blamed the big year-on-year slide in March sales mostly on the fierce competition those two car models faced in China. He cited, for example, dealers discounting competitive cars such as the Honda CR-V crossover, creating competition for the Toyota RAV4 and eating into its sales.Toyota and its Chinese joint ventures sold about 71,500 vehicles in China in March. Its volume during the January-March quarter totaled about 227,700 vehicles.Toyota aims to sell 1.1 million vehicles in China in 2015, after failing to clear that sales level and meet last year’s target.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc TSLA.O and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, the world's best-selling automaker, could sign a new deal over the next two to three years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, as the two firms ready to end an existing program.California-based Tesla has been supplying batteries and motors for Toyota’s RAV4 electric SUVs that went on sale in 2012, but that partnership is set to end this year after Toyota sold just 2,000 of the vehicles.“If you look at maybe two or three years from now, I would not be surprised if there is a significant deal with Toyota and Tesla,�� Musk told a news conference on Monday in Tokyo where he made the first deliveries of the Model S luxury electric sedan in Japan.He said the deal involve higher volumes than the existing partnership but did not comment on the details of what the deal could involve and said there were no definitive plans.A Toyota executive also said no specific plans were in place but added the two companies hadn’t ended their relationship.“There are still possibilities in certain areas of their operations especially in North America where we may find common ground,�� said the executive, who declined to be named. “It’s not like we have severed our ties.”Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the company could not comment on the matter.Tesla is planning an autonomous driving system, with part of the technology to be introduced in three years�� time, the Nikkei reported, citing Musk.The company will start introducing the technology in cars slated to go into production three years from now. These cars are likely to cost around $35,000, the Nikkei said.That is about half the starting price of Tesla’s first mass-market car, the Model S sedan.Tesla will make fully autonomous cars in the next five to six years, the Japanese newspaper said.In 2010, Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory in California after Toyota closed the plant and currently manufactures the Model S there. In return, Toyota took a $50 million stake in Tesla.In Japan, one of the first customers that received the model S �� which costs around 7.4 million yen ($70,300) after subsidies �� was Panasonic Corp's 6752.T Executive Vice President, Yoshi Yamada.Panasonic is set to fund part of the cost of a new $5 billion battery factory that Tesla is building in Nevada. Musk repeated the Japanese electronics maker is likely to fund 30 to 40 percent of the total cost.Panasonic also reiterated it wouldn’t comment on the size and timing of the investment.Asked whether Panasonic would cover 30 to 40 percent of Tesla’s battery plant, called the Gigafactory, Yamada told reporters: “Isn’t that all speculation?��($1 = 105.2900 Japanese yen)	-0.4347070075
DETROIT (Reuters) - The technology underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin is migrating to the auto industry and vehicle sharing.Accounting and consulting firm EY, part of Ernst &amp; Young Global Ltd, said on Wednesday it was launching a blockchain based system that will enable companies or groups of individuals to more easily share ownership of vehicles and access to cars and trucks. EY could deploy the system, called Tesseract, in a test with an unnamed partner within the next quarter, EY partner John Simlett told Reuters in an interview.The concept of sharing the use of vehicles is not new to the auto industry, but the use of blockchain technology to record vehicle ownership, log the use of vehicles, and apportion insurance costs and other transactions is in its infancy.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, for example, said in May that its Toyota Research Institute would work with researchers at MIT and technology partners including BigchainDB of Berlin, Oaken Innovations of Dallas and Toronto and Commuterz, an Israeli startup, to develop blockchain based applications. Toyota said it was also working with partners to develop usage-based insurance products using blockchain systems.EY’s Simlett said blockchain systems could enable shared use and shared ownership of large fleets of vehicles, such as a group of cars parked in a high-rise building that residents could use as needed, gaining access using a smartphone app.Blockchain technology allows shared access to data that is maintained by a network of computers, instead of a trusted third party.A group of 10 large food and retail companies earlier this month said they had joined an IBM IBM.N effort to study how blockchain systems could be applied to food supply chains.Microsoft Corp MSFT.O also recently said it was developing what it called the CoCo framework to reduce the complexity of adapting blockchain technology to commercial transactions. Financial services companies and securities exchanges are also exploring uses for blockchain technology. The venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O in June was among the leaders in funding a London startup, Blockchain, that makes software to allow consumers and businesses to use digital currencies such as bitcoin.	5.602761551
DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Monday reported a fourth consecutive month of lower U.S. new vehicle sales for June and came in below analyst expectations, despite hefty consumer discounts and looser loan terms, providing fresh evidence that 2017 will fall short of last year’s record year for the industry.Automakers' shares rose, however, as retail sales to consumers were relatively stable at the U.S. automakers, with General Motors Co GM.N asserting that the industry was set for a stronger finish to the year. Industry consultant Autodata put the industry’s seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales at 16.51 million units, which was the lowest rate since February 2015. It came in below Wall Street expectations of 16.6 million vehicles and 2 percent lower than the June 2016 figure.U.S. consumers continued to shun passenger cars in favor of larger pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. Passenger car sales were also hurt as some automakers, including GM, have moved to reduce relatively low-margin sales to rental agencies.The U.S. auto industry has been bracing for a downturn after hitting a record 17.55 million new vehicles sold in 2016. A glut of nearly new used vehicles poses competition for new vehicle sales and automakers have relied increasingly on consumer discounts and loosened lending terms.Car shopping website Edmunds said the average length of a car loan reached a record high of 69.3 months in June.“It’s financially risky, leaving borrowers exposed to being upside down on their vehicles for a large chunk of their loans,�� said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds�� executive director of industry analysis.GM said its sales fell about 5 percent versus June 2016, but that the industry would see stronger sales in the second half of 2017 versus the first half.“U.S. total sales are moderating due to an industry-wide pullback in daily rental sales, but key U.S. economic fundamentals clearly remain positive,�� said GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem. “Under the current economic conditions, we anticipate U.S. retail vehicle sales will remain strong for the foreseeable future.”Ford Motor Co F.N said its June sales were hit by lower fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities, which fell 13.9 percent, while sales to consumers were flat.Wall Street analysts worry that the millions of low mileage, off-lease vehicles poised to hit the market between now and the end of 2019 will weigh on future new vehicle sales.Ford vice president for U.S. marketing, sales and service Mark LaNeve said on a conference call that the automaker has seen little evidence that its competitors are reducing their reliance on leasing to clinch a sale.GM shares added 1.8 percent on Monday, while Ford shares rose 3.3 percent.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCAU.N said June sales decreased 7 percent versus the same month a year earlier. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said sales rose 2.1 percent versus June 2016 and said it saw strong gains in the RAV4, a light SUV, sales of which increased 24.7 percent. Sales of another SUV, the 4Runner, rose 16.6 percent. But sales at Toyota’s Lexus luxury car brand fell 5.4 percent on the year.Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T said its U.S. sales increased 2 percent. But while truck, SUV and crossover sales jumped 19.5 percent, sedan sales dropped 12.1 percent. In the past few years, Americans have increasingly shunned smaller passenger cars in favor of larger vehicles.Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T said sales for June were up 0.8 percent.	3.869897724

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is snubbing Congress by refusing to turn over a report detailing an investigation into national security risks potentially posed by imported vehicles and auto parts, citing pending international negotiations and executive branch deliberations.Congress inserted a provision in a spending bill last month demanding the White House turn over the long-secret government report that U.S. President Donald Trump used to declare in May 2019 that some unnamed imported autos pose risks to national security.Trump opted not to impose any immediate tariffs on imported cars or auto parts because of the alleged security threat and then ordered another six-month review on a decision on tariffs of up to 25%.The delay was to allow for more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan.A person briefed on the matter said Trump had relied on a Justice Department opinion to order Commerce not to turn over the report under a Section 232 investigation.The Commerce Department said in a statement it was “not releasing the 232 autos report because releasing it now would interfere with the President’s ability to protect confidential executive branch communications and could interfere with ongoing negotiations.”Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, blasted the decision saying “by refusing to make public the statutorily-required report on automobile tariffs, the Department of Commerce is willfully violating federal law.�� Toomey said he was “evaluating the potential for corrective action to compel the rightful release of this report.”On Tuesday, Trump said he was still considering imposing tariffs and mentioned imported European vehicles in particular, without singling out any brands.“We expect to be able to make a deal with Europe. And if they don’t make a deal, we’ll certainly give that very strong consideration,�� Trump said. “But if we’re unable to make a deal, we will have to do something.”The Justice Department opinion, seen by Reuters before it was and made public on Tuesday, said Trump was justified in “withholding the report until the resolution of diplomatic negotiations�� and any subsequent action. It said he could “rely on the constitutional doctrine of executive privilege to decline to release the report.”A spokesman for Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said the Justice Department memo “doesn’t seem to have much merit on its face. The law as passed by Congress is clear.”The White House declined comment.Some U.S. lawmakers want to restrict presidential authority to invoke the tariffs on national security grounds.In May, Trump said he agreed with the undisclosed report’s finding that found some imported cars and trucks were “weakening our internal economy�� and threatened to harm U.S. national security.But automakers have warned tariffs would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.An ad hoc group called ""Here for America"" representing major German and Asian automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Nissan Motor Co, said ""there is no compelling reason not to disclose this report to the public, or to restrict trade in an industry that supports the jobs of millions of Americans.""It previously called the national security designation “absurd.��"	-1.780163888
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE diesel emissions test rigging scandal could accelerate a shift toward gasoline-electric hybrid cars and plug-in electric hybrids - even as cheaper gasoline, for now, saps demand for green cars.The fallout from VW - where the cost of the scandal pushed the German automaker to a first quarterly loss in at least 15 years - is rippling through an industry already embracing alternative ‘greener�� propulsion systems to traditional gasoline and diesel.Diesel technology, which had been seen, especially among European carmakers, as a mainstream solution to helping the industry meet tougher fuel economy and emissions regulations, now looks vulnerable - though it’s far from finished.“Anybody can, with certainty, guess what’s going to happen ... This (VW) scandal is not going to make diesel more popular in the United States. This scandal is not going to make diesel more popular in Japan,�� Nissan Motor CEO Carlos Ghosn told reporters on Wednesday on the opening day of the Tokyo Motor Show.With diesel potentially falling out of favor, automakers and their technology suppliers will likely turn to non-diesel solutions in a stricter regulatory environment.Over the next five years and beyond, auto industry officials see hybrid technology - especially heavily electrified plug-in hybrid know-how - emerging more into the mainstream. Volkswagen itself is now looking closer at long-range plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles as it seeks to put the scandal behind it.“If you take out diesel as a key solution ..., initially conventional hybrid technology, and then plug-in hybrids, will have to be used to fill the gap,�� said a person close to AVL, a privately-owned global powertrain specialist. “Beyond 2020, hydrogen fuel-cell cars will have to play a greater role.”That would go down well in Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing for a so-called ‘hydrogen society��, with the zero-emission fuel powering homes and cars.Honda Motor operating officer Toshihiro Mibe says hydrogen fuel-cell cars - including the company’s first mass market model unveiled at the Tokyo show on Wednesday - are quietly gaining momentum.“Beyond 2020, we think diesel is not going to play a role at all in meeting fuel economy and emissions regulations,�� he told Reuters. “Electrification is costly technology to pursue, but manufacturing costs ... are coming down fast and we will hit a point soon where costs for electrified cars will be cheaper than for diesel cars.”Any broader shift to plug-in hybrid technology will likely benefit automakers like Toyota Motor and General Motors, which are already up and running with plug-in hybrids, such as the Prius variant and Chevrolet Volt on the market.“We believe hybrid cars�� competitiveness might gain a lot more steam as a consequence of the VW scandal,�� a senior Toyota executive told Reuters. “People who bought VW diesel cars in the U.S. are highly environmentally conscious. We hope (they) would switch to hybrids when they replace their diesel cars.”Similarly, as consumers turn to tried and trusted models, electrification parts suppliers such as Denso, Aisin, Bosch [ROBG.UL], Valeo, Delphi [DCLC.UL], LG Electronics, Panasonic, Continental and Visteon stand to gain business.All-electric battery cars will likely be less prominent, industry experts say, because of their limited driving range and cumbersome re-charging.In the shorter term, to meet regulatory requirements through to around 2018, conventional gas-electric hybrids, as opposed to plug-ins, should prove highly useful, experts added, as will be other fuel-saving technologies such as turbo-charging and ignition shut-on-and-off systems.“Shorter run, we would see a continued downsizing of gasoline engines using turbo charging. We would also see more direct injection of fuel, more 3-cylinder and even 2-cylinder engines ...,�� the person close to AVL said.But, with so much invested in capacity to produce diesel engines, industry executives aren’t writing off the technology just yet.“We still believe in the future of diesel engines because they are in the trade-off of emissions and CO2, they are a very good option for many vehicles,�� VW brand CEO Herbert Diess told reporters at the Tokyo show.Koei Saga, Toyota senior managing officer for powertrain technology, reckons diesel technology still has a role to play, especially in powering cars and trucks sold in emerging markets in Asia, South America and Africa, where affordability and fuel economy are key.As regulations and testing methods become more stringent in developed markets, diesel technology would have to advance significantly, making it as expensive to make diesel-fuelled cars as gasoline-electric hybrids.“It’s hard to see diesel becoming a mainstream solution,�� Saga told Reuters.	0.9574813372

MARTINSVILLE, Va. -- With surgical efficiency, Joey Logano continued his domination of knockout qualifying at Martinsville Speedway.Saving his car and his tires for the final round of Saturday’s time trials at the .526-mile short track, Logano won the pole for Sunday’s STP 500 (2 p.m. ET on FS1, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio) with a lap at 97.830 mph (19.356 seconds).Driving the No. 22 Team Penske Ford, Logano edged Stewart-Haas Racing Ford driver Aric Almirola (97.643 mph) for the top starting spot by .037 seconds. Brad Keselowski (97.458 mph) qualified third, followed by Kevin Harvick (97.382 mph), as Ford drivers captured the top four positions on the grid.The Busch Pole Award was Logano’s first of the season, his fifth at Martinsville and the 21st of his career. Logano ran only three laps total in the first two rounds, allowing him to save his tires for a four-lap run in the final round. His last lap was his fastest.“It’s awesome to get another pole and hopefully we can top it off with another win,�� said Logano, who used a victory in last year’s Playoff race at Martinsville as a springboard to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship. “This is a fun race. I always look forward to coming up here.”Logano has earned his five of the last seven contested poles at Martinsville over a nine-race span, with two of the qualifying sessions canceled because of adverse weather.All told, Fords claimed six of the top 12 starting positions, including Team Penske drivers Logano and Keselowski and all four Stewart-Haas Racing drivers -- Almirola, Harvick, Daniel Suarez (10th) and Clint Bowyer (11th). In contrast to Logano’s economical runs, Bowyer had 16 laps on his tires at the end of the final round.Five-time Martinsville winner Denny Hamlin paced the first two rounds but had to settle for fifth when the starting order for the top 12 drivers was decided. Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. (ninth) were the only Toyota drivers to make the final round.William Byron was sixth fastest in the money round to lead four Chevrolets in the final 12. He was joined by Chip Ganassi Racing’s Kyle Larson (seventh) and fellow Hendrick Motorsports drivers Chase Elliott (eighth) and Jimmie Johnson (12th), who leads active drivers with nine victories at the paper-clip-shaped track.Trying for his third straight Cup win on Sunday -- not to mention a weekend sweep of the Martinsville races -- Saturday’s NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series victor Kyle Busch will start 14th in the STP 500.“Too loose. Just didn’t have it with track conditions today,�� said Busch, who opted not to make a mock qualifying run during practice.For Byron, the sixth-place run was a welcome end to a frustrating day. Early in Saturday’s opening practice, his No. 24 Chevrolet bounced off the outside wall. His crew spent the rest of the session -- and then some -- repairing the car.“I’m kind of optimistic, but we’ve had a rough day,�� Byron said after qualifying. “These two-day shows are tough, and we started out with a flat right front (tire) and hit the wall. Then in second practice, we were way behind because we didn’t have enough practice time.“The guys made a lot of great changes to get it right going into qualifying. We were really struggling over the bumps over both ends, really, and getting on the concrete (in the corners). We’ll see what happens -- should be fun.”Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Qualifying -- 70th Annual STP 500Martinsville SpeedwayMartinsville, Virginia1. (22) Joey Logano, Ford, 97.830 mph.2.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese companies agreed on Wednesday to raise wages for a fifth year but many are expected to fall short of meeting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s 3 percent goal, adding to doubts the central bank will be able to hit its inflation target.The results of the “shunto�� spring wage negotiations between corporate management and unions, announced by the big automobile and electronics companies, set the tone for wage hikes across the nation and could give hints about future consumer spending.Abe has been campaigning for a 3 percent gain to spur consumption and banish the deflation that has dogged Japan’s economy for nearly two decades.Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has also urged a similar increase to nudge up inflation to the BOJ’s long elusive 2 percent target.Wage growth is expected to accelerate given bigger bonuses, and rising pay at small firms and for part timers. Still, it won’t reach Abe’s target or be strong enough to clear hurdles for the central bank to start scaling back its massive stimulus program, some analysts say.“The Bank of Japan won’t move this year. It will probably wait to see results of next year’s shunto,�� said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.Even though many Japanese firms are sitting on piles of cash from healthy earnings, and the country’s labor market is increasingly tight, companies are wary of boosting base salaries because that commits them to higher fixed personnel costs. Instead, they prefer one-off bonuses and other benefits.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, considered a bellwether in the country's annual wage negotiations, agreed to raise monthly base salaries by more than 1,300 yen ($12.18) for the coming year, more than last year but below the union's demand for 3,000 yen.Including increases in base salary for full-time employees and pay for contract workers, Japan’s largest automaker said that overall monthly payment for all union members would increase by an average 3.3 percent.Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Hitachi Ltd 6501.T said they would raise annual salaries -- including bonuses and other benefits -- by more than 3 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively.“We have agreed to the increase as we would like to contribute to the country’s economic development and its manufacturing culture,�� Toyota senior managing officer Tatsuro Ueda told reporters in Toyota City, central Japan.Over the past four years, major companies agreed to raise wages about 2 percent each spring. The bulk of that - about 1.8 percentage points - comes automatically under Japan’s seniority-based employment system. Anything beyond that is a hike in “base pay.”Several economists have forecast major companies would agree to base pay hikes of 0.5-0.6 percent, which with the seniority-based automatic salary rise would bring wage growth in the vicinity of 2015’s 2.38 percent rise, which was a 17-year high.“Wage hikes are regaining momentum, but they are still shy of reaching 3 percent at most companies,�� said Hisashi Yamada, director at Japan Research Institute.“I doubt companies can sustain wage hikes without government pressure. They must steadily raise wages on their own initiative to revamp business structure and improve their ability to grow.”Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he expects the tide of wage hikes reflecting better corporate earnings will spread to non-regular workers and small firms so that deflation will end.“We will strive to achieve virtuous cycle of growth and distribution through work-style reform,�� Suga told reporters.However, wage gains could be offset by cuts in overtime pay as companies come under pressure from the government to curb Japan’s notoriously long overtime hours.Rises in deductions for social security to service the rapidly aging population could also cut into wage gains, analysts say.Japan’s unions tend not to be as aggressive in pressing their demands as those in the West because they attach greater importance to job security and maintain a sense of corporate loyalty.	-1.130769231
* $3.7 bln industry moves 15 million people a day* Taxis sprang up informally during apartheid era* Market dominated by Toyota vehicles* Nissan returns to taxi market after 18-year hiatusBy David DolanSOWETO, South Africa, March 10 (Reuters) - Zakes Hadebe’s minibus taxi has nearly half a million kilometres on the clock, a broken speedometer and a fuel gauge he struggles to keep just above empty.Yet by 8 a.m. on a recent Friday, Hadebe and his rattling Toyota had already overcome rain, traffic and an ever-rising petrol price to ferry nearly 40 commuters from South Africa’s black township of Soweto to nearby Johannesburg.South Africa’s minibus taxi industry, scorned by other motorists for reckless driving and dogged by a reputation for violence, moves 15 million people every day, most of them lower income blacks. More like buses than the taxis of New York or London, the rumbling 16-seaters are the wheels of Africa’s largest economy.With an annual revenue estimated at $3.7 billion, the industry is also drawing attention from local finance firms and global automakers. Nissan this month started selling taxis in South Africa after an 18-year hiatus, looking to challenge Toyota’s dominance.“If the taxi industry were to stop completely, there’s no cleaner at your house, there’s no coffee at work, there’s no workers on the work floor,�� said Nkululeko Buthelezi, chief executive of the South African National Taxi Council industry body.The industry sprang up during white-minority rule, when blacks had to live in townships miles away from the cities where they worked and where bus service was spotty.Since the end of apartheid in 1994, taxis have grown into arguably South Africa’s largest black-owned sector, with around 250,000 vehicles and directly employing 600,000.While the average owner has 2-1/2 vehicles and employs drivers, some, like Hadebe, do the driving themselves.“The petrol is the biggest problem,�� said the 33-year-old, whose daily revenue is at the bottom end of the industry average of 1,000 to 2,500 rand ($93-$230), and that’s before paying for fuel.“You have to make use of each and every cent that you get.”The sound and spectacle of the often battered and barely roadworthy taxis are impossible to miss; drivers persistently bleat their horns to attract passengers, who use an elaborate system of hand signals to indicate destinations.A single finger pointing up will flag a taxi headed into central Johannesburg, while four fingers indicate the suburb of Fourways. The city of Johannesburg has even published a guide to hand signals.Drivers stop for passengers without warning, and their recklessness, combined with shoddy maintenance, make for deadly road accidents. In 2010 police arrested a man who was driving drunk with 49 children in a taxi meant for 16.The national taxi council last year started an academy for customer care and driving skills. It also aims to formalise hiring by registering drivers and promoting a code of conduct.To improve road safety, the government offers owners a subsidy to scrap old taxis and buy new ones, but uptake is slow as the grant covers just a fifth of the cost of a new Toyota.The industry has yet to stamp out the mafia-style violence that flares up when rival owners battle for routes. Last month the chairman of one Johannesburg taxi group was gunned down in what police said was probably a planned execution.Taxi violence claimed at least 140 lives in 2011, according to one study, down from 258 in 1999, when townships were scorched by waves of “taxi wars��.Still, that’s enough to rival the deadly political infighting of South Africa’s mining industry.Buthelezi said the taxi council had brought down violence, but admitted more needed to be done. A “huge percentage�� of drivers still carry guns, he said.“It has been a violent industry, so people develop certain protection mechanisms.”The industry’s wider economic impact is in plain view on a visit to one of the thousands of bustling taxi ranks that dot cities and townships across the country, where commuters queue for a lift or to transfer between routes.Besides those employed at the ranks, such as queue organisers, scores more flock to it to make their living. There are women serving meals by the roadside, hawkers selling drinks and clothing, and makeshift barbers offering a “cheese kop��, or head shave.Though taxis are better regulated than during apartheid, finance remains a major hurdle for owners.“Most of the people who come to us cannot access funding from the traditional institutions,�� said Terry Kier, the chief executive of SA Taxi, the taxi financing unit of Johannesburg-listed Transaction Capital.“They are very astute businessmen. They’ve got very deep insight into their cash flows.”SA Taxi finances 23,000 vehicles, all of which are equipped with tracking devices, giving it data into the profitability of routes and individual owners. That helps it build a better profile of the business than a simple credit history of the owner, Kier said.The company uses the data to sell localised advertising space in taxis; the opening of a shop, for example, can be advertised on routes in the immediate area.Around 1,200 new taxis are sold every month in South Africa, about 80 percent of them Toyotas.Nissan, a major player until a regulatory change in 1996 prompted it to abandon the market, is aiming to sell up to 400 a month of its new NV350. The NV350 starts at 307,000 rand ($28,600), just under the 312,100 rand for Toyota’s Quantum.So far Toyota has been able to fend off rivals. Chinese automakers tried to muscle in, but their low-priced vehicles haven’t been able to take the punishment, owners say.Toyota also has a long track record with the industry, helping it win legal recognition from the apartheid government in the 1980s, which sought to keep blacks from driving cabs.An early Toyota taxi model was known as a “Zola Budd�� in the townships, said Johan van Zyl, Toyota’s head for Africa, after the 1980s South African distance runner famous for her speed and endurance.Taxi owners have a similar resilience.“It’s a bunch of people who had to struggle to establish an industry by themselves,�� van Zyl said. “They financed themselves, they created their own industry and their own rules and regulations.��	-8.06508981
15. Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen aus der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus:USA/DAIMLER - Der Autobauer wird in seinem US-Werk in Alabama in der kommenden Woche nichts produzieren können. Grund seien fehlende Zuliefer-Teile, erklärte der Konzern am Freitag. Insidern zufolge liegt das an fehlenden Teilen aus Mexiko, wo die Zulieferer ihre Produktion noch nicht wieder aufgenommen haben. Daimler hatte das Werk Ende April nach der Corona-Krise wieder hochgefahren.FACEBOOK - Das Online-Netzwerk kauft das US-Unternehmen Giphy, das auf animierte Bilder (GIFs) im Netz spezialisiert ist. Giphy solle Teil der Facebook-Tochter Instagram werden, teilte der Konzern am Freitag mit. Finanzielle Details des Vorhabens wurden nicht genannt. Der Nachrichtendienst Axios sprach allerdings von etwa 400 Millionen Dollar, die als Kaufpreis im Raum stünden.FRESENIUS - Frankfurt: Der Gesundheitskonzern rechnet im Zusammenhang mit der Virus-Krise mit keinen größeren Einbußen. “Insgesamt bleibe ich dabei: Die eine oder andere Schramme werden wir noch abbekommen��, sagte Konzernchef Stephan Sturm der “FAZ�� laut Vorabbericht. “Größere finanzielle Einbußen sollten uns aber erspart bleiben. Wir werden diese Krise gut meistern.�� In China sehe er mittlerweile eine weitgehende Normalisierung. “In unseren Werken produzieren wir wieder voll. Auch die Logistik innerhalb des Landes hat sehr zügig Fortschritte gemacht.�� In Amerika, wo Fresenius mit der Tochter Fresenius Medical Care stark vertreten ist, sieht er positive Anzeichen. “Inzwischen ist meine Wahrnehmung, dass wir auch in den USA den Scheitelpunkt überschritten haben und darauf hoffen können, dass wir graduell hin zu einer Normalisierung kommen.”VIRGIN ATLANTIC - London: Die Pläne der britischen Regierung, im Land ankommende Reisende mit einer Quarantäne von 14 Tagen zu belegen, erschweren die Lage bei der Airline weiter. Sollte das Vorhaben umgesetzt werden, halte dies Fluggäste fern und Virgin werde frühestens im August den Flugbetrieb wieder aufnehmen, sagte ein Insider aus dem Umfeld des Unternehmens. Ohne Quarantäne könne vielleicht schon im Juli wieder geflogen werden. Der britische Virgin-Besitzer Richard Branson hat - wie viele andere Fluggesellschaften auch - Staatshilfe beantragt, um die Coronakrise mit ihren Reisebeschränkungen zu überstehen.FIAT CHRYSLER - Mailand: Der Autobauer bemüht sich angesichts der Coronakrise einem Insider zufolge um eine milliardenschwere Staatsbürgschaft. Das Unternehmen spreche mit der italienischen Großbank Intesa Sanpaolo über einen vom Staat garantierten Kredit im Volumen von 6,3 Milliarden Euro, sagte eine mit dem Vorgang vertraute Person Reuters. Fiat Chrysler und die Bank lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab.VF CORP - Bangalore: Der US-Hersteller von Vans-Schuhen und Timberland-Stiefeln rechnet wegen der durch das Coronavirus verursachten Ladenschließungen im laufenden Quartal mit Umsatzeinbußen von mehr als der Hälfte. “In den ersten zehn Monaten des Fiskaljahres 2019/2020 hat unser Unternehmen Ergebnisse erzielt, die über unseren langfristigen Wachstumszielen liegen. Dann veränderte sich die Welt für uns alle wegen COVID-19��, sagte VF-Corp-Chef Steve Rendle. Davon seien auch die Lieferanten betroffen, ferner würden viele Werke mit reduzierter Kapazität arbeiten. Für das im März beendete vierte Quartal des Geschäftsjahres 2019/20 meldete das in Denver, Colorado, ansässige Unternehmen einen Nettoverlust von 483,8 Millionen Dollar, verglichen mit einem Gewinn von 128,8 Millionen Dollar im Vorjahreszeitraum. Der Nettoumsatz sank um etwa zwei Prozent auf 2,1 Milliarden Dollar und lag damit unter den Analysten-Schätzung von 2,28 Milliarden Dollar. VF-Corp gab keinen Ausblick auf das aktuelle Geschäftsjahr 2020/2021.TOYOTA - Tokio: Der japanische Autobauer plant wegen der Coronavirus-Krise seine heimische Produktion im Juni zu reduzieren. Wegen der geringeren Nachfrage nach Neuwagen werde der Konzern nun 122.000 Einheiten weniger herstellen, teilte Toyota mit. Dies entspreche einer 40-prozentigen Kürzung gegenüber den bisherigen Prognosen für den Monat Juni.BMW - München: Der Autobauer beginnt mit der angekündigten Herstellung von Atemschutzmasken in Deutschland. Zwei vollautomatische Anlagen produzieren im Werk Wackersdorf bei Regensburg täglich insgesamt bis zu 200.000 Mund-Nase-Masken, mit denen sich BMW-Mitarbeiter vor dem Coronavirus schützen sollen. Spezialmaschinen und Rohmaterial stammen ebenfalls aus Bayern. Die Maschinen lieferte der zum chinesischen Autozulieferer Ningbo Joyson Electronic gehörende deutsche Hersteller PIA Automation. Vliesstoffe kommen vom bayerischen Textilkonzern Sandler. Die Bundesregierung will die heimische Produktion von Masken und weiterer medizinischer Ausrüstung ankurbeln.OTTOBOCK �� Danzig: Das Medizintechnikunternehmen hat im vergangenen Jahr erstmals einen Jahresumsatz von mehr als einer Milliarde Euro erzielt. Der Umsatz kletterte 2019 um 8,2 Prozent auf 1,003 Milliarden Euro, wie Ottobock mitteilte. Der bereinigte operative Gewinn (Ebitda) stieg um zehn Prozent auf 191 Millionen Euro. Damit verbesserte sich die Ebitda-Marge auf 19,2 Prozent. “Im nächsten Schritt wollen wir ein Niveau von 20 Prozent erreichen��, sagte Finanzchef Jörg Wahlers. Für 2020 habe Ottobock das Wachstumstempo eigentlich steigern wollen, doch die Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise auf die Geschäftszahlen seien noch nicht abschätzbar, sagte Firmenchef Philipp Schulte-Noelle. “In den ersten Monaten waren wir voll auf Kurs, diese Ziele zu erreichen.�� Sobald sich die Situation normalisiert habe, rechne das Unternehmen mit Nachholeffekten.FOXCONN - Taipeh: Der Gewinn des taiwanischen Elektronikherstellers ist im ersten Quartal um fast 90 Prozent eingebrochen. Der Nettogewinn von Foxconn - früher Hon Hai Precision - rutschte auf 2,1 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar (rund 65 Millionen Euro), da die Corona-Pandemie die Nachfrage von Apple und anderen Großkunden drückte, wie Foxconn mitteilte. Dies liegt deutlich unter den Analystenschätzungen von 8,88 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar. Der Konzern erwartet jedoch ein zweistelliges Umsatzwachstum im zweiten Quartal, da die Produktion in China wieder hochgefahren ist. “Hon Hai wird sich im zweiten Quartal stabilisieren��, erklärte der Konzern.FORTUM/UNIPER - Helsinki: Der finnische Energieversorger Fortum hat im ersten Quartal weniger verdient. Der operative Gewinn schrumpfte um vier Prozent auf 393 Millionen Euro, lag damit aber noch über den Erwartungen der Analysten. Der Mehrheitseigentümer des Düsseldorfer Versorgers Uniper konnte Einbußen durch niedrigere Strompreise weitgehend durch Absicherungsgeschäfte ausgleichen. Fortum bekräftigte, im Laufe des Jahres mit Uniper eine gemeinsame Strategie zu entwickeln.WÜSTENROT &amp; WÜRTTEMBERGISCHE (W&amp;W) - München: Der Gewinn des Bauspar- und Versicherungskonzerns ist wegen des Abschwungs an den Kapitalmärkten in der Coronakrise im ersten Quartal um zwei Drittel eingebrochen. Das Nettoergebnis sei auf 25,0 (78,5) Millionen Euro gesunken, teilte W&amp;W mit. Grund dafür war ein negatives Finanzergebnis. Die Pandemie zeigte sich vor allem bei der Bausparkasse Wüstenrot, deren Brutto-Neugeschäft um 13 Prozent einbrach. Damit habe sie aber noch Marktanteile gewonnen, erklärte W&amp;W. Die Gewinnprognose für 2020 hatte der Konzern bereits Anfang Mai gekappt.CATHAY PACIFIC - Sydney: Die Fluggesellschaft bezeichnet ihre Aussichten wegen der Coronavirus-Pandemie als “sehr düster��. Die Passagierzahlen von Cathay Pacific brachen im April um 99,6 Prozent ein. “Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt sehen wir noch keine unmittelbaren Anzeichen für eine Verbesserung��, sagte Ronald Lam, Manager bei Cathay Pacific. Das Hongkonger Unternehmen verbuchte im Zeitraum Januar bis April einen ungeprüften Verlust von 4,5 Milliarden Hongkong-Dollar (537,1 Millionen Euro).GEA - Düsseldorf: Der für die Nahrungsmittel- und Getränkeindustrie produzierende Anlagenbauer hat bislang keine größeren Auswirkungen der Coronakrise zu spüren bekommen. So stieg der Auftragseingang um 16 Prozent auf 1,38 Milliarden Euro und markierte damit eine Bestmarke für ein erstes Quartal. Bei einem Umsatzplus um 3,5 Prozent auf 1,09 Milliarden Euro stieg das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) vor Restrukturierungsaufwand um 40,7 Prozent auf 105 Millionen Euro. “Gea ist sehr gut in das Geschäftsjahr 2020 gestartet. Auch wenn die Dauer und damit die finanziellen Auswirkungen von Covid-19 nur schwer abzuschätzen sind, halten wir an unserem Ausblick für 2020 fest��, betonte Vorstandschef Stefan Klebert.AURUBIS - Düsseldorf: Der Kupferkonzern ist dank gestiegener Preise im ersten Halbjahr des Bilanzjahres 2019/20 trotz der Coronakrise noch glimpflich davon gekommen. Bei einem Umsatzanstieg auf 6,013 (Vorjahr: 5,7) Milliarden Euro schrumpfte das Vorsteuerergebnis auf 91 (103) Millionen Euro. “Angesichts der Covid-19-Pandemie haben wir Aurubis bisher gut durch die Krise gesteuert��, erklärte Vorstandschef Roland Harings. Er bekräftigte daher seine Jahresziele.VARTA - Düsseldorf: Wegen der hohen Nachfrage nach Lithium-Ionen-Zellen und dank eines Zukaufs ist der schwäbische Batteriehersteller mit deutlichen Zuwächsen ins Jahr gestartet. Der Umsatz schnellte um rund 170 Prozent auf 198,5 Millionen Euro, ohne Akquisitionen hätte der Zuwachs bei 68,2 Prozent gelegen. Das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) stieg in den ersten drei Monaten um 197 Prozent auf 51,7 Millionen Euro, bereinigt um 135 Prozent. Der Vorstand bekräftigte seine Prognose für 2020, die einen Umsatz zwischen 780 und 800 Millionen Euro vorsieht, ein Wachstum zwischen 115 und 120 Prozent.OFFICE DEPOT - Bangalore: Der US-Büroartikelhersteller kündigt die Streichung von rund 13.100 Arbeitsplätzen und die Schließung von Filialen an. Die Maßnahmen sollen bis Ende 2023 umgesetzt werden und zu Nettoeinsparungen von 860 Millionen Dollar führen, wie das Management bekanntgab. Zugleich werden durch den Abbau Belastungen von bis zu 543 Millionen Dollar erwartet. Office Depot will sich künftig stärker auf sein Geschäft mit IT-Dienstleistungen konzentrieren.OMV - Wien: Beim Wiener Erdöl- und Gaskonzern werden die Reiseausgaben von Vorstandschef Rainer Seele und die Sponsoring-Aktivitäten des Unternehmens unter die Lupe genommen. Eine entsprechende Prüfung ordnete der Aufsichtsrat an, wie dessen Vorsitzender Wolfgang Berndt mitteilte. Hintergrund ist ein Bericht der Onlineplattform dossier.at. Diesem zufolge zahlte OMV für Seeles Nutzung von Privatflugzeugen seit 2016 insgesamt 400.000 Euro. Die Sponsorenvereinbarung mit dem Fußballclub Zenit St. Petersburg, dem angeblichen Lieblingsteam des russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin, habe 25 Millionen Euro gekostet. Aufsichtsratschef Berndt sagte der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters, Seeles und seine eigenen Reiseausgaben von 2017 bis 2019 würden untersucht. Das gelte auch für alle Sponsoringausgaben.NIKE - Bangalore: Der US-Sportartikelhersteller erwartet eine Belastung der Finanzergebnisse im laufenden Geschäftsquartal durch die coronabedingten Filialschließungen rund um den Globus. Das teilte der Adidas- und Puma-Konkurrent am Donnerstag nach US-Börsenschluss mit. Nike fährt zwar sein E-Commerce-Geschäft hoch, um die gestiegenen Internetbestellungen stemmen zu können. Aber je nach Land sind nach Angaben des Managements derzeit nur fünf bis 40 Prozent der Nike-Filialen offen. In mehr als 15 Ländern hat das Unternehmen nach den Schließungen im Zuge der Viruskrise wieder Geschäfte geöffnet, darunter Deutschland, Frankreich, Brasilien und die USA.

(Reuters) - A former executive of Japanese auto parts maker T.RAD Co Ltd was indicted on Thursday on one charge of fixing the prices of radiators sold to car makers, the Justice Department said.Michitaka Sakuma, former executive managing director of T.RAD, was accused of coordinating with other auto parts makers to illegally set the prices of radiators sold to Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp, the department said.Sakuma, a member of the company’s board of directors, was a general manager for T.RAD in charge of Toyota sales but rose to executive managing director for all sales, according to an indictment filed in federal court.He is the second T.RAD executive to face criminal charges.T.RAD is among 35 companies which have pleaded guilty to fixing the prices of dozens of car parts. A total of 53 executives have been charged with price-fixing or rigging bids of auto parts in the long-running probe.The case is United States of America v. Michitaka Sakuma. It is filed at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is case No. 15-20290.	-2.769606085
TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Subaru cars maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd said on Friday it would stop manufacturing Toyota Motor Corp’s Camry at its Indiana plant in the autumn of 2016.In a separate statement, Toyota said it would shift the production of the Camry that is now being manufactured at Fuji Heavy’s Indiana plant to its own Kentucky plant in the autumn of 2016.Late last year, Fuji Heavy had said it received notice that Toyota may cease production of the Camry at the Indiana plant in 2017.Toyota owns 16.5 percent of Fuji Heavy.

(Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators on Thursday announced a proposal that would require brake override systems on all new passenger cars and trucks, likely by the 2015 model year.The U.S. Department of Transportation safety regulation arm in a 98-page proposal said costs to auto manufacturers are expected to be “close to zero�� because most automakers already install brake override systems that can stop a vehicle if the accelerator pedal gets stuck open.“Almost all�� 2012 model year automobiles sold in the United States are equipped with brake-throttle override systems, according to a notice on the proposed rule change by the DOT’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.If the proposed rule passes a 60-day comment period and becomes a final rule by October 1, the brake-throttle override requirement would go into effect on September 1, 2014, NHTSA said.“The NHTSA proposal aims to minimize the risk that drivers will lose control of their vehicles as a result of either accelerator control system disconnections or accelerator pedal sticking or floor mat entrapment,�� said a NHTSA press statement.DOT Secretary Ray LaHood said in the same statement, “By updating our safety standards, we’re helping give drivers peace of mind that their brakes will work even if the gas pedal is stuck down while the driver is trying to brake.”Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of autos and sales analyst Edmunds.com, was critical of the proposed rule.“There’s the risk that an override system could provide a false sense of security for drivers, especially in cases where a driver accidentally applies the wrong pedal, and an override will do nothing to solve the problem,�� said Anwyl.“While this mandate might help prevent some other causes of sudden unintended acceleration, a brake override system could impact everyday drivability and generate other sorts of customer complaints if not executed properly,�� he said.The proposal comes after much-publicized unintended acceleration claims made against some Toyota Motor Corp models, which caused a worldwide recall of nearly 19 million vehicles from late 2009 to early 2011.Toyota maintained from the start of its worst safety crisis that the issue was linked to floormats pinning gas pedals down rather than a systemic electronic problem. And in early 2011, LaHood announced that a federal probe essentially agreed with Toyota.“There is no electronic-based cause for unintended high-speed acceleration in Toyotas,�� LaHood said in February 2011.Once the proposed rule change is published in the Federal Register, the public can comment on it. Here is a draft of the proposal: here.	-2.11250307
MILAN (Reuters) - The boards of French carmaker PSA PEUP.PA, the owner of Peugeot, and Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI (FCA) in separate meetings on Tuesday approved a binding agreement for a $50 billion merger, sources said. The two mid-sized carmakers announced plans six weeks ago for a tie-up to create the world’s No. 4 carmaker and reshape the global industry. A merger is seen helping them deal with big challenges in the industry, including a global downturn in demand and the need to develop costly cleaner cars to meet looming anti-pollution rules.Both companies declined to comment.A source close to FCA had said earlier the two companies could formally announce the agreement early on Wednesday, followed by a conference call to explain further details later in the day.China's Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd 0489.HK, which now has a 12.2% equity stake in PSA, will have a reduced stake of around 4.5% in the merged group, two sources said, in a move that could help make regulatory approval easier.According to the deal approved by PSA’s board on Tuesday, FCA’s robot unit, Comau, will remain within the combined group rather than be spun off as was originally planned in October, the sources said.The new group will evaluate how to extract value from Comau.Ahead of the meetings, entities representing the Peugeot family, Etablissements Peugeot Freres (EPF) and FFP, unanimously approved a proposed memorandum of understanding for the planned merger, a source familiar with the situation said.FCA and PSA are expected to finalize a deal by the end of 2020 to create a group with 8.7 million annual vehicle sales, a source said.That would put it fourth globally behind Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and the Renault-Nissan alliance. It was only six months ago that FCA abandoned merger talks with PSA's French rival Renault RENA.PA.FCA would gain access to PSA’s more modern vehicle platforms, helping it meet tough new emissions rules, while Europe-focused PSA would benefit from FCA’s profitable U.S. business featuring brands such as Ram and Jeep.However, the deal could still face close regulatory scrutiny, while governments in Rome, Paris and unions are all likely to be wary about potential job losses from a combined workforce of around 400,000.PSA's Carlos Tavares will be chief executive and FCA's John Elkann - the scion of Italy's Agnelli family, which controls FCA through their holding company Exor EXOR.MI - chairman of the combined company.The group will include the Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Peugeot, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands, allowing it to serve mass and premium passenger car markets as well as those for trucks and light commercial vehicles.	-1.870140786
LE MANS, France (Reuters) - Japanese driver Kazuki Nakajima put the Toyota he shares with double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso on provisional pole for the 24 Hours of Le Mans sportscar race on Wednesday night.Nakajima lapped the dry Sarthe circuit with a fastest time of three minutes 17.270 seconds in the first two-hour night-time qualifying session.Toyota, now the only major manufacturer entered in the top LMP1 category after champions Porsche quit, have only themselves to beat but can take nothing for granted after losing out in 2017 due to unreliability.The Japanese team are seeking their first win at the 20th attempt to become only the second Japanese marque after Mazda to triumph in the endurance classic.The number eight TS050 hybrid of Nakajima, Alonso and Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi was followed on the timesheets by the number seven car of Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi, Britain’s Mike Conway and Argentina’s Jose Maria Lopez.Kobayashi took pole last year in a record 3:14.791 and the track has been shortened by three meters since then for safety improvements.With the possibility of rain on Thursday, when two more qualifying sessions are scheduled, there is a chance that Wednesday’s time will secure pole.While Nakajima set the pace, Le Mans rookie Alonso completed a mandatory five laps in night conditions in a car that took the trio to victory in the opening race of the season at Spa in Belgium.The Spaniard is combining a full Formula One and world endurance season and arrived at the French circuit straight from competing in last Sunday’s�� Canadian Grand Prix for McLaren.Alonso, who has also won the Monaco Grand Prix as well as Formula One titles, is aiming to complete the ‘Triple Crown of Motorport�� and needs to win Le Mans and the Indianapolis 500 to do so.He competed at Indianapolis last year, leading before an engine failure.Frenchman Stephane Sarrazin was third fastest in the number 17 SMP Racing BR1 non-hybrid car with a lap of 3:19.483 while Brazilian Bruno Senna was fourth in the number one Rebellion R13 entry.The non-hybrid LMP1 cars are lighter but thirstier, requiring more and longer pitstops than the Toyotas.Jenson Button, the 2009 Formula One champion, also completed his night laps in the number 11 SMP Racing BR1 that was seventh fastest.The 86th edition of the race starts at 1300GMT (1500 local) on Saturday with Spain’s French Open tennis champion Rafael Nadal the official starter of the 60-strong field.	-4.378322504
* Workers stop production lines as pay talks reach 10 months* Company says left with no option but to lock out workers* Lock-out started Sunday; no indication of end* Raises spectre of violent 2012 labour dispute at Suzuki (Adds shares, Indian sales, market share, context)TOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Indian unit has temporarily closed its two plants where some workers had stopped production lines to protest a delay in salary hikes after 10 months of negotiations.The factories near Bangalore are Toyota Motor’s only vehicle plants in the world’s sixth-biggest auto market, where the Japanese manufacturer generates just a sliver of global sales.Their closure raises the spectre of labour unrest at Indian car plants in recent years, including a 2012 dispute at Suzuki Motor Corp unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. A riot left one person dead and over 100 injured, and resulted in a $250 million month-long production loss.Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), the world’s biggest car maker’s Indian unit, in a statement said some workers over the past 25 days had disrupted business as the management, labour union and local government negotiated wages.“The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel,�� TKM said.The subsidiary closed the factories on Sunday - a non-production day - and did not state when it will reopen them.Closure would result in a daily production loss of 700 vehicles, said Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino in Tokyo.TKM and the union will continue holding talks to resolve the issue, Sumino said.Shares of Toyota Motor were down 0.1 percent at 0531 GMT in Tokyo, in line with the benchmark Nikkei index.India accounted for just 1.6 percent of Toyota Motor’s global sales last year. At that time, the Japanese manufacturer held 4.5 percent of the Indian market having made 174,000 vehicles and sold 147,000.Subsidiary TKM has been building cars at one of the locked-out plants since 1997 including the Fortuner and Innova, and at the other since 2010 including Etios and Corolla Altis.The lockout comes just a week after Toyota Motor gave Japanese workers their biggest pay increase in 21 years, and two months after the automaker said social unrest in Thailand could lead it to rethink investment.

* Fisker says no financial hit due to lost cars* More than 10,000 cars damaged by storm at Port NewarkDETROIT, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Green car startup Fisker Automotive lost more than $30 million worth of luxury cars when a shipment of Karma plug-in hybrids was flooded during Superstorm Sandy last week.More than 300 Karma cars, which each start around $100,000, were destroyed at a New Jersey port during the storm, Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher said on Tuesday.The cars were insured and Fisker expects “no impact from a business or a financial point of view,�� he said, adding that Fisker does not expect any problems with meeting U.S. demand.The 300 Karma plug-in hybrids were among the more than 10,000 vehicles damaged during the storm at Port Newark, Ormisher said, citing details he received from port officials.The other affected automakers include Toyota Motor Corp , which lost 4,500 cars at the port, said Jim Appleton, head of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, which represents more than 500 auto dealers.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Toyota, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the loss of the Karma shipment.Nearly 1 million households and business along the U.S. East Coast remain without power eight days after Sandy hit the region, toppling power lines and flooding areas. New Jersey remains the hardest-hit state.The 300 Karma cars destroyed by last week’s floods were to be sent to U.S. dealers. Among them were 16 cars that burned during the storm after one car caught fire when seawater caused a short circuit. Heavy winds spread the fire to 15 other cars.The news is another setback for Fisker, which has faced several quality and financial setbacks this year. In August, Fisker recalled 2,400 Karma hybrids in August to fix a faulty cooling fan that triggered a vehicle fire.	8.057228916

TOKYO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will recall 7.4 million vehicles globally, including certain Vitz, Yaris and Corolla models, due to malfunctioning power windows, the company said on Wednesday.The Japanese automaker said the recalls include 2.47 million vehicles in the United States, 1.4 million vehicles in China and 1.39 million vehicles in Europe.	5.570469799
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T kept its lead over rivals General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE this year, January-September global sales figures showed, as the Japanese carmaker closes in on a record annual profit.Toyota’s groupwide sales totaled around 7.412 million vehicles, up 0.1 percent from the same period a year ago, the company said on Monday, as strong sales in the United States offset slowdowns in Thailand and China.Toyota's groupwide total includes sales at affiliates Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd 7262.T and Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T.General Motors sold 7.25 million vehicles during the same January to September period, up 4.6 percent year-on-year, while Volkswagen rose 4.8 percent to 7.03 million vehicles, according to figures released earlier this month.Volkswagen’s sales figure however, excludes its Scania and MAN brands. Scania sold around 56,220 vehicles up to September. Scania and MAN brands typically account for a combined 200,000 vehicles in a full year.Toyota regained the global sales crown in 2012 after slipping to third place behind GM and Volkswagen in 2011, following natural disasters in Japan and Thailand. Previously, it had been on top from 2008 through 2010.Analysts expect Toyota to post 2.4 trillion yen ($24.7 billion) in operating profit for the year ending March 2014, more than the record 2.27 trillion yen it hit in the year ended March 2008, as the weaker yen makes exports profitable.For the full year, Toyota, together with Daihatsu and Hino, expects to sell 9.96 million vehicles, up 2 percent from 2012.Toyota, which will announce its July-September results on November 6, is expected to post an operating profit of 616.5 billion yen, nearly double what it posted a year ago.In September, Toyota’s monthly groupwide global vehicle sales rose 6.3 percent from a year ago to 832,000 vehicles.Toyota said September exports to the United States from Japan rose 9 percent from a year ago to around 53,130 vehicles as U.S. demands for the RAV4 and Lexus IS are strong.In Thailand, Toyota’s biggest market in Southeast Asia, sales are slowing after the end of the government’s first-car initiative. September sales dropped about 33 percent year-on-year to 31,000 vehicles, while July-September quarterly sales fell 30 percent to 96,000 vehicles. ($1 = 97.3400 Japanese yen)	-2.461634338

* Autodom in restructuring talks with key stakeholders* Sept vehicle sales gains fail to offset production cuts* Gov monitoring situation, but says it’s a commercial issueCANBERRA, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The closure of Australia’s Autodom Ltd, a top Australian auto parts supplier, could shut down production at local units of Ford and General Motors by next week and executives are working frantically to save the company.Autodom, a $2.1 million supplier of parts to local units of Ford, Toyota and the General Motors Holden unit of GM, has indefinitely closed its plants in two Australian cities amid a halving of car production in the wake of the global financial slowdown.Australia’s automotive industry, based mainly in southern Victoria and South Australia states, is a major contributor to Australia’s manufacturing base with three manufacturers exporting $3.3 billion worth of vehicles a year with the aid of around 160 component makers.But despite hefty government subsidies and tariff support worth around A$2.5 billion ($2.60 billion) a year, the industry has struggled to maintain manufacturing jobs, with the Australian arm of Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors Corp closing its car plants in 2008.The Australian dollar has also traded at record highs above parity with the U.S. dollar over the past year, putting a strain on manufacturing exports.Autodom chief executive Calvin Stead said his company, which employs around 400 people, had been hard hit by high local production and labour costs and manufacturing lines that could not be quickly scaled back.“We need time and assistance to reorganise ourselves,�� Stead said in a statement, adding he was disappointed by the lack of support for his company from key players in the industry.A shutdown of the company’s operations was expected to halt production at Ford and GM Holden as soon as next week. Autodom, which supplies complex metal and plastic components to carmakers, is Australia’s largest press metal manufacturer.Ford, which buys hundreds of components from Autodom for its locally-built “Falcon�� sedan and “Territory�� SUV vehicles, was likely to be most affected by the shutdown.“We are currently assessing what effect it will have on our production,�� Ford Australia spokeswoman Sinead Phipps told local media. “We are okay until the middle of next week, but if it’s not resolved it could potentially affect our production then.”A spokesman for Australia’s Industry Minister Greg Combet said Autodom was negotiating a restructuring proposal with its key automotive stakeholders that could see the plants reopen.“The government is monitoring the situation and is liaising with the motor vehicle producers. However this is a commercial issue between Autodom and its stakeholders,�� he said.GM Holden said the closure could also halt production of large “Commodore�� sedans and smaller “Cruze�� vehicles by next week, with spokesman Craig Cheetham telling caradvice.com.au that Autodom produced “critical components��.GM Holden, a division of U.S. manufacturer General Motors, in February cut 140 jobs from its Adelaide car plant as part of a scaling back of jobs, a week after Toyota cut 350 jobs at its Melbourne operation.Sales of new motor vehicles in Australia surged by the most in 14 months in September to reach an all-time high, a sign consumers have more confidence to splash out on big-ticket items even while being cost-conscious on retail spending.New vehicle sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 4.7 percent in September to 98,701, following an upwardly revised 4.3 percent rise in August. Sales were up a hefty 14.4 percent compared to September last year.	10.10282776
TOKYO, April 24 (Reuters) - Japanese shares hit a two-month closing high on Tuesday with financials leading gains after U.S. bond yields spiked to four-year highs and as investors remained optimistic about upcoming earnings.The Nikkei advanced 0.86 percent to 22,278. From its six-month low hit in late March, it has gained 9.5 percent, and coming near major resistance of 100-day moving average, which came at 22,340.The broader Topix ended 1.08 percent higher at 1,770. Both the Nikkei and the Topix hit their highest close since late February.Large cap shares were particularly favoured, with Topix core 30 gaining 1.24 percent. Small cap shares rose 0.83 percent.Banks rose 2.1 percent, with Mitsubishi UFJ climbing 2.5 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial up 2.0 percent. Insurers gained 1.2 percent.With Japanese financial institutions stepping up investment and lending in the United States in recent years as negative interest rates at home crushed domestic returns, higher U.S. borrowing costs are seen as improving their margins.Exporters also benefited from a fall in the yen to 10-week lows, with Toyota Motor and Shin-Etsu Chemical up 2.0 percent.Turnover at the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board was near the average, at 2.43 trillion yen.Real estate investment trusts were another bright spot, with the REIT index rising 0.4 percent to an 11-week closing high.	2.293967715
* 2010 Lexus HS 250h hybrid also affected* Problem caused when improperly serviced* Rear suspension arms could wear and separateAug 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it is recalling about 760,000 RAV4 utility vehicles and 18,000 Lexus HS 250h hybrid cars in the United States to correct problems in their rear suspension that could arise when taken in for maintenance.The RAV4 cars were made from model years 2006 through 2011, while only 2010 models of the HS 250h were affected.Toyota said that if nuts on the rear suspension arm are not tightened properly during a rear wheel alignment service, rust could form, leading to wear and possibly cause the arm to separate.The car maker will inspect the tightened nut on the recalled vehicles to make sure they meet the proper torque specification.The models carry no design or production-related defects and would not need to be inspected unless alignment work was done, a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said. The company is looking into specific measures to prevent errors during maintenance.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a defect investigation opened June 4 into a similar problem with 2006-2008 Toyota RAV4s, said the rear suspension arm assembly “may fail due to corrosion, potentially causing a loss of vehicle control.”The federal agency said at the time it was probing about 460,000 RAV4s. NHTSA said it had received seven complaints alleging corrosion-related failure of suspension arms on the RAV4.	2.206932364

* Hiroshima beat Auckland 1-0* Goal-line technology used for first time, tests passed (Adds quotes, detail)YOKOHAMA, Japan, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Japan’s Sanfrecce Hiroshima beat part-timers Auckland City 1-0 in the opening game of the Club World Cup on Thursday when FIFA used goal-line technology for the first time.Toshihiro Aoyama’s dipping drive in the 66th minute lit up a pedestrian encounter and sent the J-League champions into the quarter-finals where they will face Egypt’s Al-Ahly.The match was the first in which soccer’s governing body officially used the goal technology although there was little opportunity to test its effectiveness in a game of few chances.FIFA are using two systems in Yokohama and Toyota City after finally bowing to calls to eliminate ‘ghost�� goals from the game.GoalRef, which uses a microchip coil in the ball and low magnetic waves around the goal, was used in Thursday’s game with no problems reported.FIFA said pre-match tests conducted by the referee at both ends of the pitch 100 minutes before kickoff were successful.Hawk-Eye, widely used in cricket and tennis, will be used in Sunday’s quarter-finals in Toyota.FIFA will be given analyses from the competing companies in January and decide which system to use at next year’s Confederations Cup in Brazil.The technology was not needed as Hiroshima eased past the New Zealanders in Yokohama, although Yojiro Takahagi and Ryota Moriwaki hit the woodwork from long distance after the break.The Japanese side dominated the game without providing any real threat inside the box.Dethroned European champions Chelsea and South American Libertadores Cup holders Corinthians join the seven-team competition at the semi-final stage next week.“The score was only 1-0 but we tried to keep attacking,�� Hiroshima manager Hajime Moriyasu told reporters. “There was plenty of motivation and effort.”Auckland coach Ramon Tribulietx put a positive spin on the result. “We have to be happy with the way we played,�� he said. “Don’t forget we are an amateur side - it’s not easy coming up here to play Hiroshima in Japan.�� (Reporting by Alastair Himmer; Editing by Robert Woodward)	10.95238095
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Thursday said that it had confirmed that aluminum plates supplied by Kobe Steel Ltd 5406.T with falsified quality data which were used in parts for some of the Japanese automaker's vehicles had met safety and durability standards.In a statement, Toyota said that it was working to identify whether non-aluminum products supplied by Kobe Steel, which are used in the automakers�� Toyota- and Lexus-branded vehicles, will also meet the standards.Kobe Steel earlier this month admitted that it had falsified data on product quality and specifications for goods supplied to around 500 customers, rocking supply chains around the world in a fresh blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturer.	0.9913057609

GM could not be immediately contacted for comment.GM joins automakers including Toyota Motor Corp and as many as 200 other companies that have received parts sourced from Kobe Steel as the scandal reverberates through global supply chains.On Wednesday fresh revelations showed data fabrication at the steelmaker was more widespread than it initially said, as the company joins a list of Japanese manufacturers that have admitted to similar misconduct in recent years.Investors, worried about the financial impact and potential legal fallout, again dumped Kobe Steel stock, wiping about $1.6 billion off its market value in two days.Kobe Steel President Hiroya Kawasaki is due meet a senior official at the industry ministry on Thursday.	2.013150418
* Automakers report U.S. May sales on June 1* Analysts expect sales pace in May of 14.5 mln* Japanese automakers projected to report outsized sales gainsDETROIT, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales will hover around 14.5 million vehicles in May, spurred by demand for cars and crossovers as Japanese automakers bounce back from last year’s earthquake-related shortages, analysts said.The projected sales are roughly in line with the 14.4 million rate seen in March and April. A year ago at this time, the industry reported lower-than-expected sales, hurt by a shrinking supply of cars and vehicle prices that were too high for consumers trapped in a tepid economic recovery.But now, the auto industry has recovered from the shortages, particularly Japan-based automakers. Incentives, which reduce the price of a vehicle for consumers, also have risen slightly.Industry research firm TrueCar.com expects light vehicle sales to be up 32 percent in May to the highest level in five years. Automakers report their May sales figures on June 1.Volkswagen AG’s U.S. chief, Jonathan Browning, offered a more tempered forecast, saying sales in May would likely rise between 20 percent and 30 percent.The industry is now on the mend after its near-collapse in 2009, when General Motors Co and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy and sales fell to 10.4 million vehicles. By contrast, vehicle sales in the United States averaged around 16.7 million a year between 1998 and 2007.Volkswagen expects industry sales of about 13.9 million vehicles, while J.D. Power and LMC Automotive expect sales of 14.5 million, an increase of about 13 percent from 2011.Of all the major automakers, Toyota Motor Corp is expected to see the biggest bounce, with a 90 percent sales increase. Honda Motor Corp is expected to post a 50 percent sales gain, according to research firm Edmunds.com.Both of these companies sell far more cars than trucks. The Toyota Camry and Honda Accord were the second- and third-best selling cars last month, respectively.“We expect that mid-size sedans will post the largest year-over-year share gains as key Japanese models had limited availability in May 2011,�� RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a research note.No. 1 U.S. automaker GM will post an 11 percent gain, while Ford Motor Co’s sales will jump 16 percent, according to Edmunds projections. Chrysler Group LLC is expected to jump 42 percent.Auto sales have been one of the bright spots in the economy for several months. Vehicle purchases by consumers accounted for 30 percent of U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, according to Credit Suisse.Sales have shot up despite cooling consumer confidence and mixed economic data that illustrates how shaky the recovery has been over the last three years.“At this point, it is almost as if the tail is wagging the dog,�� said Kelley Blue Book analyst Alec Gutierrez. “During a typical post-recession recovery, we would expect to see auto sector gains being driven by broad economic growth. In the first quarter, the opposite was true.”One factor fueling the sales growth has been the increasing need to replace aging cars and trucks, which are now a record 10.8 years old on average.Higher fuel prices in the first quarter prompted some consumers to swap those older, less fuel-efficient models to lock in fuel savings. According to UBS, 63 percent of dealers said higher gasoline prices increased demand in the first quarter.As a result, the pace of sales may “moderate�� in the second and third quarters, but the underlying consumer appetite for new cars and trucks as a result of pent-up demand remains strong, UBS analyst Colin Langan said.Since early April, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline has fallen about 7 percent, U.S. government data shows. This has gradually pushed sales of trucks higher. Barclays Capital expects an 18 percent gain in truck sales in May and a 24 percent increase in cars.	7.178184735
(Reuters) - ChargePoint, one of the world’s oldest and largest electric vehicle charging networks, has closed on a $127 million funding round, much of it from existing investors, the company said on Wednesday.The latest equity financing round gives ChargePoint a total of $660 million raised since its founding in 2007, and most of that has come in the past four years. Before this raise, the company was valued at $1.25 billion by investor website PitchBook.Based in Campbell, California, on the southern edge of Silicon Valley, ChargePoint has attracted funding from both private venture investors and large strategic investors, including German automakers Daimler AG and BMW, German electronics supplier Siemens AG, the venture arm of oil giant Chevron Corp and the trading affiliate of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp.Among returning investors to the latest round are American Electric Power, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Singapore GIC and Chevron Technology Ventures.ChargePoint Chief Executive Pasquale Romano said the new funds will be used to build out the company’s rapidly growing charging network in Europe.“Investor confidence in this segment has gone through the roof,�� Romano said in an interview. “Big investors like the Canada pension board and the Singapore sovereign wealth fund often come in at a later stage to help (a young company) scale up.”An incomplete charging infrastructure that is still being built out in many parts of the world is often cited as one of the bottlenecks holding back mass adoption of electric vehicles.ChargePoint says its global network currently has 115,000 charging ports, most of them in the United States, and it aims to build that to 2.5 million by 2025. In comparison, Tesla said it has about 17,500 chargers worldwide.	2.251831074
BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan’s top carmakers are enjoying strong growth in China, the world’s top auto market, bucking concerns about a slowdown in the market after tax incentives were cut back this year.Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday vehicle sales in China grew close to 15 percent in September, after strong sales in August. Nissan Motor Co Ltd posted similar growth on Monday.After a sluggish start to the year, China’s car market has shifted into a higher gear since mid-year, posting a third successive month of rising sales in August. Overall growth is expected to slow to 5 percent from a double-digit rise in 2016.Analysts said international carmakers were benefiting most from the uptick, even as some Chinese rivals saw sales growth slow and a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Seoul hit South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors.“After a good run in recent months, local Chinese brands are growing much slower now,�� said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight.“That’s why some good foreign (carmakers) are now seeing their sales grow by double-digits.”Toyota’s sales in China grew 14.1 percent in September from a year earlier to 118,900 vehicles, after a 13.2 percent increase in August. It sold 960,400 vehicles in the first nine months of the year, up 7.9 percent against 2016.Honda’s sales in the market were up 15.5 percent for the month, following a 20.6 percent rise in August. Its Jan-Sept sales totaled 1.03 million vehicles, a 17.7 percent increase from the same period a year ago.Honda, the smaller of the two automakers, has been outstripping Toyota in China so far this year, thanks to hot-selling models that include the redesigned Civic and its subcompact crossover SUVs.Toyota, Japan’s top automaker by volume, is still on target to sell more than 1.21 million vehicles this year in China up from the 1.2 million vehicles it sold in 2016.	0.7526707672
Lausanne, Switzerland (Reuters) - The Tokyo 2020 Olympics have generated record domestic sponsorship revenues of more than $3 billion, the International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday - three times more than any previous summer Games.There is huge enthusiasm among the Japanese for the Tokyo Games, and the public have rushed in their millions to buy tickets.The IOC’s Coordination Commission chief for Tokyo, John Coates, said local sponsorship agreements were up to 62 companies for all three tiers of sponsorship arrangements.“This equates to revenues exceeding 3 billion dollars from national partnerships. That is an amazing amount of money,�� Coates told the IOC session.“This does not include the partnerships with (Japanese companies) Toyota, Bridgestone and Panasonic and their contribution to the TOP program.”The three companies have separate deals with the IOC as major sponsors of the organization, worth hundreds of millions of dollars in total.Coates told Reuters revenues currently stood at $3.1 billion and Japanese organizers had filled most categories in their three-tier sponsorship plan.“Not much more,�� Coates said when asked if more domestic deals were expected in the coming months.Tokyo now has 15 gold partners, 32 official partners and 15 companies that have signed up as official supporters.In comparison, the London 2012 Games raised roughly $1.1 billion from domestic sponsors - a record at the time - while Rio de Janeiro in 2016 claimed it had slightly surpassed London, although that is unlikely with final accounts inaccurate given ongoing corruption probes linked to those Olympics.The IOC has been struggling to attract new cities to bid for the Games and awarded the 2026 Winter Olympics on Monday to Milan and Cortina D’Ampezzo after four other cities dropped out and Stockholm was left as the only other bidder.But in Japan, the Games have generated great enthusiasm with 7.5 million citizens registering to apply for tickets through a lottery system, many of whom ended up without any.Tokyo’s bid file had said some 7.8 million tickets would be available for Games but 20-30 percent of those are reserved for international customers and sponsors.��7.5 million ticket (requests). This is an indication of this strong support and high level of interest among the Japanese public,�� Coates said.	7.024089545

* Toyota win Le Mans with dominant one-two finish* Only second Japanese manufacturer to win the endurance race* Double F1 champion Alonso a winner on his debut* Spaniard now has Indy 500 to win to complete Triple Crown* Japan’s Nakajima took the chequered flag (Adds details, quotes)LE MANS, France, June 17 (Reuters) - Toyota ended years of heartache by winning the Le Mans 24 Hours race in dominant fashion on Sunday, with double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso victorious on his debut and now one step away from the Triple Crown of Motorsport.Expected to dominate the 86th edition of the race, as the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category after champions Porsche withdrew last year, Toyota’s victory came at the 20th attempt.With a one-two finish they became only the second Japanese car company, after Mazda in 1991, to win the world’s greatest endurance race.“It’s a shame the 24 Hours of Le Mans only happens once a year. They should hold it every two or three weeks,�� said Alonso, who has not won in F1 for five years.The Spaniard shared the number eight TS050 hybrid with Swiss driver Sebastien Buemi and Japan’s Kazuki Nakajima, who had taken pole position on Thursday and drove the final stint to the chequered flag.The tension in the Toyota garage was palpable as the clock ticked down, Alonso and Buemi linking arms with other team members and praying that there was to be no repeat of past nightmares.In 2016, Nakajima had also been heading for victory when he slowed with five minutes remaining and came to a halt with victory falling into Porsche’s lap.“I can’t really describe it,�� said Buemi, who was also Nakajima’s team mate in 2016, when asked how it felt to win at last.“When you look at the past, 2016 in the last lap, and Kazuki was going to be in the car for the last few laps so lots of emotions really.”The number seven Toyota -- driven by Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi to the chequered flag and shared with Briton Mike Conway and Argentina’s Jose Maria Lopez -- crossed the line in one-two formation with Nakajima but two laps down.The number three non-hybrid Rebellion R13 car -- driven by Frenchman Thomas Laurent, Switzerland’s Mathias Beche and American Gustavo Menezes -- finished third and 12 laps behind.Alonso’s hopes had appeared to dim as the race entered the early hours, with his car two minutes adrift of the sister Toyota after a stop-go penalty.But the Spaniard put in a remarkable stint through the darkness to reduce the deficit and his team mates -- both former F1 drivers -- did their bit to take back control after dawn had broken over the Sarthe circuit.Alonso, who is also a double Monaco Grand Prix winner, has made a big play about becoming only the second driver to take the ‘Triple Crown of Motorsport�� and Le Mans is the second box to be ticked.The McLaren driver, who will remain in France for next weekend’s Grand Prix at Le Castellet, has yet to win the Indianapolis 500 -- a race he led last year before an engine failure -- to match the late Graham Hill’s achievement.There has been speculation that a Le Mans win could hasten the 36-year-old’s departure from Formula One, with McLaren still a long way off the podium.

NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N dispatched its top brass, including Chief Executive Alan Mulally, to major U.S. cities on Tuesday to promote the 2013 Fusion, its redesigned family sedan that takes aim at Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Camry.The second-largest U.S. automaker began shipping the Fusion, which boasts a more athletic design and more fuel economy options, to dealers last week. Ford hopes the third-generation Fusion, coupled with the new Escape crossover launched this spring, will boost its U.S. market share.The media blitz comes as Ford’s board of directors develops a succession plan for Mulally, 67. Ford is also cutting costs in Europe, where it expects to lose more than $1 billion this year. Ford’s sales in Europe fell 29 percent in August, while overall industry sales dropped 8.5 percent.“There is a tremendous decrease in demand, but we’re absolutely committed to Europe,�� Mulally said at a Fusion event in New York. “That will involve some restructuring.”The board is looking to name Mark Fields, Ford’s head of North and South America, chief operating officer, a sign that he could be the heir apparent to Mulally, a source told Reuters last week.But on Tuesday, Mulally kept a lid on the finer details of Ford’s plans for Europe and his own plans for retirement. He said Ford has a strong internal bench of potential leaders and he was “pleased to continue to serve as CEO of Ford.”�Please don’t vote me off,�� he joked to reporters.Under Mulally’s “One Ford�� plan, Ford is moving toward building more cars using fewer platforms, a move that cuts costs but allows Ford to offer more features at a lower price.The Fusion is the latest Ford car to receive a global overhaul, after the Fiesta subcompact and Focus compact car. The Fusion will be sold as the Mondeo in Europe and China. These models share about 75 percent of the same parts.The Fusion competes in the midsize sedan segment of the U.S. auto market, dominated by the Toyota Camry and Honda Motor Co's 7267.T Accord. Through August, sales in this bread-and-butter segment have risen 26 percent, while overall auto sales are up 15 percent, Ford said.“This is a transitional vehicle for our company,�� J Mays, Ford’s chief creative officer, said Monday night at an event in Miami Beach. He compared its impact to the 1955 Thunderbird, the 1962 Lincoln Continental or the 1964 Mustang.The base model of the revamped Fusion will cost $21,000, the same as the base price of the outgoing Fusion, Mays said.TOUTING ��47�� MPGFord is offering three gasoline-powered versions of the Fusion as well as a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. In a press release, Ford said the Fusion hybrid gets 47 miles per gallon on the highway and in the city, beating out the Camry hybrid.At the New York event with American Idol host Ryan Seacrest, Mulally held a sign touting the ��47�� figure. Ford also passed out T-shirts with the Fusion hybrid’s fuel economy figures.Boosting fuel efficiency has been a pillar of Ford’s vehicle strategy for the past six years. Ford is vying beat Toyota’s record on fuel economy with new electrified models this year.Ford must also meet federal government’s corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) target of 54.5 mpg by 2025. This translates to 36 mpg or higher in real world driving, analysts say.The average fuel economy of Ford’s cars and trucks for model year 2011 was 21.3 mpg, up from 18 mpg in 2006, U.S. government data shows. The industry average for 2011 was 22.8 mpg.To meet these ambitious standards, Ford is counting on turbocharged engines, start-stop systems, hybrid technology “and something we haven’t invented yet,�� said Raj Nair, Ford’s head of product development, at an event near Detroit.Ford plans to cut weight from future models by using lightweight materials. Ford is also designing and making key electric-drive components in-house to cut costs and accelerate development of these technologies.Buyers of the 1.6-liter Fusion with a turbocharged engine can purchase the $295 auto start-stop system, which shuts the engine off when the car is stopped at a light. Ford is looking to provide this option in a larger number of its vehicles.The Fusion also offers a lane-keeping system that alerts a driver if the car drifts into another lane. The Fusion can also parallel park itself, with the active park assist feature.“That’s been a key point in our turnaround and our success, we’ve really pushed on being a technology leader and making sure we bring those technologies to the mainstream,�� Nair said.	-5.2932587
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T is proving that being late to the party in China doesn't have to be a handicap, and is poised to widen its lead among Japanese automakers in the world's biggest car market with speedy and aggressive expansion plans.Despite being among the last global automakers to enter the Chinese market, Nissan outsold Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to become the top Japanese light-vehicle brand there last year for the first time, according to research firm LMC Automotive.Aiding Nissan's climb have been its cooperative partnership with state-owned Dongfeng Motor Group 0489.HK in the heavily regulated market.It is also benefitting from an early foray into the booming inland regions and a full product line-up ranging from premium Infiniti-brand cars to light commercial vehicles and compacts such as the popular Tiida model.After a bumper 2011, Nissan’s local joint venture, Dongfeng Motor Co, was the fastest-growing automaker in China in the first quarter of 2012, growing 16 percent in a market that fell 0.3 percent from the year before.In another step to accelerate its growth, Nissan this week unveiled at the Beijing auto show the first production model under its joint venture’s own, entry-level Venucia brand, following China’s directive for all foreign car makers to form a separate brand with their local partners to help the country’s fledgling industry gain technological know-how.“We want to be a global car maker, presenting every single kind of product you can find in the Nissan brand - from the luxury, with Infiniti, and the entry level with affordable cars under Venucia,�� Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told Reuters TV at the show. “We’re going to be everywhere.”Dongfeng Nissan, the joint venture’s passenger car arm, said it aims to add a new Venucia model every year, targeting annual sales of 300,000 vehicles by 2015, with five products and 250 exclusive dealers.In another move that promises to nudge Nissan further ahead of Toyota and Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Japan's No.2 automaker said last week it would begin producing Infiniti vehicles in China from 2014, putting it on a more level playing field with dominant German brands that build locally and avoid import tariffs of 25 percent. Toyota and Honda executives have said they have no immediate plans to produce their Lexus and Acura premium vehicles in China.“Nissan’s management has been unsparing and speedy in its investments in emerging markets, particularly China,�� said Kenji Yoshida, a partner at consultancy PwC. “That’s definitely helping them.”All the while, Toyota and Honda have seen their market share slip in the past four years as competition intensifies in the mid-sized sedan segment where their core Camry and Accord models had driven sales. Honda’s sales in China fell for the first time in 2011, although part of that was due to a supply shortage resulting from Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March.Toyota and Honda also missed the trend towards affordable compact cars as consumers sought better fuel economy. Gasoline prices in China have soared about 60 percent over the last three years, to more than 8 yuan ($1.27) per litre.Both automakers are looking to fight back.“We were a bit thin in the compact segment,�� Honda CEO Takanobu Ito conceded. “Our first priority is to add more compact models and increase our sales volumes,�� he told reporters in Beijing. Honda on Monday announced plans for a new factory that would boost its output capacity in China by roughly a third to 1.01 million cars a year by 2014.Toyota, for its part, unveiled a design-oriented compact concept model, called the “Toyota Qin��, aimed at attracting young buyers. It has said it aims to roughly double its Chinese sales to 1.6-1.8 million vehicles by 2015.Nissan, meanwhile, is aiming to boost its annual output capacity in China by two-thirds to 2 million vehicles by the end of 2015, and its market share to 10 percent from 7.4 percent.Like Honda, Toyota acknowledged that its recent growth in China has been wanting, especially considering its top-three standing in global sales.“In the United States and Japan, we are very successful, but we are only number five (among foreign car makers) in China,�� said Dong Changzheng, a top executive at Toyota’s Chinese subsidiary.“At the same time, we’re not targeting an expansion in sales volumes as much as a leadership position in vehicle technology,�� he told reporters on Tuesday.Under a new local marketing campaign that started last month, Toyota has been promoting the advantages of hybrid technology, in which it has a big lead globally but which has failed to catch on in China due to its hefty price premium over conventional gasoline cars. At the auto show, Toyota also debuted a China-only hybrid concept car, called “Yundong Shuangqing��, that will be sold from 2015 with a hybrid system developed primarily at its new Chinese R&amp;D centre.“Gasoline prices are rising so the real cost of hybrid cars for the customer should come down,�� Dong said, adding that localizing hybrid parts should also lower production costs. “We want to help spread hybrids over the next three years.”Toyota said it would also launch a plug-in hybrid car in China this year, moving the plan forward by one year.Nissan’s Ghosn argued, however, that conventional hybrids were at a disadvantage after the Chinese government last week set a target of putting 5 million plug-in hybrids and pure-electric vehicles on the road between now and 2020.The government says it will provide generous subsidies for those cars as long as they use batteries procured locally. Under the policy, foreign battery makers will only be able to manufacture in a minority-held joint venture, raising concerns over technology transfer.Nissan, which has made zero-emission leadership a major pillar of its global strategy, has committed to building electric cars in China by 2015, under the Venucia brand. Ghosn said Nissan and its French partner, Renault SA RENA.PA, were prepared to follow any guideline put forward by Beijing.“I think Nissan’s run will continue,�� said Credit Suisse auto analyst Kunihiko Shiohara, noting that success in China hinged not just on product-competitiveness but factors such as good relations with the government. “In that respect, Nissan seems much more committed and is in a better position.��($1 = 6.3088 Chinese yuan)	-5.604719764
HONG KONG, April 2 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares could be a little slow to start after a four-day Easter weekend, facing anaemic U.S. data and prolonged weakness in mainland Chinese markets.Chinese shares fell to their lowest since the start of the year on Monday after an official purchasing managers�� survey showed a slower rebound in factory activity than expected.China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers�� index (PMI) released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday rose to an 11-month high of 50.9 in March, below a Reuters poll consensus forecast of 52.0.Last Thursday, the Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7 percent at 22,299.6. The China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong shed 1.3 percent.

TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday posted an 11 percent rise in second-quarter profit on the back of ongoing sales growth in Asia and Europe, while profitability in most of its major markets including North America improved.Operating profit at Japan’s largest automaker was 579.1 billion yen ($5.11 billion) for the July-September period. That was up from 522.2 billion yen a year earlier, but undershot a median forecast of 584.89 billion yen from 10 analysts polled by Refinitiv.Toyota lifted its forecast for full-year profit to come in at 2.4 trillion yen, from a previous forecast of 2.3 trillion yen, based on a revised assumption that the yen will average around 110 yen to the U.S. dollar through March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are finally embracing electric cars, showcasing concepts ranging from compact sportscars to all-wheel-drive mini SUVs at this week’s Tokyo Motor show, although they haven’t given up on alternative technologies.After years of investing in hydrogen fuel cells and electric-gasoline hybrids, Japanese manufacturers are talking up all-battery electric vehicles (EVs) at the annual gathering.Many are looking to catch up with global rivals amid rapidly tightening global emissions regulations and improving technology that may make EV batteries a price-competitive option to gasoline engines in the coming years.“As far as green cars go, vehicle powertrain electrification is a must,�� said Soichiro Okudaira, president of Daihatsu Motor Co, a fully owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp, which showed its concept of the “Pro Cargo�� multi-use mini electric van at the show’s first media day on Wednesday .“EV (technology) is a great match with small cars people use everyday to commute, go shopping, because it’s easy to charge and maintain.”Even Toyota, the country’s largest automaker which set up an EV development team just a year ago, said pure EVs would be one of the “key solutions�� for cleaner vehicles in the near future.Still, the maker of the Mirai fuel cell vehicle (FCV) is sticking to its view that the hydrogen fuel cell is the ultimate “green car�� technology.Analysts say FCVs can refuel faster than an EV can recharge and can travel longer distances, making them a potentially attractive option for larger vehicles - though the cost and limited refuelling infrastructure pose challenges.Underlining its point, Toyota introduced two new FCVs at the show: the six-seater “Fine-Comfort Ride�� concept car, and the “Sora�� fuel-cell bus, which will be launched next year.Honda Motor Co on Wednesday announced it would launch a compact EV in Japan in 2020, following Nissan Motor Co, long a proponent of EVs and maker of the Leaf, the world’s best-selling battery electric car launched in 2010.As advances in lithium ion battery technology improve charging times and lower production costs, some automakers and suppliers expect increased demand will boost EV sales within the next decade, lowering their price towards gasoline vehicles.“We see this tipping point happening around 2025. By then for the customer to buy petrol or EV it will be practically same cost,�� Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci said.“And then ... if you have the same price for EVs and petrol why would you buy traditional technology?”While global automakers acknowledge the internal combustion engine may become obsolete in the coming decades, smaller automaker Mazda Motor Corp continues to squeeze more efficiency out of gasoline engines, developing its spark-ignition compression engine which it says could improve fuel economy by as much as 30 percent.Others argue that reports of the death of the gasoline engine have been greatly exaggerated.“Many in the media appear to be saying that EVs are going to take over the world, but given ongoing technology and cost limitations, it will be difficult for that to happen anytime soon,�� Subaru Corp CEO Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said.	1.719822366

(Corrects company name in paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 to Toyota Tsusho Corp from Toyota and the stock code to 8015.T from 6201.T)VIENNA, May 30 (Reuters) - Baghdad has turned to France’s Total and Japan’s Toyota Tsusho Corp for gasoline after Washington blacklisted an Iranian company that had been delivering product, industry sources said on Thursday.Sima General Trading Company, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), had been supplying Iraq with up to three cargoes of gasoline per month - about a quarter of what Iraq now imports.But in mid-March, the U.S. Treasury Department identified the company as part of a UAE-based network of Iranian government front companies that did business on behalf of previously sanctioned entities such as Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO)- a unit of the National Iranian Oil Co.Washington persuaded Baghdad to stop the trade - worth over $40 million a month at current prices - the sources said, and Total and Toyota Tsusho will step in from June through the end of the year. They join a pool of companies supplying Iraq.Total will supply two cargoes of gasoline a month and Japan’s Toyota Tsusho will supply one, according to the industry sources. Each cargo is roughly 15,000 tonnes. Total will deliver its first shipment in June 13-15.“We are asking for Iraq, as well as other countries, to reduce the import of crude oil and oil products such as gasoline from Iran,�� said a U.S. diplomat.“Both Treasury and State have been very active in talking with our international partners.”Due to the size of Iraq’s oil products tenders, traders closely monitor purchases by its State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO).SOMO could not be reached for immediate comment.SOMO last November finalised a deal to buy 1.56 million tonnes of gasoline from a pool of suppliers and the contract was awarded to rival oil firms Vitol and Glencore, along with oil major BP and Sima.Despite being OPEC’s second largest crude oil producer, years of violence, militant attacks and low investment have forced Iraq to rely on imports to meet demand for oil products like gasoline as its own refineries struggle.

15. Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen aus der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus:FRESENIUS - Frankfurt: Der Gesundheitskonzern rechnet im Zusammenhang mit der Virus-Krise mit keinen größeren Einbußen. “Insgesamt bleibe ich dabei: Die eine oder andere Schramme werden wir noch abbekommen��, sagte Konzernchef Stephan Sturm der “FAZ�� laut Vorabbericht. “Größere finanzielle Einbußen sollten uns aber erspart bleiben. Wir werden diese Krise gut meistern.�� In China sehe er mittlerweile eine weitgehende Normalisierung. “In unseren Werken produzieren wir wieder voll. Auch die Logistik innerhalb des Landes hat sehr zügig Fortschritte gemacht.�� In Amerika, wo Fresenius mit der Tochter Fresenius Medical Care stark vertreten ist, sieht er positive Anzeichen. “Inzwischen ist meine Wahrnehmung, dass wir auch in den USA den Scheitelpunkt überschritten haben und darauf hoffen können, dass wir graduell hin zu einer Normalisierung kommen.”VIRGIN ATLANTIC - London: Die Pläne der britischen Regierung, im Land ankommende Reisende mit einer Quarantäne von 14 Tagen zu belegen, erschweren die Lage bei der Airline weiter. Sollte das Vorhaben umgesetzt werden, halte dies Fluggäste fern und Virgin werde frühestens im August den Flugbetrieb wieder aufnehmen, sagte ein Insider aus dem Umfeld des Unternehmens. Ohne Quarantäne könne vielleicht schon im Juli wieder geflogen werden. Der britische Virgin-Besitzer Richard Branson hat - wie viele andere Fluggesellschaften auch - Staatshilfe beantragt, um die Coronakrise mit ihren Reisebeschränkungen zu überstehen.FIAT CHRYSLER - Mailand: Der Autobauer bemüht sich angesichts der Coronakrise einem Insider zufolge um eine milliardenschwere Staatsbürgschaft. Das Unternehmen spreche mit der italienischen Großbank Intesa Sanpaolo über einen vom Staat garantierten Kredit im Volumen von 6,3 Milliarden Euro, sagte eine mit dem Vorgang vertraute Person Reuters. Fiat Chrysler und die Bank lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab.VF CORP - Bangalore: Der US-Hersteller von Vans-Schuhen und Timberland-Stiefeln rechnet wegen der durch das Coronavirus verursachten Ladenschließungen im laufenden Quartal mit Umsatzeinbußen von mehr als der Hälfte. “In den ersten zehn Monaten des Fiskaljahres 2019/2020 hat unser Unternehmen Ergebnisse erzielt, die über unseren langfristigen Wachstumszielen liegen. Dann veränderte sich die Welt für uns alle wegen COVID-19��, sagte VF-Corp-Chef Steve Rendle. Davon seien auch die Lieferanten betroffen, ferner würden viele Werke mit reduzierter Kapazität arbeiten. Für das im März beendete vierte Quartal des Geschäftsjahres 2019/20 meldete das in Denver, Colorado, ansässige Unternehmen einen Nettoverlust von 483,8 Millionen Dollar, verglichen mit einem Gewinn von 128,8 Millionen Dollar im Vorjahreszeitraum. Der Nettoumsatz sank um etwa zwei Prozent auf 2,1 Milliarden Dollar und lag damit unter den Analysten-Schätzung von 2,28 Milliarden Dollar. VF-Corp gab keinen Ausblick auf das aktuelle Geschäftsjahr 2020/2021.TOYOTA - Tokio: Der japanische Autobauer plant wegen der Coronavirus-Krise seine heimische Produktion im Juni zu reduzieren. Wegen der geringeren Nachfrage nach Neuwagen werde der Konzern nun 122.000 Einheiten weniger herstellen, teilte Toyota mit. Dies entspreche einer 40-prozentigen Kürzung gegenüber den bisherigen Prognosen für den Monat Juni.BMW - München: Der Autobauer beginnt mit der angekündigten Herstellung von Atemschutzmasken in Deutschland. Zwei vollautomatische Anlagen produzieren im Werk Wackersdorf bei Regensburg täglich insgesamt bis zu 200.000 Mund-Nase-Masken, mit denen sich BMW-Mitarbeiter vor dem Coronavirus schützen sollen. Spezialmaschinen und Rohmaterial stammen ebenfalls aus Bayern. Die Maschinen lieferte der zum chinesischen Autozulieferer Ningbo Joyson Electronic gehörende deutsche Hersteller PIA Automation. Vliesstoffe kommen vom bayerischen Textilkonzern Sandler. Die Bundesregierung will die heimische Produktion von Masken und weiterer medizinischer Ausrüstung ankurbeln.OTTOBOCK �� Danzig: Das Medizintechnikunternehmen hat im vergangenen Jahr erstmals einen Jahresumsatz von mehr als einer Milliarde Euro erzielt. Der Umsatz kletterte 2019 um 8,2 Prozent auf 1,003 Milliarden Euro, wie Ottobock mitteilte. Der bereinigte operative Gewinn (Ebitda) stieg um zehn Prozent auf 191 Millionen Euro. Damit verbesserte sich die Ebitda-Marge auf 19,2 Prozent. “Im nächsten Schritt wollen wir ein Niveau von 20 Prozent erreichen��, sagte Finanzchef Jörg Wahlers. Für 2020 habe Ottobock das Wachstumstempo eigentlich steigern wollen, doch die Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise auf die Geschäftszahlen seien noch nicht abschätzbar, sagte Firmenchef Philipp Schulte-Noelle. “In den ersten Monaten waren wir voll auf Kurs, diese Ziele zu erreichen.�� Sobald sich die Situation normalisiert habe, rechne das Unternehmen mit Nachholeffekten.FOXCONN - Taipeh: Der Gewinn des taiwanischen Elektronikherstellers ist im ersten Quartal um fast 90 Prozent eingebrochen. Der Nettogewinn von Foxconn - früher Hon Hai Precision - rutschte auf 2,1 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar (rund 65 Millionen Euro), da die Corona-Pandemie die Nachfrage von Apple und anderen Großkunden drückte, wie Foxconn mitteilte. Dies liegt deutlich unter den Analystenschätzungen von 8,88 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar. Der Konzern erwartet jedoch ein zweistelliges Umsatzwachstum im zweiten Quartal, da die Produktion in China wieder hochgefahren ist. “Hon Hai wird sich im zweiten Quartal stabilisieren��, erklärte der Konzern.FORTUM/UNIPER - Helsinki: Der finnische Energieversorger Fortum hat im ersten Quartal weniger verdient. Der operative Gewinn schrumpfte um vier Prozent auf 393 Millionen Euro, lag damit aber noch über den Erwartungen der Analysten. Der Mehrheitseigentümer des Düsseldorfer Versorgers Uniper konnte Einbußen durch niedrigere Strompreise weitgehend durch Absicherungsgeschäfte ausgleichen. Fortum bekräftigte, im Laufe des Jahres mit Uniper eine gemeinsame Strategie zu entwickeln.WÜSTENROT &amp; WÜRTTEMBERGISCHE (W&amp;W) - München: Der Gewinn des Bauspar- und Versicherungskonzerns ist wegen des Abschwungs an den Kapitalmärkten in der Coronakrise im ersten Quartal um zwei Drittel eingebrochen. Das Nettoergebnis sei auf 25,0 (78,5) Millionen Euro gesunken, teilte W&amp;W mit. Grund dafür war ein negatives Finanzergebnis. Die Pandemie zeigte sich vor allem bei der Bausparkasse Wüstenrot, deren Brutto-Neugeschäft um 13 Prozent einbrach. Damit habe sie aber noch Marktanteile gewonnen, erklärte W&amp;W. Die Gewinnprognose für 2020 hatte der Konzern bereits Anfang Mai gekappt.CATHAY PACIFIC - Sydney: Die Fluggesellschaft bezeichnet ihre Aussichten wegen der Coronavirus-Pandemie als “sehr düster��. Die Passagierzahlen von Cathay Pacific brachen im April um 99,6 Prozent ein. “Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt sehen wir noch keine unmittelbaren Anzeichen für eine Verbesserung��, sagte Ronald Lam, Manager bei Cathay Pacific. Das Hongkonger Unternehmen verbuchte im Zeitraum Januar bis April einen ungeprüften Verlust von 4,5 Milliarden Hongkong-Dollar (537,1 Millionen Euro).GEA - Düsseldorf: Der für die Nahrungsmittel- und Getränkeindustrie produzierende Anlagenbauer hat bislang keine größeren Auswirkungen der Coronakrise zu spüren bekommen. So stieg der Auftragseingang um 16 Prozent auf 1,38 Milliarden Euro und markierte damit eine Bestmarke für ein erstes Quartal. Bei einem Umsatzplus um 3,5 Prozent auf 1,09 Milliarden Euro stieg das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) vor Restrukturierungsaufwand um 40,7 Prozent auf 105 Millionen Euro. “Gea ist sehr gut in das Geschäftsjahr 2020 gestartet. Auch wenn die Dauer und damit die finanziellen Auswirkungen von Covid-19 nur schwer abzuschätzen sind, halten wir an unserem Ausblick für 2020 fest��, betonte Vorstandschef Stefan Klebert.AURUBIS - Düsseldorf: Der Kupferkonzern ist dank gestiegener Preise im ersten Halbjahr des Bilanzjahres 2019/20 trotz der Coronakrise noch glimpflich davon gekommen. Bei einem Umsatzanstieg auf 6,013 (Vorjahr: 5,7) Milliarden Euro schrumpfte das Vorsteuerergebnis auf 91 (103) Millionen Euro. “Angesichts der Covid-19-Pandemie haben wir Aurubis bisher gut durch die Krise gesteuert��, erklärte Vorstandschef Roland Harings. Er bekräftigte daher seine Jahresziele.VARTA - Düsseldorf: Wegen der hohen Nachfrage nach Lithium-Ionen-Zellen und dank eines Zukaufs ist der schwäbische Batteriehersteller mit deutlichen Zuwächsen ins Jahr gestartet. Der Umsatz schnellte um rund 170 Prozent auf 198,5 Millionen Euro, ohne Akquisitionen hätte der Zuwachs bei 68,2 Prozent gelegen. Das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) stieg in den ersten drei Monaten um 197 Prozent auf 51,7 Millionen Euro, bereinigt um 135 Prozent. Der Vorstand bekräftigte seine Prognose für 2020, die einen Umsatz zwischen 780 und 800 Millionen Euro vorsieht, ein Wachstum zwischen 115 und 120 Prozent.OFFICE DEPOT - Bangalore: Der US-Büroartikelhersteller kündigt die Streichung von rund 13.100 Arbeitsplätzen und die Schließung von Filialen an. Die Maßnahmen sollen bis Ende 2023 umgesetzt werden und zu Nettoeinsparungen von 860 Millionen Dollar führen, wie das Management bekanntgab. Zugleich werden durch den Abbau Belastungen von bis zu 543 Millionen Dollar erwartet. Office Depot will sich künftig stärker auf sein Geschäft mit IT-Dienstleistungen konzentrieren.OMV - Wien: Beim Wiener Erdöl- und Gaskonzern werden die Reiseausgaben von Vorstandschef Rainer Seele und die Sponsoring-Aktivitäten des Unternehmens unter die Lupe genommen. Eine entsprechende Prüfung ordnete der Aufsichtsrat an, wie dessen Vorsitzender Wolfgang Berndt mitteilte. Hintergrund ist ein Bericht der Onlineplattform dossier.at. Diesem zufolge zahlte OMV für Seeles Nutzung von Privatflugzeugen seit 2016 insgesamt 400.000 Euro. Die Sponsorenvereinbarung mit dem Fußballclub Zenit St. Petersburg, dem angeblichen Lieblingsteam des russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin, habe 25 Millionen Euro gekostet. Aufsichtsratschef Berndt sagte der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters, Seeles und seine eigenen Reiseausgaben von 2017 bis 2019 würden untersucht. Das gelte auch für alle Sponsoringausgaben.NIKE - Bangalore: Der US-Sportartikelhersteller erwartet eine Belastung der Finanzergebnisse im laufenden Geschäftsquartal durch die coronabedingten Filialschließungen rund um den Globus. Das teilte der Adidas- und Puma-Konkurrent am Donnerstag nach US-Börsenschluss mit. Nike fährt zwar sein E-Commerce-Geschäft hoch, um die gestiegenen Internetbestellungen stemmen zu können. Aber je nach Land sind nach Angaben des Managements derzeit nur fünf bis 40 Prozent der Nike-Filialen offen. In mehr als 15 Ländern hat das Unternehmen nach den Schließungen im Zuge der Viruskrise wieder Geschäfte geöffnet, darunter Deutschland, Frankreich, Brasilien und die USA.

SHANGHAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd and its Chinese joint venture partner sold 1.22 million vehicles in China in 2014, up 0.5 percent from the previous year, the Japanese carmaker said on Wednesday.In the month of December, Nissan sold 121,900 vehicles, down 9.1 percent from a year earlier, the sixth straight month the carmaker has seen sales decline in China.Japanese carmakers in China have faced the twin challenges of a slowing economy and political tension between Beijing and Tokyo over the past year. The growth rate of China’s auto market, the world’s biggest, halved to around 7 percent in 2014.Nissan, which operates a car venture in China with Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd, revised its 2014 China forecast in November to reflect slowing sales.Rival Toyota Motor Corp forecast on Tuesday that its pace of growth in China would halve to 6.8 percent in 2015 after it failed to meet last year’s target.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T warning it could rethink further investment plans in Thailand looks aimed at signaling its deep frustration over a drawn-out political crisis, but Japanese car makers are unlikely to scale back Thai operations any time soon.Until recently the likes of Toyota, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T have said mostly that anti-government protests in Bangkok, now in their third month, were having little impact on their local bases.But Toyota has broken ranks, with the head of the company’s Thai subsidiary saying on Monday it may reconsider a planned investment of up to $609 million, and could even cut production, if the unrest drags on.“Japanese companies have continued to invest in Thailand even in the face of big floods and past political turmoil,�� a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.“Regardless of what might happen with investments there, the message was an alarm bell.”The Thai government said on Tuesday it would impose a 60-day state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding provinces as it attempts to contain a protest movement that has blockaded parts of the capital and is seeking the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.Auto manufacturing is Thailand’s third-largest industry, accounting for more than 10 percent of gross domestic product, with an annual output of around 2.5 million vehicles that has seen it dubbed the “Detroit of the East��.Japanese car makers have been investing in Thailand for decades and have come to rely on the country as an export hub. They also control around 80 percent of the Thai car market, the biggest in Southeast Asia.In the short-term Japanese car makers are unlikely to shift production elsewhere given the country’s crucial position in their global manufacturing strategy.Toyota makes about one-in-10 of its cars in Thailand and plans to invest around 20 billion baht ($609 million) to boost annual capacity by 200,000 vehicles over the next three or four years, to 1 million vehicles.Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T have each positioned Thailand as a hub to manufacture small cars, exporting them not only to neighboring countries in Southeast Asia but also to Japan.But the current political woes could spur car makers to diversify their manufacturing base over the longer term, said Shingo Ikeda, a principal at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, Southeast Asia.Indonesia, with roughly four times the population, is expected to surpass Thailand as the region’s biggest auto market in the next few years, and would be the most likely alternative, since Japanese automakers already make cars there and labor costs are relatively low.“Unlike in the past when it was single-handedly dependent on Thailand, Toyota has more leeway to shift to Indonesia the production capacity that it plans to add to Thailand,�� said Ryuichiro Inoue, a professor at Tokyo City University and an auto industry expert.For example, Toyota theoretically could shift production of its multi-purpose vehicle series called IMV, developed as global models with similar structure and parts, from Thailand to Indonesia relatively easily.But any such shift would not happen quickly. Given the hefty investments that car makers have made into Thailand, the country will remain a dominant manufacturing site for the time being, helped by a strong supplier network and highly trained workers.For now, Japanese car makers other than Toyota say they will be sticking with their investment plans in Thailand.“There is no change in our stance of continuing to position Thailand as one of our key overseas manufacturing sites,�� Mazda spokeswoman Misato Kobayashi said.Nissan is investing 11 billion Thai baht ($335 million) in its second Thai plant, which will start operating by end-March. Honda is also building a second car plant there with an investment of 17.2 billion baht and a start-up target of 2015. Mazda is building a $250 million transmission plant.($1 = 104.0350 Japanese yen)($1 = 32.8400 Thai baht)	-4.396417125

DETROIT (Reuters) - Connecting a mobile phone and giving voice commands are still causing drivers problems, but new technology features will be highly desirable to buyers when they make their next new vehicle purchase, according to a study of auto dependability released on Wednesday.Looks and exterior design are still the top reasons why people avoid buying a certain model, J.D. Power said. But if a car, truck of SUV does not have the latest technology, 15 percent said they would not buy it, up from only 4 percent last year.The annual J.D. Power study is one of several that taken together show that certain brands -- Lexus, Toyota and of late, General Motors�� Buick and Chevrolet brands -- are getting consistently high marks, while others consistently struggle to get above average despite quality control effortsLexus, the luxury brand from Toyota Motor Corp, scored the highest for the fourth straight year in the J.D. Power study.On Tuesday, the influential Consumer Reports magazine rated Lexus the best brand in the U.S. market for the third straight year.In both studies, General Motors Co’s Buick made big moves upward, finishing second in the J.D. Power survey and becoming the first U.S. brand to be in the top 10 of the Consumer Reports brand report card.Joining Buick in the top 10 in J.D. Power study were GM’s Cadillac at fourth, with Chevrolet and GMC tied for 10th. There were 31 brands ranked.“GM has improved relative to the industry average for seven straight years.�� said Dave Sargent, vice president of Global Automotive Research at J.D. Power.He said Buick still has a “relatively older owner profile�� of buyers who look after their cars and are more apt to go to dealers, where they can be helped with adapting to new technologies.Ford Motor Co has been more aggressive introducing technologies such as voice controls, and its namesake brand fell to 25th from 17th last year and 13th in 2013. Ford says its newer systems are easier to use.The Toyota brand, Honda and Volkswagen AG’s VOWG_p.DE Porsche rounded out the top half-dozen brands.Two consistently low-scoring brands were at the bottom of the J.D. Power study. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Fiat finished last while next-to-last was Land Rover, owned by Tata Motors of India.	4.203216374
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T expects to treble its operating profit this year to more than $12.5 billion - still less than half what it earned before the global financial crisis - as Japan's top automaker recovers lost ground in markets from the United States to China.Operating profit jumped more than five-fold in January-March to $3 billion, with all production centers back up and running after last year’s earthquake, tsunami and Thai floods disrupted supply chains and cost Toyota around 400,000 cars in lost output - roughly 9 weeks�� worth of U.S. sales.With robust top-line growth a given in the current year - the company predicts operating profit of 1 trillion yen ($12.54 billion), in line with market forecasts - Toyota is looking to squeeze further cost cuts in a battle to offset a strong yen. Executives say they have gone back to a war on waste - or “muda�� - a key component of its vaunted production system.At a briefing on Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Satoshi Ozawa noted the “huge contribution from all the (cost-cutting) efforts we’ve been making.”Toyota President Akio Toyoda, the 56-year-old grandson of the automaker’s founder, said everyone in the company had worked towards improving profitability, and “the focus on making good cars has translated into sales volumes and profits. That in turn is leading to investments for even better cars,�� he said.With U.S. dealerships humming again, Toyoda and his aides have sketched out a strategy aimed at stripping costs from everything - from production lines in Japan to Mississippi to the years of design and engineering that go into making new cars and parts.The goal is to push up profit margins even as Toyota rides a wave of recovering demand while tapping into its tradition of incremental improvement - or “kaizen�� - the corporate creed that once made it the world’s most feared and studied manufacturer.Toyota expects operating margins to improve this year to 4.5 percent from 1.9 percent in the year just ended. That gets it closer to a target of a minimum 5 percent margin before 2015, but is still short of Nissan Motor Co's 7201.T 7.1 percent margin and 6.5 percent at Honda Motor Co 7267.T, the Japanese automaker that was slowest to recover from last year's lost output. South Korean rival Hyundai Motor's 005380.KS operating margin tops 10 percent.Toyota said sales in emerging markets were in line with its plans, including in China where January-April sales were heading for a full-year target of 1 million vehicles.“As we seek growth in emerging markets, a big challenge for us in a market like China, for example, is how to speed up product launches and come up with the right products for the market,�� Toyoda said.Despite the pain of building cars at home with the dollar far below the 85 yen breakeven level in Japan, Toyota has committed to build at least 3 million vehicles a year at its domestic factories - roughly triple the output at local rivals Nissan and Honda. Among the hurdles Toyota faces in Japan are the strong yen, costly labour regulations, high corporate taxes and an energy policy deadlock that has shut all Japan’s nuclear reactors and driven up costs.As most of the Japanese factories are fully depreciated, closing them and investing in new plant overseas would be even more costly, say some analysts and industry experts.“Toyota has been criticized for having so much production in Japan where the strong yen is such a big disadvantage, but that’s a matter of honor and commitment to keep a certain number of jobs in Japan, not the result of a bad business decision,�� said Jeffrey Liker, a professor at University of Michigan and expert on Toyota’s lean manufacturing system.“The problem from Toyota’s point of view is then defined on reducing costs through other means.”Toyota last month unveiled a new scheme aimed at slashing development costs by more than a fifth, in part by using more shared components. This allows automakers to cut procurement costs on the bits customers don’t see or necessarily appreciate, such as the metal brackets that hold seats in place.Toyota was once considered a benchmark in this, but rivals now look to follow Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE lead in using a wide range of shared parts in both its luxury Audi and mass-market Volkswagen brands.The Japanese firm is also renewing efforts to step up its manufacturing efficiencies - something executives concede fell by the wayside when the company raced to add factory lines to meet soaring demand before the global financial crisis brought growth to a shuddering halt.In the United States, where its reputation for quality with vehicles like the Camry was once unassailable, Toyota is under pressure from Hyundai and the recovering Detroit automakers. Its U.S. sales jumped 12 percent last month - though that’s still nearly a fifth below April 2008 before the financial crisis.“Toyota’s recovery will make the overall auto industry’s competitive landscape tougher this year,�� said Song Sang-hoon, analyst at Kyobo Securities in Seoul. “For Toyota, the big risk factors will be how much the yen could strengthen and the outlook for the U.S. market. It has competitive models from the Camry to the Prius and the Corolla, and how that trio of flagship models can perform will decide its recovery pace.”Toyota forecast current year net profit of 760 billion yen, its best in five years.Toyota shares, valued at more than $134 billion, have gained more than a third since the broad market trough in late-November, outperforming Nissan, Honda, General Motors GM.N, Ford F.N and VW, but lagging BMW BMWG.DE. The main Topix share index .TOPX is up by a tenth over the same period.Toyota closed flat on Wednesday ahead of the earnings in a broader Topix market that fell 1.4 percent.	-5.015518312
Ryan Blaney steals the show in Kentucky 300By Chris Knight, Special to the NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeSPARTA, Ky. -- It wasn’t a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series competitor that the NASCAR Nationwide Series field had to worry about at Kentucky Speedway. Instead, it was a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series standout in Ryan Blaney who stole the show and won Saturday night’s Kentucky 300.Blaney’s first career Nationwide Series win came in his 15th career start and just second start of 2013. Blaney’s triumph in the No. 22 Discount Tire Ford Mustang marked Penske Racing’s 10th win of the year with the No. 22 with four different drivers. A.J. Allmendinger, Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski collectively made up for nine of those victories.The win didn’t come easy for Blaney, a development driver for Penske Racing. Blaney was nearly collected by teammate and current points leader Sam Hornish Jr. on a restart with 15 Laps to go. As Hornish attempted to inherit the lead from Blaney, Hornish’s Ford broke loose on the bottom of the track and immediately walked up the race track, nearly colliding with Blaney. While Hornish faded, Blaney kept his foot on the gas and kept Austin Dillon in his rearview mirror until the caution flag waved a lap later when Parker Kligerman pounded the frontstretch wall after contact with Cole Whitt.In the early stages of the Kentucky 300, Hornish appeared to have the car to beat in his No. 12 Alliance Truck Parts Ford Mustang and even fended off challenges from the RCR duo of Dillon and Brian Scott. But Jeremy Bullins, Blaney’s crew chief, kept making adjustments to his rookie’s blue oval, which allowed the High Point, N.C., native to methodically work his way to the front and overtake Dillon for the lead on Lap 101, just past halfway.Blaney would continue to show the way until Harrison Rhodes brought out the caution for dropping fluid on the race track on Lap 107. The yellow sent the leaders to pit road, where Elliott Sadler opted for a different pit strategy from his competitors and assumed the race lead.Blaney, the son of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Dave Blaney, would rocket by Sadler immediately after the restart and hold the point, until final pit stops occurred with 38 Laps to go following a caution when Brad Sweet crashed on the backstretch. Quick work by the Penske Racing organization allowed the 19 year old to remain first for the series of late-race restarts.On the final restart of the night, Dillon in the No. 3 AdvoCare Chevrolet Camaro attempted to make the pass on Blaney entering Turn 1, but Blaney powered the outside line and pulled ahead from Dillon and the rest of the field over the final nine Laps to net Ford’s 12th win in 27 races.“Yeah, we had a great car all night,�� said a relatively calm, but jubilant Blaney. “We kept working on it throughout the race, just little tweaks here and there. We were really strong to start out the race and just got better and better as the runs went on. It was really tough the last few restarts to really know what was going to happen. The way the restart rule is now, you never know how big of a push someone can get. I was a little worried being on the outside, but we had a great car to be able get through one and two good and be able to clear them by three and four.“I’ve said it before, it really speaks numbers how good this team (really) is. To be able to win with four different drivers. That just shows how strong this 22 group is and how strong Penske Racing is as a whole. I want to thank everyone, who made this opportunity possible.”Dillon, Hornish’s rival for the Nationwide championship finished second, ahead of Richard Childress Racing teammate Matt Crafton in third. Hornish rebounded for fourth, while Alex Bowman in the RAB Racing entry posted his first top-five run since the season-opener at Daytona (Fla.) International Speedway in February.Dillon, the grandson of Richard Childress, failed to record his fourth series victory at the 1.5-mile track, but did however notch his 10th top-five of 2013 and capitalized on his sixth place run at Kentucky in June.“We knew we would be good coming here, it’s one of our better tracks and I’m just thankful we had a good run tonight,�� said Dillon, still winless in his sophomore season. “It was a solid run, there was just one car better. We needed something. Just a little bit more, we were too tight all night on exit and we tried to get it out of the car and (we) just couldn’t. That 22 has been very tough all year long, no matter who’s gotten in it. They’ve won with four different drivers this year. That’s pretty impressive.”When asked about his deficit to Hornish, which now stands at 15 points with less than two months of racing remaining, Dillon remained highly optimistic.“Just let it (points) come to us,�� Dillon said. “We’re going to stay here and keep running hard every week. We have to run top-five from here on out.”Crafton, the current NASCAR Camping World Truck Series points leader, tied his best career finish (third) in NASCAR Nationwide Series competition. Ironically, the driver of the No. 33 Rheem / Menards Chevrolet Camaro also finished third in the tripleheader weekend at the Sparta, Kentucky-based track in June. “We were tight, tight, tight, for most of the race until the last stop. I then got loose, but went back to tight, but I can’t thank Menards, Rheem and RCR for the opportunity. A good night.”Drew Herring taking the reins for Kyle Busch this weekend finished sixth, flanked by Brian Vickers, Jeb Burton in his NASCAR Nationwide Series debut, Cole Whitt driving for Tri-Star Motorsports and Michael Annett comprised the remainder of the top 10.While Blaney has led only 65 Laps in his full-time campaign on the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series tour, he led a race-high 96 laps Saturday night. Blaney last competed on the circuit in June at Iowa Speedway, where he finished ninth after starting sixth.In the race for the owner’s championship, Roger Penske (No. 22) leads J.D. Gibbs (No. 54) by 23 markers.NASCAR Nationwide Series Race - Kentucky 300Kentucky SpeedwaySparta, KentuckySaturday, Sept. 21, 20131. (2) Ryan Blaney(i), Ford, 200, $80800.2.

(Reuters) - Citroen is leaving the world rally championship with immediate effect after six-times world champion Sebastien Ogier announced his departure from the team, the French manufacturer said on Wednesday.Citroen Racing said it had made the decision “due to the absence of a first-class driver available for (the) 2020 season�� but commercial factors were also a major consideration.The motorsport.com website said Ogier was expected to be announced as a Toyota driver on Monday.Toyota’s Estonian Ott Tanak won the driver’s title in Spain last month, ending Ogier’s six-year reign, but announced four days later that he was joining Hyundai for 2020.Hyundai secured the manufacturers�� crown when this month’s season-ending Australian race was called off due to the threat of bushfires.“Our decision to withdraw from WRC program as early as end of 2019 follows on Sebastien Ogier’s choice to leave Citroen Racing,�� said Citroen CEO Linda Jackson.“We obviously have not wished this situation but we could not imagine 2020 season without Sebastien.”Citroen won nine successive drivers�� titles with Sebastien Loeb and Ogier between 2004 and 2012 and eight manufacturers�� championships.This season they and Ogier, who had returned after starting out with Citroen in 2009, ended third overall in both championship standings.The marque had been expected to leave the championship in the coming years anyway, with PSA Group stablemates Peugeot announcing last week their return to the World Endurance Championship in 2022 and the Le Mans 24 Hours in 2023.Citroen’s premium DS brand is also a partner of Envision DS Virgin Racing in the all-electric Formula E series, which is seen as a better fit for the auto industry’s move towards future electrification.Running three top level campaigns was considered too much of a stretch.“When you see how much we need to push for the electrification of our brand and products and the marketing we need to push these cars on sales, it’s really difficult for a brand like Citroen not to focus on this,�� Citroen team boss Pierre Budar told motorsport.com.“And if the sporting discipline cannot help it’s a real problem.”Finland’s Esapekka Lappi, who also drove for Citroen this year, expressed disappointment at the decision.“I’m not going to lie, this is very bad news for me, for us and whole rally family. I feel sorry for the staff and the fans,�� he said on Twitter.“Work has started to find other seat for next years. Not much time but I have a good and strong team around me.��(This story corrects Formula E team to Techeetah, not Envision DS Virgin Racing, in eleventh paragraph)	-0.1266357113
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated a former Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T executive to join the Bank of Japan's split policymaking board, shifting the balance in favor of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's radical stimulus approach.Yukitoshi Funo, a 68-year-old adviser to the auto giant, would replace Yoshihisa Morimoto, a former utility executive who voted against last October’s surprise monetary easing, when his five-year term expires at the end of June.While little is known of Funo’s view on monetary policy, he told Reuters a yen at 80 or above against the dollar was too high back in 2011, when sharp rises in the yen were hurting an economy struck by a devastating earthquake and tsunami.His background as a sales executive at Toyota, which yields strong influence on the government’s exchange-rate policy and backs Abe, may mean Funo will support any future proposals by Kuroda to expand an already massive stimulus, some analysts say.“Given his background, Funo could be sensitive to moves in the yen and overseas markets. He may be supportive of further easing if a strengthening of the yen pressures the BOJ to act,�� said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.Having Funo on the board would ease pressure on Kuroda, who faced a razor-thin 5-4 vote last October, when he pushed through a decision to expand the monetary stimulus after having failed to convince skeptics, including Morimoto.Just weeks ago, Yukata Harada, an academic known for his reflationist views, joined the board, which has been split between Kuroda and his two deputies, who are adamant about meeting inflation targets, and other members, who are cautious of acting again just to accelerate inflation.Analysts say the changes in the board’s composition will give Kuroda enough votes to more comfortably approve further monetary easing from July onward.The government followed the usual practice of naming a business executive to replace a board member who came from business circles.However, it was the first time a person has been nominated from a manufacturer of consumer goods, surprising some in the BOJ due to a potential conflict of interest given Toyota’s history of lobbying policymakers for steps to weaken the yen.A fluent English speaker with an MBA from Columbia University, Funo spent more than a decade working at Toyota’s North American operations, overseeing the automaker’s rapid expansion in its most profitable market.Funo had the trust of President Akio Toyoda while executive vice president at the automaker, where his responsibilities included government and public relations during Toyota’s recall crisis in 2010.Several names, including another academic who held similar views to Kuroda on reflation, were floated as potential candidates before Funo was eventually chosen, say government sources with knowledge of the matter.President Toyoda’s close personal ties with Abe suggests the premier’s views had strong influence in the selection process, the sources said.The nomination must be approved by Diet, though this is a near certainty as Abe’s coalition holds a solid majority in both houses of parliament.Two years into the BOJ’s radical experiment to revive the economy through massive purchases of government bonds and other assets, inflation has ground to a halt and economic growth remains fragile, casting doubt on the central bank’s strategy to pull the country out of decades of deflation.The BOJ will issue its semi-annual report on the economic and price forecasts at its next rate review on April 30. If approved by parliament, Funo will join from July, when the bank will conduct a quarterly review of these projections.	-1.337295691

(Reuters) - Intermittent rain showers caused a spate of minor accidents in the opening four hours of the Le Mans 24-hour race in France on Saturday as Porsche fought Toyota for the early lead.As the circuit began to dry following a second shower and a second ��slow zone�� with safety cars on the track, New Zealander Brendon Hartley set the pace for Porsche ahead of the leading Toyota that had Frenchman Stephane Sarrazin at the wheel.Hartley took over the number 20 Porsche from German Timo Bernhard and traded the lead with Sarrazin as the teams switched between wet and dry tires in out-of-sequence pit stops.Former Formula One driver Mark Webber of Australia is the third man in the Porsche while Sarrazin shares his Toyota with Austrian Alex Wurz and Japanese Kazuki Nakajima who claimed pole for his team on Thursday.The early accidents included a dramatic collision between the number three Audi of Italian Marco Bonanomi with the number eight Toyota of Frenchman Nicolas Lapierre as they ran close together in second and third.The damage caused appeared to have ruled the Audi out of the race but the Toyota continued after repairs in the pits.	3.694968553
"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N needs to get through its ignition-switch recall and the resulting federal investigation quickly to avoid any lasting damage to its brand, but the federal probe could keep the problem in the public eye for at least six months.Analysts and academics warn that a misstep by GM could leave it with a lingering headache, something Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T experienced from 2009 to 2011 with recalls linked to sudden acceleration. The Japanese automaker was criticized for being slow to react to complaints and initially blaming the drivers.GM is currently interviewing employees dating back to the discovery in 2004 of the problem with the ignition switch, which has since been linked to 13 deaths, sources previously said. Meanwhile, U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation into whether the No. 1 U.S. automaker reacted swiftly enough in its recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Tuesday in a letter to GM employees said she deeply regretted the circumstances but was pleased with the company’s response and the focus will be on customer safety and satisfaction.Moving past the recall and related fallout will be critical to ensure the Detroit company continues the rebound since its 2009 bankruptcy reorganization, analysts said.“They need to get past this as quickly as possible,�� said George Cook, a marketing professor at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester.""You cannot be reactive in dealing with the American car-buying public,"" added Cook, formerly an executive at Ford Motor Co F.N for 10 years. ""You have to be proactive and I think they'll be forgiving if it's not really, really serious. People have short memories about that stuff.""GM’s recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off.GM has said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the “run�� position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.The company said last week that the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.Trent Ross, senior vice president of reputation and risk management at Ipsos Public Affairs, said GM needs to take ownership of the issue right away. Several analysts lauded Barra for her letter.“GM needs to show it’s doing the right thing,�� he said. “And Mary Barra has to demonstrate that the buck stops with the CEO.”In her letter to employees, Barra emphasized that whether the company’s reputation and sales suffer is not the issue.“Our company’s reputation won’t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward,�� she said.GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in addition to recall costs it has not outlined. Analysts agreed the big costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.Toyota, for instance, settled economic-loss claims in its case for more than $1 billion and is negotiating settlement of hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits. It also is in talks to settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department for a reported $1 billion.However, that has not hurt sales or stopped Toyota from ranking highly in consumer quality rankings conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, suggesting that any damage to GM could be fleeting, analysts said.GM’s case could take time, however, given the Detroit company’s internal probe and the investigation opened by the NHTSA, which Cook said could last at least six months.Allan Kam, a former enforcement attorney with NHTSA, said the agency’s 107-question “special order�� was unusual. “I’ve never seen one quite as detailed as this one,�� he said.Kam speculated GM would prefer to settle the NHTSA probe in a way that would allow its answers not to be published widely. However, the mounting pressure on NHTSA, with members of Congress sending letters of inquiry, may make that outcome unlikely."	-1.72048703
(Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators said Tuesday that air bag maker Takata Corp declared 5.1 million U.S. vehicles defective, as the company disclosed an 11th death could be linked to a faulty airbag.Most of the vehicles mentioned in numerous previous recalls involving Takata air bags have been older models, but the new recalls include some 2014 models. The Japanese company said newer vehicles remain under “investigation and could be subject to recall at a later date.”The newly released documents show that regulators may prod automakers to recall recent models.That could greatly increase the total number of vehicles recalled, which in the United States now stands at about 24 million involving about 28 million Takata air bag inflators.Ford Motor Co on Tuesday became the first of several automakers involved to announce a recall. A 2006 Ford Ranger was involved in a Dec. 22 crash that killed the driver when a Takata air bag inflator caused the bag to rupture, sending shrapnel into the vehicle.A similar airbag inflator was involved in a fatal rupture of a Honda model in Malaysia in 2014, which prompted a worldwide recall by Honda Motor Co.Takata said in a document released on Tuesday that there was another rupture of a similar inflator in August in India in a 2007 Honda Civic, but it is not clear if the rupture caused the death of the driver. That could be the 11th death worldwide attributed to defective Takata inflators.Nine deaths related to Takata air bags have occurred in the United States. The death in the Ford Ranger is the first not to involve a car made by Honda.U.S. regulators from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Friday that the expanded recall was imminent.The automakers involved in the new Takata inflator recalls include Honda, BMW AG, Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE Volkswagen and Audi brands, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and Sprinter van brands, Mazda Motor Corp, and Saab AB.Toyota Motor Corp is listed by Takata as part of the new recall, but the company said all of its vehicles involved were recalled in 2015.NHTSA did not make clear how many, and which automakers were involved with recalls for 2014 models.The Ford recall announced on Tuesday includes 391,354 2004-2006 Ford Rangers built in North America for driver-side air bags.The Rangers recalled were previously recalled for potentially defective passenger-side air bag inflators, Ford said.Honda has previously recalled about 6.28 million vehicles in the United States for air bag inflators, a Honda spokesman said. Honda worldwide has recalled vehicles with 23 million Takata air bag inflators since 2008 - not counting the latest recall.	-8.827610128
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan’s Sanfrecce Hiroshima beat part-timers Auckland City 1-0 in the opening game of the Club World Cup on Thursday when FIFA used goal-line technology for the first time.Toshihiro Aoyama’s dipping drive in the 66th minute lit up a pedestrian encounter and sent the J-League champions into the quarter-finals where they will face Egypt’s Al-Ahly.The match was the first in which soccer’s governing body officially used the goal technology although there was little opportunity to test its effectiveness in a game of few chances.FIFA are using two systems in Yokohama and Toyota City after finally bowing to calls to eliminate ‘ghost�� goals from the game.GoalRef, which uses a microchip coil in the ball and low magnetic waves around the goal, was used in Thursday’s game with no problems reported.FIFA said pre-match tests conducted by the referee at both ends of the pitch 100 minutes before kickoff were successful.Hawk-Eye, widely used in cricket and tennis, will be used in Sunday’s quarter-finals in Toyota.FIFA will be given analyses from the competing companies in January and decide which system to use at next year’s Confederations Cup in Brazil.The technology was not needed as Hiroshima eased past the New Zealanders in Yokohama, although Yojiro Takahagi and Ryota Moriwaki hit the woodwork from long distance after the break.The Japanese side dominated the game without providing any real threat inside the box.Dethroned European champions Chelsea and South American Libertadores Cup holders Corinthians join the seven-team competition at the semi-final stage next week.“The score was only 1-0 but we tried to keep attacking,�� Hiroshima manager Hajime Moriyasu told reporters. “There was plenty of motivation and effort.”Auckland coach Ramon Tribulietx put a positive spin on the result. “We have to be happy with the way we played,�� he said. “Don’t forget we are an amateur side - it’s not easy coming up here to play Hiroshima in Japan.��	10.95238095
TOKYO (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T said quarterly profit plunged by almost a third on slumping car demand in India, its biggest market, and Japanese automaker slashed its full-year vehicle sales outlook.After decades of robust growth, India’s auto sector has been in a tailspin, hit hard by a liquidity crunch at the country’s shadow banks that has squeezed financing for car sales as well as by higher taxes and a weak rural economy.“We no longer think that growth in India will be an uninterrupted move upwards,�� President Toshihiro Suzuki told an earnings briefing.“We anticipate hills and valleys, so we need to focus on recovering from the current valley we’re in to ensure sustainable growth.”Operating profit for Japan’s fourth-largest automaker tumbled 32% to 55.9 billion yen ($514 million) in the July-September quarter from the same period a year earlier. A drop in domestic output due to the need to improve its inspection processes after a mileage scandal also hurt.That was its weakest level in nearly three years but it exceeded an average forecast for 44.9 billion yen from nine analysts according to Refinitiv data.Suzuki, which accounts for roughly half of India's passenger vehicles through its majority stake in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS, sold just 305,000 vehicles in India in the quarter, down 32% and its lowest quarterly sales since the December 2014 quarter. It now expects its India vehicles sales to slide by a fifth this business year. That compares with its previous forecast of a 4% rise.Suzuki last month cut its estimate for full-year operating profit by 40% to 200 billion yen, a four-year low and a long way off its record high of 374.2 billion yen hit in the business year ended in March 2018.For a link to an interactive graphic on Suzuki's operating profit, click on tmsnrt.rs/2LSSGXBGlobally, Suzuki posted quarterly sales of 670,000 vehicles, down around 20% from a year ago. It currently expects annual global sales of 2.85 million units, down 15% from an earlier forecast.Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T announced in August they would take small equity stakes in each other as they try to leverage their combined scale to manage costs and boost development of new vehicle technologies.	1.485007816
HONG KONG, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd, a car manufacturing venture partner of Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, said it might only achieve 80 to 90 percent of the actual profit it had forecast for 2011.In a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Thursday, the company said profit had been affected by unexpected external factors such as the earthquake in Japan, slowing economic growth and floods in Thailand, which caused parts shortages.Sales volume in the second half of 2011 was lower than expected due to the overall downturn in the automobile industry, it added.For statement click hereThe company in March last year forecast 2011 profit would reach 5.03 billion yuan ($798.20 million), up from 4.33 billion yuan in 2010.

DETROIT (Reuters) - EcoMotors, a Michigan-based engine maker backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, has formed a joint venture in China with a subsidiary of First Auto Works.The FAW subsidiary, First Auto Works Jingye Engine Company, is investing more than $200 million in the venture, BEM (Shanxi) Co, which aims to begin building an advanced engine designed by EcoMotors in 2015 in China’s Shanxi province.FAW's manufacturing partners in China include Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and General Motors CoGM.N.It is the second China venture for EcoMotors, a suburban Detroit startup, which announced a similar deal last April with China’s Zhongding Power. The privately held Chinese firm plans to ramp up production this year in Anhui province, supplying engines for use in commercial and off-road vehicles.Both China ventures will build EcoMotors�� OPOC engine, which is more compact than conventional gas and diesel engines of similar power.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global sales at Japanese automakers slipped 12.2% in July from last year, the fifth straight month of losses, as demand for cars remains sluggish after factories and dealerships reopened following coronavirus-related lockdowns earlier this year.The country's seven major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, sold a combined 2.01 million vehicles last month, according to Reuters calculations based on sales data released by the companies on Friday. The decline in monthly sales has slowed significantly since a 50% drop posted in April, and compared with a 21.3% fall in June. Sales in China increased on the year for most automakers, while Toyota, the country’s biggest automaker, also saw growth in Europe.Total global production at Japan’s seven major automakers fell 14.4% year-on-year to 1.99 million units last month, improving from a 26.1% tumble in June.Global demand for cars has been weak since March due to virus-related stay-at-home orders in many countries, which led to a drop in visits to car dealerships and potential customers also reconsidered big purchases.Many countries have been easing the lockdown restrictions, but industry experts anticipate that it could take up to five years for demand to recover to 2019 levels.	1.560633214
(The following statement was released by the rating agency)June 29 - Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services today assigned its ‘A-1�� short-term corporate credit rating to Japan-based general trading company (GTC) Toyota Tsusho Corp. and its ‘A-1�� short-term debt rating to the company’s JPY300 billion domestic currency commercial paper (CP) program. In addition, we affirmed our ‘A�� long-term corporate credit and debt ratings on Toyota Tsusho. The outlook on the long-term corporate credit rating is stable. We base the ‘A-1�� ratings on the company and CP program on the ‘A�� long-term corporate credit rating and our view that the company has adequate liquidity.The ratings on Toyota Tsusho reflect the company’s stable earnings and good asset quality--both of which stem from its position as the trading arm of the Toyota Motor Corp. (AA-/Negative/A-1+) group--and our expectations that the company will generate stronger profits and diversify through expansion of its nonauto businesses in the medium term. The company’s low risk appetite, stringent risk management, and conservative financial policy make material deterioration in its financial risk profile unlikely, in our opinion. We also consider the company strategically important to Toyota Motor. At the same time, cash flow-related measures for Toyota Tsusho are weak for the current ratings, and we view this as a constraint on the ratings.We view Toyota Tsusho’s liquidity as adequate under our criteria, with sources of liquidity likely to exceed 1.2x uses for the next two years. As of March 31, 2012, the company had about JPY365 billion in cash and deposits, short of the JPY487 billion it owed in short-term debt. Nevertheless, the company’s short-term debt mainly comprised of short-term loans, which it typically refinances on an ongoing basis with, in our opinion, very limited refinancing risk. This practice is quite common between corporations and financial institutions in Japan. Backed by the creditworthiness of the Toyota group, Toyota Tsusho maintains firm relationships with its creditor banks, and we believe its liquidity risk is very limited.2008 Corporate Criteria: Analytical Methodology, April 15, 2008Methodology: Short-Term/Long-Term Ratings Linkage Criteria For Corporate And Sovereign Issuers, May 15, 20122008 Corporate Criteria: Commercial Paper, April 15, 2008Toyota Tsusho Corp.New Ratings RatingShort-term corporate credit rating A-1Commercial paper rating A-1Ratings Affirmed RatingLong-term corporate credit rating A/StableSenior unsecured debt rating A	-5.874282864
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Global equities markets, rattled by the coronavirus epidemic, are now getting further destabilised by human error. Monday’s dramatic 30% plunge in oil prices, plus signs of viral panic in Italy, pushed some major Asian indexes down as much as 6%, reversed a Chinese stock rally, and set off destabilising yen appreciation. The flight to safety is starting to look ominous.After a long period of complacency about Covid-19, a move to cut risk exposure has got belatedly underway, pushing down stock values and inflating gold prices. But now monetary and political mistakes are compounding the selloff.For example, last week’s rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, intended to restore confidence, had the opposite effect. Italy’s initial inability to control the outbreak has led the government to implement an aggressive quarantine that could impact 16 million people �� and raises the prospect that drastic methods that inhibit supply and demand could extend into the rest of Europe and beyond. Oil prices were bound to fall after Friday’s failure to reach an agreement on supply cuts within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but Saudi has now signalled for a full-fledged price war by slashing its own rates.The question is what it will take to stop the bleeding. While cheap oil has some upsides for many large economies including Japan and India, it is also a leading indicator of softening global demand, and 30% of East Asia’s GDP comes from exports, per World Bank data.Local currencies have also been thrown off by the Fed move. The yen, for example, has gained a whopping 10% since Feb. 20, touching 101.6 per U.S. dollar in morning trade, its strongest position since 2016. That’s terrible news for earnings at Japanese exporters, in particular carmakers like Toyota and Nissan. A weak dollar is a headache for other Asian economies too, including China.Central banks have limited room to help. Nearly a decade of monetary expansion has reduced the returns from additional liquidity. Those already with negative rates have little room to move. Fiscal spending is way forward, but it’s not easy to paper over panic with handouts. Politicians will have to be creative, convincing and move fast.	0.610798925

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it was recalling all of the roughly 2,800 zero-emission Mirai cars on the road due to problems with the output voltage generated by their fuel cell system.Toyota said that under unique driving conditions, such as if the accelerator pedal is depressed to the wide open throttle position after driving on a long descent while using cruise control, there was a possibility the output voltage generated by the fuel cell boost converter could exceed the maximum voltage.To date, Toyota has sold about 2,840 Mirai cars in Japan, the United States and some markets in Europe, as well as the United Arab Emirates.Toyota dealers will update the fuel cell system software at no cost to the customer, it said. The process will take about half an hour, it said.Toyota first began selling the hydrogen-fueled Mirai in December 2014 in Japan, its home market, in a bid to lead the industry in the nascent technology. Toyota has promoted fuel cell vehicles as the most sensible next-generation option to hybrids, although a lack of hydrogen fuelling stations remains a major hurdle for mass consumption.	-1.23228589
PARIS (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan’s new gasoline-electric hybrid technology would be competitive in Europe, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on Thursday, as carmakers turn away from diesel for smaller vehiclesThe “e-Power�� transmission, announced a day earlier by Renault’s alliance partner Nissan for the Note subcompact car in Japan, amounts to an electric vehicle powered by a small gasoline generator instead of a large battery.Carmakers are racing into electrification as Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE emissions test-cheating scandal hastens diesel's decline and stiffens regulatory resolve. Renault and Toyota are among those signaling a faster retreat from diesel in small cars.Although not emissions-free, e-Power’s smaller battery makes it significantly cheaper than electric-only cars and never needs recharging. Fuel economy figures suggest that the carbon dioxide output compares well with traditional hybrid minis such as the Toyota Yaris.“It’s definitely cost-competitive with diesel,�� Ghosn said on Thursday, adding that the new technology “absolutely�� would be viable for the European mass-market. Ghosn, who heads both carmakers, was speaking to Reuters at the New York Times Energy for Tomorrow conference in Paris.A Nissan spokeswoman said: “There are no current plans for e-Power in Europe. But the technology can be adapted to other markets and (vehicle categories), so we wouldn’t rule it out.”Renault-Nissan is not alone in using combustion engine generators to power electric cars.They have featured aboard Chevrolet’s 2011 Volt electric car and as a range-extending option for BMW’s i3. PSA, the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS vehicles, is building electric prototypes with single-cylinder generators from Israeli start-up Aquarius Engines.Nissan said that Japanese prices for its e-Power Note will start at 1.77 million yen ($17,140), a 27 percent premium over the basic gasoline version. That is comparable with the extra outlay for a diesel option in European cars such as the VW Polo.The e-Power Note’s stated fuel economy of 37.2 km per liter, based on Japanese regulatory test standards, suggests CO2 emissions of about 62 grammes/km. Toyota’s Yaris hybrid emits 75 g/km in European testing.Renault-Nissan aims to market a battery-only vehicle in China for as little as $7,000 to $8,000 after government incentives, Ghosn also said on Thursday.	6.331403763

On Wednesday, it eclipsed VW's $99.4 billion value.Toyota still holds pole position with a market cap of $233 billion.The recent gains have been fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth.But the gains highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla’s shift from a niche car maker into a global leader in cleaner cars.A glance at its results shows it has a long way to go before it can eclipse larger rivals.Based on 12-month forward sales estimates, it doesn’t even appear in the top 20 in the world.

TOKYO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has developed a way to make hybrid and electric vehicles without the use of expensive rare earth metals, in which China has a near-monopoly, Japan’s Kyodo News reported.Toyota, the world’s top producer of fuel-saving hybrid cars such as the Prius, could bring the technology to market in two years if the price of rare earths does not come down, Kyodo said, citing a source familiar with the matter.A Toyota spokeswoman said the company continues to research ways to reduce rare earth usage and has no time frame yet for commercialisation.Rare earth metals like neodymium and dysprosium are used in the powerful magnets in motors that power hybrid and electric cars, and demand is expected to surge as more of the environmentally friendly cars hit the market.China produces more than 95 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. Its efforts to limit exports, citing resource depletion and environmental degradation, have alarmed its customers and trading partners and have sent prices soaring.Japan accounts for a third of global rare earth demand and is aiming to cut consumption, providing subsidies for recycling and investing in new ways to limit their use.	16.23116273

Nov 6 (Reuters) �� Toyota’s sparkling earnings show how Abenomics may be good for Japanese companies now, but perhaps a bust for investing in Japan over the long term.Toyota, the world’s biggest car maker, reported a 70 percent jump in profits last quarter, as it got a boost from this year’s 12 percent drop in the yen against the dollar .A look under the hood, however, shows that Toyota’s gains may not translate into the sustained expansion Japan hopes Abenomics will spark. Named after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Abenomics is an attempt to use government spending, radical monetary policy and competitive reform to finally rescue Japan from a 20-year-plus slump.The first step was to hammer the yen lower, making Japanese exporters more globally competitive. A weaker yen has helped Toyota, but not perhaps in the way policymakers want.Two things have to happen for Abenomics to succeed. First, external demand prompted by a weaker yen needs to drive a self-sustaining consumer expansion. That requires wage gains.Second, companies need to invest and expand, using a new pricing advantage from the yen to build volume, not simply to make more money on every car sold.On the evidence thus far, neither of the two needed things is happening or is likely to happen.Consider Toyota. While profits are up 70 percent, most of the focus is on increasing margins, with capital expenditure forecast to rise just 2 percent and research and development forecast to stay the same.That’s hardly the massive expansion Japan needs.And while Toyota, and others, have indicated a willingness to boost wages in the future if profits continue to roll in, thus far they’ve been far more likely to hand out bonuses rather than make permanent increases in their fixed costs.It looks very much, in other words, as if Toyota, and likely many other companies, are happy to increase profit margins but not take on the risks of paying more and expanding rapidly. Given the history of the auto industry and Japan itself, it is hard to blame them.Japanese workers, having lived through the past 20 years, are understandably wary about increasing spending permanently based on a one-off bonus.And while Abe said in October that higher wages were “vital�� and has used various forums to pressure companies, even corporate tax cuts haven’t had much of an effect. A recent Reuters corporate survey found that only 5 percent of respondents would use additional savings to raise wages.This leaves Japanese workers in a difficult bind. Prices are rising at last, at least a bit, but wages not so much.Core consumer prices, which include oil products but not fresh food, rose 0.7 percent in the year to September. Even so-called ‘core-core�� prices, which excludes both food and energy, were flat, the first time since 2008 that they have not fallen.While that might seem like cause for rejoicing, wages have been stagnant. Salaries are in their longest slide since 2010, with regular wages excluding overtime and bonuses down 0.3 percent in September. Total cash earnings rose 0.1 percent.Minutes of the Bank of Japan’s October meeting, recently released, showed some disquiet over the pace of wage gains, with one member noting that sustained gains might not appear before the annual wage negotiation round next April. Except then a consumption tax will increase by 3 percentage points, almost certainly more than swamping any wage increases.The fear, of course, is that consumers won’t consume, and when next April’s consumption tax comes along, Japan will drift back into deflation and recession. And remember, Japan, as a country with very large debts and a demographic downward path, needs inflation. Only inflation, and genuine growth, will allow it to manage its debts over the longer term.Here again we have a great example of how extraordinary monetary policy creates risks for everyone while handing out what may be short-term benefits disproportionately to the wealthy. The Nikkei 225 stock index is up by a third this year, and by 50 percent over the past year. Profits among exporters are, by and large, growing quite well.Even those gains may prove to be short-lived, and taking a five-year view, investors would be wise to be very cautious about the future of Abenomics and Japanese assets.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - PTT Global Chemical Pcl, Thailand’s largest petrochemical producer, on Tuesday announced a $4 billion investment plan over the next five years in an industrial development on the eastern seaboard.It includes a polyols joint venture between PTTGC, Sanyo Chemical Industries and Toyota Tsusho Corp in Thailand’s eastern province of Rayong, it said.The investment plan also includes a naphtha cracker plant at the existing PTTGC facility in Map Ta Phut which will put production capacity at 500,000 tons per year for ethylene and 250,000 tons per year for propylene.PTTGC also signed an agreement with Japanese Kuraray Co and Sumitomo Corp to study the possibility of producing High-Heat Resistant Polyamide-9T and Hydrogenated Styenic Block Copolymer.	5.805677043
(Updates to specify first passenger car plant, adds details on Mexico announcement)TOKYO, April 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it will build new factories in Mexico and China, ending a self-imposed expansion freeze and putting more pressure on global rivals.The world’s largest automaker by sales volume said it would build a $1 billion plant with an annual capacity of 200,000 cars in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, increasing its overall North American production capacity by about the same number of vehicles.That plant, Toyota’s first passenger car plant in Mexico, would have about 2,000 workers, the company said.The highly anticipated announcement comes amid a flurry of new auto investments in Mexico, as carmakers are drawn to its low labor costs, free trade agreements and proximity to the United States.Since the beginning of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration in December 2012, auto investments have reached over $20 billion dollars, Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said at Toyota’s announcement in Mexico City on Wednesday.The new Mexico plant will be the first built from the ground up under the Toyota New Global Architecture strategy, the automaker’s new approach to engineering and building vehicles, Jim Lentz, head of Toyota’s North American operations, said in an interview on Wednesday.Toyota said investment for the Guanajuato plant would likely be about 40 percent less than comparable investments in 2008. The Guanajuato site will be a model for other factories globally, Lentz said.Toyota plans to move production of its Corolla compact car to the new Mexican plant in 2019 from a factory in Cambridge, Ontario.The Canadian plant will get a new product, Lentz said, as part of a realignment of Toyota’s North American manufacturing that will concentrate production of low-margin, small cars in Mexico and at a Mississippi factory currently building the Corolla.Toyota plants in Canada and the central United States will focus on larger, expensive cars and sport utilities. Pickup truck production will remain in Texas and Mexico, Lentz said.In China, Toyota said it would spend about 52.5 billion yen ($440 million) to add a new facility and a third line at its factory in Guangzhou, owned jointly with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd. The line could start production in 2017 with capacity to make about 100,000 cars a year.Wednesday’s moves officially end Toyota President Akio Toyoda’s three-year moratorium on capacity expansion, and increase pressure on the automaker’s rivals, including Volkswagen AG and Detroit automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.Toyota’s sales took a hit during the 2007-09 recession and a 2010 recall scandal. Toyota says it is now using about 90 percent of its total manufacturing capacity compared with about 70 percent in 2009.With the new Mexican plant, Lentz said: “We’ve expanded as much as we need to at this point.�� ($1 = 119.49 yen) (Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall, Joseph White, and Joanna Zuckerman Bernstein.; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Joseph White, Paul Simao and Andre Grenon)	0.3237875953

(Adds annualized selling rate result of 17.8 million vehicles)DETROIT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry powered ahead in August, topping sales estimates and shrugging off gyrating stock markets as consumers continued to show their penchant for pickup trucks and SUVs.U.S. auto sales were the strongest in any month since July 2005. The annualized selling rate in August was 17.8 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp, well above expectations of 17.3 million.The six largest automakers in the U.S. market all beat the sales forecasts of industry analysts, with Toyota, Honda, Nissan and GM reporting declines that were not as severe as expected.Roller-coaster stock markets appeared to have no major impact on auto purchases, which each month are an early indicator of consumer spending.“All of the economic fundamentals that we look at, including job growth, disposable income and fuel prices, are in good shape and that should keep sales strong,�� said Kurt McNeil, head of U.S. sales for General Motors Co.Bill Fay, head of Toyota brand sales in the U.S. market, pointed out that U.S. consumer confidence in August was at its highest since January.GM, the No. 1 automaker in the U.S. market, reported that sales dropped 0.7 percent.Ford Motor Co, the No. 2 U.S. automaker by vehicle sales, showed a gain of 5 percent, easily outdistancing expectations.Toyota Motor Corp , No. 3 in U.S. sales, reported an 8.8 percent decline in August.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV showed a rise of 2 percent, boosted by Jeep SUVs. Analysts had been looking for a decline in FCA sales.Honda Motor Co reported a drop of 7 percent and Nissan Motor Co a 1 percent dip.August industry sales were expected to be down largely based on a quirk in the calendar that put results over the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend into September sales.Although Labor Day is always in September, the U.S. auto industry usually counts the sales in August results.Ford said sales of its F-Series pickup trucks topped 70,000 for the first time this year - at 71,332, up 4.7 percent.Mark LeNeve, head of Ford’s U.S. sales, said Ford SUV and truck sales both rose about 12 percent while car sedan sales fell 7 percent.GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks together outsold Ford’s F-Series, at more than 76,000. Silverado sales rose 11.7 percent and Sierra sales were up 7 percent.	2.644108145
(Adds Toyota comment)March 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc, the new holding company for Google, has put Boston Dynamics, part of its robotics division, up for sale for lack of revenue potential, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the plans.The possible buyers include Amazon.com Inc and Toyota Research Institute, Toyota Motor Corp's research and development company, according to Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/1R69KAK)Boston Dynamics, bought by Alphabet in 2013, is best known for building robots that look as if they belong in a science-fiction movie and are often co-developed or funded by the U.S. military.Boston Dynamic’s products include Cheetah, which it claims to be world’s fastest legged robot as well as RiSE, a robot that climbs vertical terrains such as walls, trees and fences.Amazon has installed thousands of robots across its warehouses to cut operating costs and get packages out the door more quickly.Toyota Research said in January it had hired a team of scientists and engineers to help drive research into artificial intelligence and robots.Toyota declined to comment, while Alphabet and Amazon couldn’t be immediately reached.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Chinese suppliers and manufacturers have stepped up their presence at the Frankfurt auto show, capitalizing on a strong position in electric technologies forced on European carmakers by regulators seeking to curb pollution.Though the number of exhibitors has fallen to 800 in 2019 from 994 in 2017, Chinese automakers and suppliers now make up the biggest foreign contingent, with 79 companies, up from 73.Several European and Japanese carmakers including Fiat FCHA.MI, Alfa Romeo, Nissan 7291.T and Toyota 7203.T have skipped the show as the industry cuts costs.Europe’s automakers face multibillion-euro investments to develop electric and autonomous cars, forcing them to rely on Chinese companies for key technologies such as lithium ion battery cell production, an area where Asian suppliers dominate.German firms are striking major deals with Chinese suppliers to help them meet stringent EU anti-pollution rules, which were introduced in the wake of Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE 2015 emissions cheating scandal.""All carmakers face the challenge that they will have to fulfill fleet consumption targets,"" Matthias Zentgraf, regional president for Europe at China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) 300750.SZ, told Reuters.Zentgraf said he expected further supply deals to be struck in Europe this year following agreements with BMW BMWG.DE and Volkswagen.Daimler DAIGn.DE on Wednesday said it had chosen China-backed Farasis Energy to supply battery cells for its Mercedes-Benz electrification push.Farasis is building a 600 million euro ($663 million) factory in east Germany, close to where Chinese rival CATL is erecting a 1.8 billion euro battery plant.SVOLT Energy Technology, which was carved out of China's Great Wall Motor Co 601633.SS2333.HK, told Reuters it would start building battery cells in Europe at a new 2 billion euro plant in 2023.Chinese companies are also giving Europe more attention since the United States and China embarked on a global trade war, which has resulted in tariffs.“We put Europe up in priority,�� said Daniel Kirchert, chief executive of Chinese electric car maker Byton.“We are at a tipping point�� for acceptance of electric vehicles in Europe, Kirchert, a former BMW executive, added.Byton has taken its prototype vehicles on road shows in Europe, and received expressions of interest from 20,000 customers, he said. In electric vehicle hot spots, such as Norway and the Netherlands, “we see a very positive response.”Byton plans to export vehicles from its factory in Nanjing, to Europe in 2021, Kirchert said, adding that exporting to the United States would be a challenge if Washington and Beijing did not resolve their trade war.He said Byton still hoped to launch in the United States in 2021, but tariffs would threaten the company’s goal of selling vehicles at a starting price of about $45,000.“We decided no matter what�� Byton will launch in the United States, even at a higher price, he said.China’s Great Wall Motor may consider building car manufacturing facilities in the European Union once its sales there hit 50,000 units a year, its chairman told Reuters at the show.German carmakers have been forced to accelerate electrification plans after the EU imposed a 37.5% cut in carbon dioxide emissions between 2021 and 2030 in addition to a 40% cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021.PSA Group PEUP.PA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares used the show to step up criticism of Europe's aggressive approach toward emissions limits. “The word dialogue has become meaningless in Europe,�� he said, referring to the requirements placed on the auto industry.“Politicians can decide rules without any discussion with industry,�� he told journalists on the sidelines of the show.Electric cars made up only 1.5% of global sales last year, or 1.26 million of the 86 million passenger vehicles sold, JATO Dynamics said.If carmakers fail to meet the 2021 targets they could face a combined 33 billion euros in fines, analysts at Evercore ISI have estimated.They also estimate it will cost the auto industry an aggregate 15.3 billion euros to comply, assuming a 60 euro cost per gram to reduce CO2 emissions for premium carmakers and 40 euros per gram of CO2 reduction for volume manufacturers."	-0.530230503

BEIJING, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two Chinese joint ventures sold about 91,100 vehicles in China in September, up 26.1 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Wednesday.That followed an 8.9 percent year-on-year rise in August and a 1.1 percent fall in July. In the first nine months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker by sales volume sold about 710,300 vehicles in China, up 11.5 percent from a year earlier.Toyota this year aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China. If accomplished, this would see the carmaker surpass annual sales of 1 million vehicles in China for the first time, a target it originally aimed for in 2010. Last year, Toyota sold 917,500 vehicles in China.A Beijing-based company spokesman, Takanori Yokoi, said Toyota is on track to meet the target. “There is no change in that,�� Yokoi said.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group .

(Recasts to lead with NFL comments)Oct 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Football League will be closely watching the audience for Yahoo Inc’s global webcast of a game on Sunday as it considers whether to do more deals to live stream games, an NFL official told Reuters Thursday.Yahoo will stream Sunday’s game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars, the first time viewers around the world can watch an NFL game online for free. It kicks off in London at 2:30 p.m., or 9:30 a.m. EDT.The NFL will be taking a close look at not just how many viewers watch the game, but also what kind of devices they use to watch it, the quality of the viewing experience and whether the game draws a larger share of millennial viewers and how they are using social media to talk about the game, said Vishal Shah, the NFL’s vice president of digital media strategy.It also will study viewership in various regions, he said. The game will take place in prime time in Asian markets.“All distribution formats are on the table�� for future games and other content where rights are available, he said. “How we distribute live games can take a lot of shapes.”The NFL and Yahoo declined to comment on viewership goals.Over the past few months, Yahoo dropped its asking price for advertisements during the game from $200,000 to less than $100,000, two media buyers familiar with the situation told Reuters. Yahoo is guaranteeing advertisers 3.5 million streams in the United States, the buyers said.Yahoo declined to comment on ad costs.“We are completely sold out on ads,�� Lisa Utzschneider, Yahoo’s chief revenue officer, told Reuters in an interview, adding that more than 30 brands had signed up to advertise, including Toyota Motor Corp, Microsoft Corp and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV . Dairy Queen ice cream is the pre-game sponsor and Toyota Motor Corp is the half-time sponsor.While the opportunity to advertise during the game may be attractive to global brands, it is less so for U.S. brands because the game is early for West Coast viewers, and fans in the game’s local markets will be able to view it on television on CBS affiliates, the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because the negotiations were confidential, told Reuters.Still, advertisers are interested to see how many viewers tune in and if the game results in additional partnerships between the NFL and Yahoo or its competitors.Advertisers had the option to target spots domestically or globally, meaning viewers in London, for example, may see different ads than viewers in New York, Utzschneider said.

* $5,000 price cut on 2014 Chevrolet Volt* Smart Fortwo Electric lease drops to $139 a month* Popular and pricy Tesla Model S bucks the trendDETROIT, Aug 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Daimler AG on Tuesday amped up the electric-car price war, announcing significant price cuts aimed at boosting demand in a still-sluggish segment of the U.S. auto market.GM slashed $5,000 from the price of its 2014 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, while Daimler announced a steeply discounted monthly lease price of $139 on its 2013 Smart Fortwo Electric Drive.Plug-in vehicles such as the gasoline-electric Volt and the pure-electric Fortwo ED have encountered stiff resistance from U.S. consumers, in part because of their higher prices and lack of a nationwide battery charging network.U.S. sales of plug-in electric and gasoline-electric vehicles through July totaled only 48,889, according to research firm Autodata. That represents just 0.5 percent of total U.S. vehicle sales of 9.1 million in the first seven months of this year.The $5,000 cut for the 2014 Volt will lower the price to $34,995, including delivery fees but before federal tax credits.Smart is offering U.S. dealers a $2,000 wholesale rebate on the 2013 Fortwo ED, effectively lowering the retail price to $23,750. Customers also can opt to lease the tiny battery-powered two-seater for $139 a month for 36 months, with $1,995 down, a 30 percent discount from the previous monthly lease rate of $199.Smart has delivered only 173 Fortwo EDs to U.S. customers this year. The brand began offering an upgraded electric motor and battery pack in May and will start selling 2014 models in October. A redesigned Fortwo ED is expected for the 2015 model year.Even before the latest price cut, the Volt has been one of the best-selling plug-in vehicles, with 11,643 U.S. sales through July.That is roughly the same number as the battery-powered Nissan Leaf, which has benefited from a hefty $6,000 price cut in January. Including shipping, the 2013 Leaf retails for $29,650.Both the Volt and the Leaf, however, have been outsold by the pricy Tesla Model S, which starts at nearly $71,000 and accounted for one-quarter of all U.S. plug-in sales through July with 12,200.Other electric-car competitors have also followed Nissan’s lead with steep discounts.In May, Honda Motor Co slashed the lease price of its Fit EV subcompact by one-third, to $259 a month. In July, Ford Motor Co reduced the price of its 2014 Focus Electric compact by 10 percent, to $35,995.GM previously had cut the price of the 2013 Volt by $5,000 to help boost demand. In late May, it launched an electric version of the Chevy Spark subcompact with a lower-than-expected starting price of $27,495 and is offering discounted leases on both cars.The Volt price cut is another step in GM’s effort to seize the mantle of “greenest automaker in the world�� from Toyota Motor Corp , which makes the popular Prius hybrid car. Toyota also sells a plug-in version of the Prius.GM did not quantify the cost savings for the 2014 Volt, but has said the next version, due in 2015 or 2016, will cost $7,000 to $10,000 less. The 2014 models will begin arriving at U.S. dealers later this month.GM is aiming by 2017 to build up to 500,000 vehicles a year with some form of electric power. The vehicles would include the Volt, the Spark EV and those with its eAssist system that boosts fuel efficiency in gas-powered cars.GM will begin building the Cadillac ELR plug-in electric coup late this year.	-1.575729069
* About 1,600 workers at Kentucky plant are eligible* Toyota expects 20-25 pct of eligible workers to take offer* Company aims to manage attrition, labor costs to declineNov 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it is offering retirement incentives to about 2,000 U.S. workers, or 10 percent of its employees in the country, in an effort to manage attrition of its aging work force.About 1,600 workers at the Japanese automaker’s Georgetown, Kentucky plant, or about a quarter of the work force there, are eligible, Toyota spokesman Mike Goss said.The rest of the eligible employees work at plants and offices throughout the United States, he said.“We’re trying to spread out the impact of the attrition over some time as opposed to the risk of them all walking away at the same time,�� Goss said.Toyota began hiring people in Kentucky 25 years ago and the plant opened in 1988. The factory builds the Camry sedan, Venza crossover vehicle and Avalon large sedan.The automaker employs about 20,000 people in the United States, including about 6,600 at the Georgetown plant that began production in 1988 and has an annual production capacity of 500,000 vehicles. Goss said they expect about 20 percent to 25 percent of those eligible to take the offer.Employees who work 25 years at Toyota qualify for retirement with full medical benefits, pension and 401k pay, he said. The offer is also being made, however, to those who have worked at the company 22 years or more, and includes the ability for employees to purchase the years needed to qualify for full retirement. Goss declined to say what it costs for employees to purchase those years.Under the offer, each worker will get a lump-sum payment equal to two weeks pay for every year of service, up to 25 years, plus eight additional weeks of pay, Goss said. In return, the workers would agree to leave on a schedule set by the company.Toyota’s plant employees are not unionized, but receive similar pay and benefits as those represented at General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group LLC by the United Auto Workers. Chrysler is controlled by Italy’s Fiat.The retirement offer also will allow Toyota to reduce manufacturing labor costs as veteran workers typically earn about $26 an hour, compared with starting pay of around $16 an hour.The retirement incentive offer was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal.	8.860611721
NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is testing a new type of advertising by running the first commercial designed to be viewed within USA Today’s new virtual reality program.The ad for Toyota’s 2017 Camry will debut Thursday when it sponsors the first episode of “VRtually There,�� said the show’s creator, Gannett Co Inc’s USA Today. The show, announced in March, can be seen on USA Today apps and YouTube with a VR headset such as Alphabet Inc’s Google Cardboard.Each episode will last about five to seven minutes and mostly feature inspirational and adventure stories, Niko Chauls, director of applied technologies for the USA Today Network, said in an interview.Virtual reality, the panoramic technology with roots in gaming, is still in its infancy and has yet to go mainstream. Content makers such as Gannett and advertisers are trying to figure out how to make money with virtual reality content and advertising.Gannett wanted to be a pioneer in virtual reality and set the standard for ads in the emerging technology, Chauls said.Chauls dubbed Toyota’s ad a “cubemercial,�� because viewers see visuals as though they are placed on four walls around them with blank space when one turns their head toward the floor and ceiling.More brands will advertise in upcoming episodes, said Kelly Andresen, Gannett’s vice president of branded content. She declined to provide additional details.To tap potential revenue streams, Gannett’s bet on virtual reality is part of an expansion beyond the declining print business. The company is testing new digital content and ad formats, while making acquisitions in the newspaper business to expand its footprint.After the premiere, the new show will air at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) every Thursday.Gannett’s first show features three segments with adventure and travel experiences such as the landing of an F18 carrier and the annual hot air balloon festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico.The show can be accessed through the USA Today app, the USA Today Network’s VR Stories app and on the “VRtually There�� YouTube channel, USA Today said. Those who do not have VR headsets can watch the show on mobile devices and desktop computers that can display video in a 360-degree view.	-0.6593215928
BERLIN (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corporation has joined the group of leading sponsors of the Olympic Games in an agreement that runs until 2024, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday.The car maker becomes the first company of its kind to join 11 other global brands on the IOC’s top sponsorship program (TOP) in a deal reported to be just under $1 billion.Toyota, the world’s biggest car manufacturer by volume, is also the third Japanese company to join TOP, after Panasonic and Bridgestone as the Olympics prepare to go to Tokyo in 2024.Both have also signed up to 2024.“Toyota is the world leader in its field and this partnership signifies a strong commitment to the future of the IOC and the Olympic movement,�� IOC President Thomas Bach said in the Japanese capital.The contract will officially run from 2017 to 2024 but Toyota, the third sponsor to commit to 2024, has marketing rights in Japan with immediate effect.“Long-term partnerships are the backbone of our commercial programs and they enable the financial security of the entire Olympic movement,�� IOC marketing chief Tsunekazu Takeda, who is also Vice-President of the Tokyo 2020 Games, said.Although it does not reveal contract details of its sponsorship agreements, the deals with its top sponsors generate more than $100 million per quadrennium.“We will do everything possible to fulfill our new role in The Olympic Partner Programme and to justify the trust that the IOC has placed in us,�� said Toyota President Akio Toyoda.“The addition of the mobility category to The Olympic Partner Programme is important recognition for our entire industry.”Other major sponsors, including McDonald’s, Samsung, Coca-Cola and Atos, have signed up until 2020 or beyond.	0.0290866783
TOKYO, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell nearly 5% to a four-month low on Tuesday, as investors returning after a long weekend dumped riskier assets following a spike in coronavirus infections outside China that threatened global growth.The Nikkei share average tumbled as much as 4.5% to its lowest since late October and was last down 2.99% at 22,686.61. An immediate support for the index was seen at its 200-day moving average at 22,196.The index showed a delayed reaction to falls in global stocks on Monday, when Japanese markets were shut for the emperor’s birthday.The broader Topix declined 2.71% to 1,628.59, with 97% of the stocks on the main board in the red.“In addition to rising infections, day by day more companies are refraining from events and business trips. That will surely have an impact on upcoming economic indicators,�� said Seiji Arai, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, feeding worries it could turn into a pandemic.Railway operators, normally seen as defensive plays, were hit hard after the Japanese government advised citizens and firms against making unnecessary travels.Central Japan Railway, which runs bullet trains between Tokyo and Osaka, fell 4.7% to a two-year low and East Japan Railway dropped 1.5% to a three-and-a-half year low.Keisei Electric Railway dropped 5.2%.Beer makers were also under pressure, with Asahi Group Holdings, Kirin Holdings and Suntory Beverage falling between 3.7% and 5.9%.Cinema operator Toho fell 4.3% and advertising firm Dentsu plunged 6% to hit a six-and-a-half year low on rising questions over whether the Tokyo Olympics will be held as planned.The yen’s sharp rebound over the past couple of sessions hit exporters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A top Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T executive said on Wednesday the Japanese automaker has no plans to abandon Takata Corp 7312.T despite the supplier's struggles with air bag inflators that could rupture and spray metal shrapnel at vehicle occupants.U.S. safety regulators on Wednesday expanded the number of vehicles in the United States affected by recalls for this problem by 28 percent to 7.8 million vehicles.Toyota has the second largest number of vehicles affected by the U.S. recalls at 877,000, trailing only Honda Motor Co's 7267.T 5.1 million vehicles, according to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Steve St. Angelo, head of Toyota’s Latin American operations, appearing at an event in Tokyo, said Toyota was standing by Takata, when asked whether the Japanese automaker had ever dropped a supplier.“Toyota, when you become one of our suppliers, you really become part of our family,�� he told reporters. “Toyota is very big on helping a supplier, on struggle points.“Toyota’s not one to just dump a supplier,�� he added. “Have we ever eliminated a supplier? Yes. But it’s really, really tough. We will exhaust every opportunity to help that supplier first.”St. Angelo, the company’s former chief quality officer in North America, said Takata was “doing what they’re supposed to do: understand the root cause, and then learn from it ... and put countermeasures in place.”NHTSA is investigating whether Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force have the potential to spray metal shrapnel at occupants. They have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.The probe has focused on inflators recovered from cars being recalled for repairs in hot and humid places like Florida. Takata is cooperating with that investigation along with 10 automakers.More than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled because of defective Takata air bags since 2008.Takata's largest customer, Honda, has already moved some business to rival inflator maker Daicel Corp 4202.T, a person with knowledge of the matter has said. Honda Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura said in July the automaker was reviewing whether to keep buying from Takata. 	7.098139494
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are set to rise 11 percent in October, led by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T which benefited from increased demand for compact cars as gasoline prices remained high across the country.The annual sales rate is expected to be 14.9 million vehicles for the second straight month, according to a Reuters poll of economists. This would also mark the best October since 2007, the year auto sales slowed and the U.S. economy tipped into a recession.Automakers will report monthly U.S. sales figures on Thursday.“This stability at a higher level is taking the edge off the risk factors for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013, as the U.S. economy wrestles with the European crisis,�� said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive.Rising home prices, attractive vehicle financing options and Americans�� growing need to replace their aging cars also spurred more consumers to showrooms.Disruptions from Hurricane Sandy, which hit the U.S. East Coast on Monday night, likely cut out about 100,000 vehicle sales - but that demand will come back in November, Jefferies analyst Peter Nesvold said.Over the last five years, the U.S. auto sector has undergone a wrenching overhaul that led to plant closures, job losses and the government-financed bankruptcy restructurings of General Motors Co GM.N and Chrysler Group LLC FIA.MI in 2009. Ford Motor Co F.N also overhauled its U.S. operations but did not take a government bailout.Auto sales are an early indicator each month of U.S. consumer demand.An 11 percent jump in October sales would illustrate the continued recovery of the U.S. auto industry, which three years ago was in crisis mode as sales fell to the lowest point in nearly three decades.The October sales report will be the last before Election Day, marking the end of a contentious U.S. presidential race that has repeatedly thrust GM and Chrysler into the spotlight in televised debates, stump speeches and campaign advertisements.The merits of the U.S. government auto bailout have been hotly debated during the presidential race, with Republican candidate Mitt Romney criticizing President Barack Obama’s willingness to extend direct government aid to the two U.S. automakers.Last week, Romney told a crowd in the crucial swing state of Ohio that Chrysler is considering moving “all�� Jeep production to China. The automaker, which makes Jeeps in Michigan, Illinois and Ohio, denied the claim in an October 25 blog and in an email to employees this week saying it was looking to make Jeeps in China, but will keep up U.S. production.Chrysler is set to show a 13 percent sales gain in October, according to auto research company Edmunds.com. GM, the largest U.S. automaker, is expected to report a 4.7 percent rise, while Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, may see a 3.5 percent bump.But Detroit’s gains will lag those of Toyota and Honda. Kelley Blue Book said Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, was helped by higher fuel costs, particularly in California, where prices rose to their highest level since mid-2008.Toyota sales are expected to jump by 25 percent, while Honda is set to post an 18 percent increase. Last year, the two companies were still facing vehicle shortages after a massive earthquake in Japan in March 2011.“We expect fuel economy will remain buyers�� top concern, especially in California, and small and midsize cars will benefit while larger SUVs and cars could suffer,�� Nesvold said.The October sales report caps a busy week for the U.S. auto industry, which saw third-quarter profit reports from all three Detroit automakers.GM on Wednesday posted a surprisingly strong profit on higher sales and vehicle prices, mainly in the United States, and said it was targeting a return to break-even levels in its European operations by mid-decade. GM shares rose 9.5 percent to end at $25.50 on Wednesday.	9.750160154
* Plant to produce Toyota Corollas, new Mazda SUV crossover* To develop electric vehicle technologies* Trump says plan a “great investment in American manufacturing��* Toyota to take 5 pct stake in Mazda; Mazda 0.25 pct in Toyota (Adds details from press conference, Trump comment)By Naomi Tajitsu and Sam NusseyTOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it planned to take a 5 percent share of smaller Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp, as part of an alliance that will see the two build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant and work together on electric vehicles.The plant was a surprise for investors at a time of cooling U.S. sales, but marked good news for U.S. President Donald Trump who came to office on the back of promises to bring back manufacturing and jobs for U.S. workers. He commented on Twitter that it was a “great investment in American manufacturing��.The plant, whose location is not yet public, will be able to produce 300,000 vehicles a year, with production divided between the two automakers, and employ about 4,000 people. It will start operating in 2021.Analysts said the plan was more than a political ploy. The alliance is also an attempt to catch up with rivals in the race for electric car technology, as tighter global emissions rules loom, along with the entry of new players into the market.“There will be new rivals appearing - Apple, Google - these are IT companies, we also need to compete with them, too,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company’s founder, told a news conference in Tokyo.He was appointed last year to lead Toyota’s newly formed electric car division, flagging the group’s commitment to a technology it has been slow to embrace.“What’s different from the past is that there are no nautical charts for us to follow. It’s without precedent,�� he said of the push into alternatives to the internal combustion engine.Other traditional automakers such as Daimler and BMW are also weighing how best to work on new, disruptive technology, from electric vehicles to autonomous driving, that require hefty investment and have turned firms like Google and Tesla into rivals.Toyota has set a goal for all of its vehicles to be zero emission by 2050. But until recently, it has said it favoured EVs for short-distance commuting, given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time.It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), while rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles.As part of the agreement, as well as electric car technology, Toyota and Mazda will work together to develop in-car information technologies and automated driving functions.Toyota, Japan’s biggest auto company, has been forging alliances with smaller rivals for several years, effectively engineering a loose network at the heart of the Japanese auto sector. It already owns a 16.5 percent stake in sixth-ranked Subaru Corp with which it also has a development partnership.Toyota is also courting compact car maker Suzuki Motor Corp to cooperate on R&amp;D and parts supply, as Toyota seeks to tap its smaller rival’s expertise in emerging Asian markets.As part of Friday’s plan, Toyota, the world’s second-largest automaker by vehicle sales last year, will take a 5 percent share of Mazda, and Mazda will take a 0.25 percent share of Toyota.Mazda said it could even expand the alliance, as long as it could stay in control of its own management. “We will study the possibility of expanding the capital alliance, but the basic premise is that autonomy is assured,�� said Mazda Executive Vice President Akira Marumoto.A stake in Mazda may also prevent future incursions by tech companies, one analyst said.“For a technology company which lacks the expertise in making cars, Mazda could look like a very interesting acquisition. They’re very good, they’re not too expensive. Maybe Toyota realises this,�� CLSA managing director Chris Richter said.“By buying a 5 percent stake, Toyota takes Mazda off the table rather than having it sit out there like a free agent which could someday be used against them.”Mazda, for its part, stands to gain from a deal that gives the small automaker a production foothold in the United States. At the moment, it ships all vehicles sold in the country, its biggest market, from its plants in Japan and Mexico.With an R&amp;D budget of around 140 billion yen ($1.27 billion) this year, a fraction of Toyota’s 1 trillion yen, Mazda lacks the funds to develop electric cars on its own, a predicament shared by Subaru and Suzuki.“Mazda needs electrification technology. In the past, they’ve pooh-poohed EVs, they’ve felt they can make internal combustion engines more efficient, but the bottom line is that globally you need to have this technology,�� said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.The automakers plan to produce Toyota Corollas and a new Mazda SUV crossover at the new plant, and the companies said they could eventually build other cars including electric vehicles.Toyota initially had been planning to produce Corollas at its new $1 billion plant being built in Mexico, prompting Trump to threaten punitive tariffs.The company has since said it will instead produce its Tacoma truck model in Mexico.	-0.4468588452

(Adds sales data from Ford, GM, Toyota)TORONTO, May 1 (Reuters) - Automakers reported solid Canadian vehicle sales in April, with a 4 percent overall gain on a year ago, as demand for truck and luxury brands buoyed the industry.Light trucks sales again overpowered passenger car purchases, even as gasoline prices continued to rise. Hybrid vehicles, which typically use both a traditional internal combustion engine and an electric motor, also sold well.Chrysler Canada said on Thursday that its total vehicle sales climbed 6 percent in April, as a surge truck sales more than offset slumping car purchases, and it claimed the country’s spot for top seller in 2014.But rival Ford’s Canadian unit took the lead in monthly sales, breaking records for its Escape and Explorer models and several hybrid vehicles.Ford said it sold 27,342 vehicles in April, a 2 percent decline from a year ago, as it bucked the industry trend with declining truck sales.Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said total vehicle sales climbed to 27,212 vehicles. Truck sales rose 22 percent to 24,229 vehicles, while auto sales tumbled 49 percent to 2,983 vehicles.“This month’s results marked the best April sales on record at Chrysler Canada in the last quarter of a century,�� Chief Operating Officer Dave Buckingham said in a statement. “Leading the pack are our Jeep and Ram products.”General Motors dealers in Canada came in third, selling 25,435 vehicles in the month, with strong gains for its Chevrolet brand.The Chrysler gains, which represent a 53rd consecutive month of year-over-year growth, include monthly sales records for Chrysler’s Jeep and Ram branded vehicles, including Jeep Wrangler and Ram trucks, the company said.Dodge and Chrysler minivans, produced in Windsor, Ontario, had a double-digit April sales increase for a combined 5,988 vehicles.So far this year, Chrysler Canada has sold 88,081 vehicles on a strong showing for its trucks.Toyota Canada sold 20,663 vehicles, a 2.9 percent increase, to take fourth place on the back of strong truck sale growth.Among luxury brands, Infiniti sales jumped almost 40 percent, Land Rover gained more than 26 percent, and Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Porsche all grew around 15 percent.The U.S. auto industry rebounded sharply in April from a bitter and extended winter, with four of the top six automakers reporting year-over-year gains in sales on Thursday.Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co all topped analysts�� expectations with double-digit sales increases. General Motors Co also beat expectations, with a 7 percent uptick. Ford Motor Co missed estimates, with a decline of 1.0 percent.	3.656872555

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T reached a deal on Friday to resolve a lawsuit in the United States over unintended acceleration issues, one day after a jury found the Japanese carmaker liable and ordered it to pay $3 million for defects that caused a 2007 fatal crash.A jury in Oklahoma on Thursday ordered the company to pay $3 million in compensatory damages to Jean Bookout, a driver injured in the 2007 crash, and the family of Barbara Schwarz, who was killed. Jurors were scheduled to resume deliberating on Friday on whether to award punitive damages against Toyota.Before the jury could reach a decision, Toyota and lawyers for the plaintiffs announced they had reached a confidential settlement to resolve the case.The lawsuit is one of the first involving acceleration issues to go to trial since similar concerns prompted Toyota to begin in 2009 to recall millions of vehicles. The lawsuit alleged that software defects in the electronic throttle control system of Bookout’s 2005 Camry caused it to speed out of control and crash, killing Schwarz.“While we strongly disagree with the verdict, we are satisfied that the parties reached a mutually acceptable agreement to settle this case,�� Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said in a statement.A lawyer for the plaintiffs, J. Cole Portis, said they were pleased with the jury’s decision. “We are fully convinced that Toyota’s conduct from the time the electronic throttle control system was designed has been shameful,�� Portis said in a statement. “We appreciate that the jury had the courage to let Toyota and the public know that Toyota was reckless.”The case is the first loss for Toyota in a string of early trials over acceleration issues, which prompted hundreds of lawsuits across the country in the wake of the recalls. The 2005 Camry at issue in the Oklahoma trial was not included in the recalls.Two earlier trials in Brooklyn, New York, and California, absolved Toyota of liability for alleged acceleration-related defects.There have been roughly 200 proposed class actions and more than 500 individual cases filed against Toyota since February 2009 over the alleged acceleration issues, according to a regulatory filing from the company.Toyota has already agreed to pay a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims for economic losses, such as repair costs or lowered resale value, over acceleration issues. That settlement did not cover personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits.(The story was corrected to make it clear in paragraph 3 that settlement resolves entire case.)	-2.157825037
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automakers around the world are awaiting a decision from U.S. President Donald Trump on whether he will impose up to 25% tariffs on U.S. car and auto part imports after a 180-day review period elapsed this week.Trump was briefed ahead of the expiry of the self-imposed deadline, which he set in May, to decide whether to again extend a review or impose tariffs that automakers have warned could cost jobs and dramatically boost vehicle prices.“I’ll make a decision fairly soon. I was fully briefed and I’ll make a decision fairly soon,�� Trump said on Wednesday.Officials from major automakers told Reuters they believe Trump will not impose new levies on vehicles from the European Union, Japan or elsewhere amid a trade war with China.The Trump administration first launched its probe of foreign autos in May 2018 and six months ago Trump agreed with an administration study that some imported cars and trucks are “weakening our internal economy�� and threaten to harm national security, but stopped short of naming specific vehicles or parts.Trump could make an announcement on Friday, but nothing is final until he signs off, administration officials say.Trump has been especially critical of foreign-made vehicles and jawboned both U.S. and foreign automakers to build more cars in the United States. “Cars are the big one,�� he said last year.A delay on tariffs could push the issue back to the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign and experts say it could be harder for Trump to impose a hefty tariff on a major consumer product close to an election.Tariffs may not be necessary, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said earlier this month. EU officials also expect Trump to announce a six-month delay.On May 17, Trump had postponed a decision on tariffs by up to 180 days as he ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to pursue negotiations.The White House declined to comment Thursday.Ahead of the deadline, foreign automakers have been eager to highlight their U.S. investments to try to dissuade Trump from using tariffs that they argue could cost U.S. jobs.On Wednesday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican ally of Trump's, attended a groundbreaking at Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE Chattanooga assembly plant, marking the beginning of an $800 million expansion to build electric vehicles and add 1,000 jobs.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS has also announced it will start making its Santa Cruz pickup trucks at its Alabama factory in 2021, with an investment of $410 million, as it seeks a foothold in the segment led by U.S. rivals.Japanese automakers and suppliers have announced billions of dollars in investments, most notably a $1.6 billion joint venture plant in Alabama by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Mazda Motor Corp. 7261.T.Germany’s merchandise trade surplus with the United States - $69 billion in 2018 - remains a sore point with the Trump administration as does Japan’s $67.6 billion U.S. trade surplus last year - with two-thirds of that in the auto sector.	-0.7451253482
TOKYO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] on Thursday said it would launch a taxi-hailing app for taxis operating in Nagoya, as the U.S. firm tries to expand its foothold in a country where it has been blocked from offering its own ridesharing service.The U.S. firm said it was working with Fuji Taxi Group, which has been operating for more than 60 years in the Nagoya area, located near the heart of Japan’s automaking heartland.The move comes after Uber announced a similar taxi-hailing app last year as a pilot project in Awaji, an island with a population of around 150,000 located near Osaka.It has been unable to bring its full ride-hailing services to the country as local regulations outlaw non-professional drivers from transporting paying customers.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, headquartered near Nagoya, last month announced it would invest $500 million in Uber to jointly work on developing self-driving cars, a bid by both to catch up to rivals in the hotly competitive autonomous driving business.Their deal deepens an existing relationship and reflects Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s strategy of developing autonomous vehicles through partnerships.	1.272984441
TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp needs clarity on the terms of Britain’s access to European Union markets after Brexit to secure production at its Burnaston plant in central England, it said on Wednesday.The Japanese carmaker’s comments echo calls from businesses in both Britain and abroad for the UK government to make progress in talks on future relations with the EU following the country’s planned departure from the bloc in March 2019.“We cannot stay in this kind of fog when we don’t know what will be the output of the negotiations,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said at the Tokyo Motor Show.“The quicker we can get clarity about that, the better it will be (for) the way we can prepare for the future.”Toyota, which employs more than 3,000 people in Britain, builds the Auris hatchback and the family Avensis car at Burnaston.Sources told Reuters this month the company would build the next Auris model at the plant assuming Britain secured a transitional deal with the EU.Toyota said in March it would invest 240 million pounds ($317 million) in the plant, but retaining tariff-free access to the EU’s single market was crucial.Leroy reiterated on Wednesday this was “absolutely key��.“Today (Burnaston) exports 80-85 percent of production to the European continent,�� he said.“If we move to something like import tax or trade tax or any kind of additional penalty, it will create a big negative impact in terms of competitiveness (...) and if competitiveness is not secured, we have to think about what we will do for the future.”He said Brexit talks, currently deadlocked over the divorce bill, needed to move onto future trading relations.“If the negotiations are postponed and postponed again, it’s clear that it creates some things that are not good for us,�� he said.Britain said on Wednesday it wanted an outline agreement on a transitional deal by the first quarter of 2018.It is seeking a two-year implementation period after March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.There were signs of a potential breakthrough in Brexit talks last week when EU leaders said they would begin preparations to move into “phase two�� in December, a step that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.	1.719822366
* Construction firms up after good Kajima earnings* Investors buy this year’s relative underperformers* Toyota and other cyclicals come under pressure* Retailers also lose steamBy Hideyuki SanoTOKYO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average edged up on Wednesday as construction firms and real estate developers gained on earnings but Toyota Motor and other cyclical shares buckled under concerns about slower global growth.The Nikkei average rose 0.5 percent to 20,626.85 while the broader Topix gained 0.6 percent to 1,670.03.Investors snatched up constructors and real estate companies, which have stayed out of strong rally in domestic-demand-oriented shares so far.Real estate companies rose 3.1 percent, with Mitsui Fudosan climbing 3.8 percent and Mitsubishi Estate by 3.5 percent.Construction firms gained 2.1 percent after upbeat earnings from Kajima Corp boosted optimism about the sector.Kajima rose 6.0 percent while rival Shimizu Corp rose 4.7 percent.Terumo, a medical equipment manufacturer, saw its shares jump 13 percent on strong earnings and the announcement of a share-buyback plan.“Generally speaking, this earning season has been pretty good,�� said Masaki Uchida, executive director at JPMorgan Asset Management.Toyota fell 2.6 percent even after the automaker posted a record profit for the April-June period as investors are wary about its global outlook, with China among the biggest concern.Suppliers of Apple took another beating as shares of the iPhone maker posted a big fall on Tuesday, failing to stem its decline after disappointing iPhone sales rekindled concerns over whether the company can continue its fast growth.Murata Manufacturing fell 5.2 percent to three-month lows while Alps Electric dropped 6.3 percent.“The market looks a bit similar to January-March quarter, when oil prices kept falling and investors were rotating out of cyclicals to defensive shares,�� said JPMorgan Asset’s Uchida said.“This may change only if we see an evidence that the U.S. economy will be doing well to withstand a likely rate hike,�� he added.Some defensive and domestic demand-oriented shares, where investors had taken shelter from worries over overseas economies, also showed signs of fatigue after recent rallies.Data published on Tuesday also showed Japan’s nominal wages tumbled by the most in more than five years in June, casting some doubt on the consensus view that consumption will hold up well.Fast Retailing fell 4.2 percent after same-store sales at its Uniqlo clothing outlets in Japan fell 1.5 percent in July from a year earlier, a second straight month of declines.Department store operator Marui Group fell 9.2 percent as its relatively upbeat earnings failed to excite investors.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor plans to launch hydrogen fuel-cell car models with its China partners Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) and FAW Group [SASACJ.UL], as the Japanese automaker tries to boost its presence in the world’s biggest auto market.Toyota will also equip GAC and their joint venture’s car models with fuel cells, according to a filing by GAC to the Shanghai stock exchange on Thursday.The companies did not disclose financial details of the projects which deepen cooperation among the partners to develop new energy vehicle and connectivity technologies.Fuel-cell cars use a stack of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity to propel the vehicle, with water being the only byproduct.Toyota will also expand cooperation on hybrid vehicles and aim to launch more battery electric vehicles with “good quality and low prices�� separately with FAW and GAC.Sources told Reuters last year Toyota planned to sell electric vehicles with GAC’s logo in their joint venture’s dealerships, in a move to meet China’s strict green car quotas.The new development plan reflects gestures of goodwill to Beijing by Toyota, whose Chief Executive Akio Toyoda wants to “step on the accelerator in China��, while needing “to strike a fine balance between China and the United States��, according to minutes of internal meetings seen by Reuters.Toyota sold around 1.5 million cars in China in 2018, far below its global rival General Motors and Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE China sales. However, it is laying the foundation to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, Reuters reported last year. Toyota in April said it had started supplying fuel-cell parts to Chinese commercial vehicle makers Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd and Beijing SinoHytec Co Ltd. In July it said it would supply key hydrogen fuel-cell parts to Chinese automakers FAW and Higer Bus.Toyota will also share resources and talent to develop “intelligent connected�� vehicles with GAC and FAW.	1.511593778

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE is hoping a sleek makeover will keep its Golf in the best-selling compact car spot, helping the German automaker overtake Toyota and GM as the world leaders.But the mid-range vehicle faces an onslaught of competition from cheaper and premium models, just as car makers grapple with an economic slump in Europe and slowing growth in China.VW has reported record deliveries and higher profits while rivals have struggled. However the seventh-generation Golf, to be unveiled in Berlin on Tuesday, may not be enough to keep Europe’s biggest automaker on its winning streak, analysts say.“Success of the new Golf is absolutely critical to VW’s expansion targets but the new version will be battling in a tough environment,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne, Germany.Volkswagen is on course to bump General Motors GM.N into the world no.3 ranking this year. It aims to sell a world-leading 10 million vehicles by 2018, up from the 8.36 million recorded last year, and push past Toyota 7201.T.The new hatchback will boast a range of features aimed at luring buyers away from cheaper rivals made by Hyundai, Skoda and Seat, volume makers including Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA and GM's Opel division, as well as from Audi and BMW BMWG.DE at the top end.Pricing has not yet been announced for the new Golf, which will be sleeker and more than 100 kilograms lighter than its predecessor, thanks to increased use of ultra-strong steel, making it cheaper to run and cutting emissions.The 140-horsepower petrol version will produce an average 112 grams of CO2 per kilometer, complying with European Union targets. It will also be 2.24 inches longer and 0.52 inches wider than its predecessor, enlarging the interior to compete more effectively with SUVs and minivans.To attract luxury buyers, VW is touting a higher quality cockpit finish with more screens and driving assistance gadgets aimed at fending off a sporty replacement of Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz A-Class and the new BMW 1-Series introduced last year.This may still not be enough to keep the competition at bay.“The European (compact) market is fully saturated and the Golf keeps attracting competition, even from within the VW group,�� said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, citing the Audi, Skoda and Seat brands.“It’s no synonym for future growth.”Research firm IHS Automotive is confident the Golf, with over 29 million global sales since its 1974 launch as the iconic Beetle’s successor, will keep the top spot.Sales will rise 17.3 percent to 630,000 units by 2017, it predicts, followed by Toyota’s Prius with an 18.7 percent gain to 488,000 and Ford’s Focus with a 2.4 percent decline to 443,000.But there are signs the company is worried.With its affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS, Hyundai 005380.KS is the envy of global rivals such as VW, outgrowing the market during a severe downturn by offering stylish models at affordable prices backed by savvy - if sometimes risky - promotions and helped by a cheaper currency.VW views Hyundai as a serious contender. Checking out a Hyundai model at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, chief executive Martin Winterkorn was caught on camera examining the steering wheel adjustment, and saying: “Nothing rattles ... Why can they do it? BMW can’t. We can’t.”The YouTube video has had almost 1.8 million hits.A risk for VW is that it is building its updated bread-and-butter car on a new modular platform, that will allow it to enhance parts-sharing among its car brands.While the new technology aims to make production of 3.5 million small- and mid-sized cars 20 percent cheaper, and shorten assembly by 30 percent, the scaling up means any defects could expose VW to the kind of mass recalls that blighted Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T in 2009-2010.The updated Audi A3 compact, a competitor from within the VW family stable, will be built using the same cost-saving architecture.The Golf is so crucial to VW’s success that it is the only model the company builds on four continents.VW expanded production of the Golf to a new plant in Osnabrueck, Germany last year, even as the financial crisis exposed chronic overcapacity elsewhere in Europe, forcing rivals Fiat FIA.MI and Opel to close factories in Sicily and Belgium.“The Golf has a preeminent role at VW because of its high production volumes,�� VW brand development chief Ulrich Hackenberg said recently. “It’s the face of VW.�� ($1 = 0.7933 euros)	0.3175409628
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it will set up a research and development company with a focus on artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley, as competition to develop self-driving cars intensifies.The world’s top-selling automaker plans to invest $1 billion in R&amp;D over the next five years in a departure from its cautious stance on automated drive.“I used to say, quite until recently, that we will go ahead with automated drive only if they beat humans in a 24-hour car race,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told a news conference.Related StoriesSchools that sue: Why more universities file patent lawsuitsTop 100 Innovative Universities: MIT“But I changed my mind after I got involved with planning of the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games (in Tokyo),�� he said, explaining it opened his eyes to the need for cars for the disabled and elderly.Technology firms such as Alphabet, formerly known as Google, and Apple are muscling into the auto industry, hiring car experts to bring self-drive cars to reality, hopefully within five years.But Gill Pratt, a former MIT professor appointed CEO of Toyota Research Institute, said the race to build self-driving cars had only just begun, with many safety hurdles to clear.“It is possible, at the beginning of a car race, that you may not be in the best position... But if the race is very long, who knows who will win?”The new firm, which plans to hire about 200 staff, aims to accelerate research and development in artificial intelligence and big data, the carmaker said.Pratt said Toyota vehicles around the world, all combined, travelled one trillion km every year.“As these vehicles travel, they produce a tremendous amount of information. Information about the vehicle, information about the environment and the information about the driver,�� he said. “We can use that information for tremendous social good. It is the key to accelerate the evolution of our future technology.��	0.3570559117
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, in its second-largest recall announcement, said on Wednesday that it would call back 6.39 million vehicles globally after uncovering five different faults involving parts ranging from steering to seats.The world’s biggest automaker said it was not aware of any crashes or injuries caused by the glitches, which were found in 27 Toyota models including the RAV4 and Yaris subcompact.Toyota said faults were also found in the Pontiac Vibe and the Subaru Trezia, two models the automaker built for General Motors and Fuji Heavy Industries.The automaker did not say now much the recalls would cost, and it was not clear if the faults stemmed from Toyota’s suppliers or its manufacturing process.The move by Toyota to announce five different recalls on a single day from Tokyo comes as major automakers face increasing scrutiny in the United States on how quickly they take preventive safety action and how quickly they share information with regulators and the public.Toyota agreed last month to pay $1.2 billion to the U.S. government for withholding information related to unintended acceleration in its vehicles. That safety crisis had caused Toyota to recall more than 9 million vehicles.In a high-profile case that has the potential to change U.S. safety regulation, Toyota rival General Motors is under investigation for failing to act on a known ignition switch defect linked to a dozen deaths. The company has recalled 1.6 million vehicles over the issue.In the largest of the recalls announced on Wednesday, Toyota said some 3.5 million vehicles were being recalled to replace a spiral cable that could be damaged when the steering wheel is turned. That could cause the air bag to fail in the event of a crash, the automaker said.In total, about 2.34 million of the vehicles to be recalled were sold in North America. Another 810,000 were sold in Europe.In the second-largest of the Toyota recalls, some 2.32 million three-door models made between January 2005 and August 2010 are being recalled to check for a fault in the seat rails that could cause the seat to slide forward in a crash, risking injury for the driver or passengers.The other recalls are for faulty steering column brackets, windshield wiper motors and engine starters.The recall announcement, which came during late afternoon Tokyo trade, knocked an additional 2 percent off Toyota’s already sagging shares.They quickly pared the extra losses, however, and ended down 3 percent at 5,450 yen, reflecting an overall weak tone in the market where the benchmark Nikkei average fell 2.1 percent.Toyota’s 6.39 million vehicle recall is the largest announced on a single day for the company since October 2012, when it called back 7.43 million Yaris, Corolla and other models to fix faulty power window switches.In the first two months of 2014, major automakers had announced 18 separate recalls in the United States, now the second-largest auto market behind China, according to the latest data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The recent wave of large-scale recalls represents a source of revenue for auto dealers who are paid by manufacturers to service defective cars.	1.058201058

TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd on Monday downplayed news that Toyota Motor Corp would adopt rival software for its future vehicle consoles, saying it was more focused on the faster-growing market for autonomous driving technology.Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), a collaborative effort of some 100 technology companies and automakers, said last week that Toyota would start using its open-source software in Entune 3.0 consoles of its 2018 Camry sedans, before deploying it in most Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold in North America.BlackBerry Chief Operating Officer Marty Beard said in a blog posting that he expected AGL - as well as regular Linux and Android - to take a share of the automotive infotainment market, where BlackBerry’s QNX is a dominant supplier.“None of these challenger platforms is close to displacing BlackBerry QNX in safety-critical modules, areas that are growing faster than infotainment in the modern software-defined car,�� Beard said in the blog post.QNX is a leading supplier of software for consoles that deliver video, mapping, hands-free calling and internet services to vehicles, and is pitching for more business in the race toward autonomous driving.QNX was not Entune’s main platform, but it did supply some peripheral infotainment software, BlackBerry spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said.She also said she was not sure whether QNX would continue to be used in new versions of Entune 3.0.Toyota is the first major automaker to adopt AGL, a project started five years ago to develop standardized open-source software for the auto industry.Christopher Rommel, head of embedded technology research at VDC Research, said that a Linux-based industry standard could threaten QNX’s strong position in infotainment, but that the BlackBerry unit has a history in smaller scale, real-time auto applications where Linux would struggle to compete.“There’s boundaries to where OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) want to put Linux or can put Linux based both on its memory requirements as well and latency and deterministic constraints,�� he said.AGL’s more than 100 members include Toyota, Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co, Suzuki Motor Corp and Subaru. Other members include chipmakers and auto suppliers.QNX said in October that it was working with Ford to develop increasingly automated vehicles, and executives have said they are in advanced discussions with several other major global automakers about similar partnerships.	-0.3246753247
SYDNEY, March 31 (Reuters) - Japanese stock benchmark Nikkei dropped on Tuesday on growing fears that Tokyo could go into its first-ever lockdown as the global coronavirus crisis showed no signs of abating.The Nikkei average fell 0.9% to 18,917.01, well below 19,500, the average cost of the Bank of Japan’s massive stock purchase since 2013.The index was down 10.5% for the month, its biggest monthly decline since May 2010, and down 20.0% year-to-date, its worst quarter since late 2008.The Nikkei’s volatility index, a measure of investors�� volatility expectations based on option pricing and considered to be a fear gauge, slid 11.4% to 49.41, moving away from a nine-year peak of 60.86, hit on March 16.Market sentiment got some relief in the morning from Chinese factory activity data, which unexpectedly expanded in March after contracting sharply to a record low in February. But the momentum didn’t last long.Analysts said some speculators sold stock futures in the afternoon, assuming the Bank of Japan would refrain from buying stocks on Tuesday.However, many institutional investors were reluctant to take new positions on the last day of the fiscal year, and also as they were unsure if and when Japan would declare a national emergency and implement lockdown measures.The broader Topix declined 2.3% to 1,403.04, with all but two of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finishing in negative territory.Among bluechip stocks, Toyota Motor Co Ltd lost 4.4%, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc shed 5.4%, and NTT Docomo Inc fell 2.8%.As Tokyo was seen moving closer toward a potential citywide lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic, shares of remote work-related firms bucked the overall market weakness.Web/TV conferencing services provider V-cube Inc surged 10.0%, while groupware maker Cybozu Inc soared 9.2%.Fujifilm Holdings Corp advanced 2.2% after domestic media reported the company planned to increase production of its Avigan anti-flu drug, also known as favipiravir.Fujifilm’s stocks climbed 6.0% on Monday after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would push for approval of the drug as a potential coronavirus treatment.Elsewhere, JSR Corp jumped 8.0% as U.S. activist ValueAct Capital said it has acquired over 16.5 million shares, more than a 7% stake, of the Japanese chip and display materials maker.

* Nikkei climbs 0.9 pct* Yen hits 7-mth low vs dollar on expectations of LDP election win* Profit-taking in non-exporters started - analyst* Real estate sector down on profit-taking* Softbank gains after J.P. Morgan lifts price targetBy Ayai TomisawaTOKYO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Nikkei average climbed to a two-month high on Wednesday, with exporters gaining after the yen hit a seven-month low against the dollar on expectations that a new government will aggressively push the Bank of Japan to expand monetary stimulus.Among exporters, the transport equipment sector was a notable gainer as foreigners bought carmakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, which advanced 2.2 percent and 3.2 percent respectively.Shinzo Abe, leader of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has called for more extreme measures from the central bank, including setting a 3 percent inflation target to pull the export-reliant economy out of deflation.His comments ahead of a Dec. 16 national election have whipsawed the yen, which hit a seven-month low of 81.975 yen to the dollar on Wednesday. A softer Japanese currency inflates exporters�� overseas earnings when repatriated and increases their sales competitiveness.The Nikkei climbed 0.9 percent to end at a two-month high of 9,222.52, with a resistance level seen at a September high of 9,288. The broader Topix advanced 0.7 percent to 767.01.Analysts said that sector-rotation may be seen during the next few days amid rapid rises in the Nikkei as some investors want to reshuffle their portfolios while securing profits on certain sectors.“Some investors are alarmed by the market’s fast-paced rises, and profit-taking is already seen in non-exporter sectors,�� said Yoshiyuki Kondo, an analyst at Daiwa Securities, adding that a further correction of about 200 points is possible in the Nikkei as the index has added about 500 points in the past week.The property sector was heavily hit, with the Topix real estate index falling 1.6 percent to post the biggest drop on the board. Mitsui Fudosan dropped 2.3 percent to 1,737 yen and Mitsubishi Estate shed 1.4 percent to 1,602 yen.“The sector had been up on a recovery in building vacancy rates and hopes for monetary easing, but it has become a target of profit-taking because it is little-affected by daily dollar-yen moves,�� Kondo said.The real estate sector has added 5.7 percent over the past week, and gained 47 percent this year.Toyota was the second-most traded stock on the main board by turnover, with Softbank Corp the most traded. Honda and Canon Inc were the fourth and fifth-most traded, respectively.Index heavyweight Softbank rose 3.0 percent to 3,005 yen after J.P. Morgan raised its price target on the mobile operator by 8.6 percent to 3,800 yen.“The Japanese stock market is completely dependent on the Japanese yen...so it’s very simple. Maybe foreign investors will rush into the Japanese stock market,�� said Yasuo Sakuma, portfolio manager at Bayview Asset Management.“If you look at the trading volume last Friday and the last couple of days, not only short-covering but also the long-only, new money is entering the Japanese stock market.”Sakuma said he was tilting his portfolio towards exporters, such as auto parts makers, and camera and electronic device makers and cutting his exposure to domestically-focused companies such as retailers.The benchmark Nikkei is up 9.1 percent this year, boosted by the 5.7 percent rally from Nov. 14 to 19. Still, the Japanese index lags a 10.4 percent rise in the U.S. S&amp;P 500 and a 10.2 percent gain in the pan-European STOXX Europe 600.	6.50624927

* Honda expected to post 33.5 pct rise in Jan-March net profits* Honda faces costs as it expands capacity to meet sales target* Mazda likely to book net profit for the first time in five yearsTOKYO, April 26 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd and Mazda Motor Corp are both likely to post near-record profits this financial year as they take advantage of export-friendly currency moves, but will face a fresh challenge: high costs of expansion.The Japanese carmakers, due to report quarterly profit figures on Friday, are cranking up the pressure on South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and other foreign rivals.Analysts expect Honda, the third biggest-selling Japanese automaker, to post January-March profits up by over a third, helped by strong sales of its Accord sedan in the United States, its biggest market.Net profit for the year ended March is expected to have risen 87 percent to 395.6 billion yen ($4.0 billion), and now Honda wants to grow rapidly, focusing on emerging markets and small cars.Chief Executive Takanobu Ito has targeted annual worldwide car sales of 6 million and motorcycle sales of 25 million by end-March 2017, compared with last year’s figures of 3.8 million and 15.4 million respectively.To do so, Honda is expanding capacity. It is spending 44.6 billion yen to build a new car plant in Thailand that will fire up in 2015. This year it will add an extra line at a factory in Malaysia and start operations at Yorii in Japan, then open a new works in Mexico in 2014.These moves have required heavy capital spending and will also mean high start-up costs. Koichi Sugimoto, an auto analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, estimated Honda would face an expansion bill of 20-30 billion yen this year alone.“You could call them growing pains,�� said Christopher Richter, a senior analyst covering autos at brokerage CLSA Asia-Pacific. “Hopefully, these things will be selling a lot of cars for Honda justifying their existence.”Honda’s strategy stands in contrast to bigger rival Toyota Motor Corp, which insists it wants “sustainable�� growth. The world’s best-selling carmaker, which releases its fourth-quarter figures on May 8, does not plant to build any new plants over the next three years.Shares in all eight Japanese carmakers barring Suzuki Motor Corp have risen in 2013, helped by expectations that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies will spark growth.Honda is up roughly 20 percent and Toyota nearly 35 percent this year, while Mazda, whose shares are up almost 90 percent, is likely to turn a net profit for the first time in five years when it releases results on Friday.Analysts expect it to make net profit of 28.8 billion yen in the year ended March, up from a 107.7 billion yen loss in the previous year, and to post January-March operating profit of 31.9 billion yen.Mazda, for years hammered by a strong yen because it exports about 80 percent of the vehicles it makes in Japan, is now in a position as an export-led company to cash in on the currency shift.Mazda is also expanding overseas. It said in January it will invest $650 million in a new plant in Mexico due to start operating in 2014, when it will produce Mazda2 and Mazda3 cars for sale in North and Latin America, as well build cars on contract for Toyota.The yen has lost around 15 percent of its value versus the dollar since January, raising expectations of stronger performance at Mazda, but any turnaround will not be immediate, given that the company hedges currency trades six months ahead.“The current depreciation of the yen will really come into effect for Mazda in the second half of the year ... The company is certainly benefiting from the yen, but that may not be as much as the market expects,�� BNP Paribas�� Sugimoto said.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Two major U.S. automotive trade groups said Wednesday they will merge as the industry faces dramatic challenges, including regulatory, trade and emissions issues.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing Detroit's Big Three automakers, major German automakers and others including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, is merging with Global Automakers, a group representing primarily Japanese and Korean automakers including Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, as well as some automotive suppliers and Peugeot SA PEUP.PA. Reuters first reported in October the two groups had been in merger talks for months and were working to finalize a tie-up, citing senior automotive officials. The merger officially took effect last week.The newly combined entity will be named the Alliance for Automotive Innovation all will represent automakers who produce nearly 99% of all light-duty vehicles sold in the United States. The largest U.S. seller not a member is Tesla Inc TSLA.O.It will be run by Global Automakers chief executive John Bozzella.“The industry is changing dramatically. We’re going through a significant transformation in not only how we move from Point A to Point B but the technologies that go into that movement,�� Bozzella told Reuters, who is announcing the merger at the CES technology show. “This is the time to unify.”Global Automakers�� prior trade policy effort known as “Here for America�� will be spun off to handle trade issues that do not have wide agreement in the industry.Washington is grappling with how to address partial and eventual fully self-driving vehicles and revise fuel efficiency standards. The Trump administration has also not ruled out imposing new tariffs on major auto producing countries.The combined group agreed it would not advance legal actions siding with the Trump administration over California emissions.In October, General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI and Global Automakers moved to intervene on the side of the Trump administration in its efforts to bar California from setting tailpipe emissions standards, while others including Ford Motor Co F.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Honda opted not to join the litigation.That legal challenge will remain independent of the new trade group. The Trump administration in the coming months plans to finalize a significant reduction in Obama-era fuel efficiency standards. That will draw numerous legal challenges and potentially leave automakers uncertain about future requirements.The merged group had a round of voluntary buyouts in recent weeks.GM chief executive Mary Barra said in a statement that “as the industry is undergoing rapid transformation it is critical that we come together with a stronger voice.��	0.5480037008
June 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will cut its production capacity in Japan by more than 10 percent from current levels to about 3.1 million units by 2014, continuing to reduce its domestic output, the Nikkei said on Wednesday.The automaker will not lay off workers as part of the cuts and is keen to ensure that its domestic suppliers and partners remain profitable, the newspaper said.The company wants to maintain domestic production at about 3 million vehicles per year, down by about 500,000 units from current levels, even if a strong yen hurts export profitability, the business daily said.Toyota has already cut capacity by 100,000 units at its subsidiary’s factory in Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan and its overall domestic capacity is expected to fall to about 3.6 million units this year, the Japanese daily said.The company’s capacity was about 3.9 million vehicles in Japan before the global financial crisis hit, the Nikkei said.	-2.907728095

DETROIT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are spicing up their compact and subcompact lineups in the United States, with Toyota Motor Corp’s Furia concept car hinting at more aggressive styling for the 2014 Corolla and Honda Motor Co taking subcompact cars to the next level with its Fit-based SUV.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, gave a glimpse of what the new Corolla, likely to go on sale later this year, could look like when it unveiled the Furia concept sedan this week at the Detroit auto show.The orange Furia has an aggressive front face with sharply angled headlights and a low center of gravity, design features that already have been applied to some recent models like the Avalon and the Auris hatchback and could help attract younger buyers.“It’s only a concept, but the Furia sends a clear message where we are going in the future. Not only is the styling more expressive, but also reflect our overall approach to the compact segment in every way,�� Bill Fay, the group vice president and general manager of the Toyota Division at Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., said on Monday.The Corolla is Toyota’s top-selling model globally and the second most-popular Toyota vehicle in the United States after the Camry. Toyota sold 290,947 Corollas in the United States in 2012, up 21 percent from a year earlier.Honda unveiled a concept urban SUV that will share platforms with the Fit subcompact car.Honda has been vocal in its emphasis on small cars, aiming to secure a quarter of its global sales with the Fit series by the financial year ending March 2017. The Fit is also known as the Jazz.Japan’s third-biggest automaker, Honda aims to sell 6 million vehicles globally by March 2017, a jump from the current 4 million, and is set to start selling the remodeled Fit by late 2013 in Japan.“There is no doubt that increasing fuel efficiency and making cars smaller to cut materials and energy used to build them is a trend in the auto industry,�� Honda Chief Executive Takanobu Ito told reporters on Monday.“The path that cars should take in the future cannot be discussed without the development of small cars, and this is not just for Honda.”The Fit-based SUV, which will be manufactured in Honda’s new Celaya plant in Mexico as well as in Japan and Asia, is set to go on sale in Japan later this year and in the United States in 2014.Nissan Motor Co, Japan’s second-biggest automaker, presented the Versa Note compact at the Detroit show on Tuesday.The Versa Note, which is a hatchback companion to the Versa sedan, is set to go on sale in the United States in the summer with a starting price of $13,990.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T refuses to be tempted away from its low-risk growth strategy, even as the world's bestselling carmaker met its mid-term profit goals in the year ended March, and foresees even higher earnings this fiscal year.The company has exceeded the target President Akio Toyoda set two years ago: to make 1 trillion yen in annual operating profit, and do so with a 5 percent margin. Its manufacturing arm in Japan also made a profit for the first time in five years, a symbolic triumph for a titan of Japanese industry.This year, the company will concentrate on sharpening productivity in order to become more competitive, Toyoda said.Mindful of lessons learned from huge losses run up in 2008 after a period of boom and rapid expansion, it sees high profits as no reason to launch into a building program - even as some rivals do exactly that.“The wind that was blowing against us is calming down, and we can hear some saying that it is the time for us to take the offensive. But I think we are just standing at the startline of sustainable growth��, the 57-year-old grandson of the founder of Toyota’s automotive business told reporters on Wednesday.Toyota expects to make operating profit of 1.8 trillion yen ($18.17 billion) in the fiscal year that ends March 2014, which would be below its peak of 2.3 trillion yen in the year ended March 2008Powering that will be another year of record group sales in calendar year 2013, the company believes, reaching 9.91 million vehicles. It could become the first carmaker in history to sell more than 10 million vehicles in a year.Since Toyoda took helm in 2009, when profit margins were thin, the automaker has focused on cutting costs and improving profitability.Evidence of Toyoda's caution is his fresh policy to build no new factories for the next three years, a sharp contrast with Honda Motor Co 7267.T which is rapidly adding to its production power around the world.“Expansion of volume does not equate to growth. The driving force of sustainable growth comes down to making ever better cars,�� Toyoda said.Toyota posted on Wednesday an annual operating profit of 1.32 trillion yen with an operating margin of around 6 percent, beating a market that had expected 1.26 trillion yen profit, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine’s SmartEstimates.

The company is expected to release the Corolla compact car in the United States this year.“While the fierce competitive landscape (in the U.S.) will likely mean that Toyota may see growth taper off in the short term, new product launches later this year should help to give sales a boost,�� said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.In Japan, where automotive-related jobs account for 8.7 percent of the workforce, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, it is becoming more profitable to make and export goods as a result of a yen that has weakened by around 15 percent against the dollar since January.Toyoda repeated his vow to continue making 3 million vehicles a year in Japan. The company exports 60 percent of its Japan-made vehicles.Despite building no new plants Toyota, which currently has an annual production capacity of around 9 million vehicles, will still be able to make more cars.It will stick with pre-existing plans to build new factories such as in Thailand and Indonesia and will also add capacity at plants already running, for example at its Kentucky plant in the United States.After recovering from a damaging safety recall in 2010 and a huge earthquake in 2011 in Japan that disrupted supply chains, Toyota booked record group-wide sales of 9.7 million vehicles in 2012, beating General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.Shares in Toyota have risen 37 percent since the beginning of 2013, outperforming the Nikkei index that has rose about 34 percent in the same period.Toyota released its results after the close of trade on Wednesday.On Wednesday, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T, which makes Subaru cars, booked record annual operating profit of 120 billion yen for the year ended in March, more than double last year's figure.

SEOUL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor said on Friday its China sales climbed 37 percent to 80,598 vehicles in October from a year earlier, as the South Korean car maker continued to gain at the expense of Japanese rivals due to anti-Japan sentiment in the world’s top auto market.Hyundai has started its third plant in China, helping the automaker increase supply at a time when the likes of Toyota Motor suffered from sales falls.Violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September after Japan nationalized two East China Sea islands, known as Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese, by purchasing them from their private owners.

FRANKFURT, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects sales in Europe to fall slightly this year as higher deliveries in the western part of the region are unlikely to offset a sharp drop in Russia, the carmaker’s regional sales head said on Monday.The Japanese auto group, which counts 56 countries, including Israel and Turkey, as part of its European market, sold 888,000 vehicles in the region last year.“The Russian market at the beginning of the year wasn’t down so badly, we had some carry-over sales from the previous year ... the full impact will hit all car companies, not just Toyota, in the second half,�� Karl Schlicht told journalists ahead of the Frankfurt auto show, adding the company’s European shipments would likely be 1 to 2 percent shy of last year’s figures.He also said he expected to see some growth next year, mainly on the back of further recovery in western Europe and new models, but declined to give a figure.Toyota’s head of European operations said separately that the 2016 sales growth could be around 1 percent.	2.067355785
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Volvo has just given Tesla a shock. The Sweden-based carmaker on Wednesday said it will stop producing new gasoline-only engines from 2019 and shift to a variety of hybrid and all-electric models. That may not appear too significant at first �� the company, after all, accounted for just 0.6 percent of global vehicle sales last year. But its plan sums up the challenges faced by Elon Musk’s firm.Granted, Volvo is over-revving its engine by proclaiming it’s going “all electric.�� It has no plans yet to drop existing gasoline vehicles. And it will keep the combustion engine in two of the three options it will introduce starting in two years�� time �� a plug-in hybrid, which can use either gasoline or electric power, and what it calls the mild hybrid, like Toyota’s Prius, which converts braking power into electricity.REUTERS RECOMMENDSTesla's Model S fails to ace some tests in highway safety��evaluationU.S. cars a tough sell in South Korea even as Trump targets trade dealFord's China sales bounce back in June as tax impact fadesThe industry sells more cars with these engines than pure electric-powered ones. That’s especially true in the fast-growing Chinese market, where around half the world’s electric and hybrid cars are sold and where Volvo’s owner, Geely, is based.Tesla accounts for just 3 percent of electric vehicle and hybrid sales there, Barclays points out. Local players selling cheaper cars dominate; meanwhile, the likes of Daimler and General Motors are bulking up. That’s likely to bring down the cost of batteries even further, robbing Tesla of one of its major advantages.It’s emblematic of the growing competition Tesla is facing around the world. Virtually all carmakers have electric and hybrid offerings of their own, whether smaller vehicles like the Nissan Leaf or BMW’s high-end i3 and i8.That doesn’t mean Musk’s company is driving down a dead-end street. But it once again calls into question his aggressive target of selling 500,000 vehicles by the end of next year �� five times this year’s run rate and just shy of what Volvo currently delivers - and 1 million by 2020.Moreover, Tesla is still suffering from growing pains. The latest slip-up was a lack of batteries, which kept production 40 percent below demand for much of the second quarter, the company said just before the July 4 holiday.That and Volvo’s news took more than 7 percent off Tesla’s stock on Wednesday. Even so, Musk’s carmaker trades at 25 times estimated 2020 earnings, compared with Toyota’s multiple of just over 10 times 2017 earnings. More pain lies ahead.	5.218032636

SYDNEY, May 26 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Monday it will recall almost 46,000 cars in Australia and New Zealand after routine testing found an automatic seatbelt tightening mechanism may fail in an accident as a result of unexpected friction with a bolt.GM’s Australian subsidiary GM Holden Ltd said it would recall certain 2014 Commodore and Caprice models a week after South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co recalled 137,500 vehicles globally because of concerns their air bags might come loose.Earlier this month, Toyota Motor Corp recalled 466,000 vehicles globally, mostly in the United States, for possible faulty brakes and loss of a spare tire.GM Holden said an internal investigation found the pretensioner wiring harness - which pulls the seatbelt tight - may touch a bolt on the seatbelt buckle and experience wear, creating a risk of failure in the event of an accident.There were no reports of injuries related to the issue, which affected 41,933 vehicles in Australia and 3,744 in New Zealand.GM Holden would contact all potentially affected customers and arrange a repair.In December, GM Holden said it would cease all vehicle production in Australia as early as 2016.

NAGOYA (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp on Wednesday said they planned to produce electric vehicles (EVs) and compact cars for each other to better compete with fast-changing technologies in the global auto industry.The agreement follows an initial R&amp;D tie-up announced by Japan’s No. 1 and No. 4 automakers in 2017, and will see more vehicles produced by Suzuki for Toyota, one of the world’s biggest carmakers.Although Suzuki is far smaller, it is a dominant force in the fast-growing Indian market.The two automakers have been pooling their strengths.Toyota is a leader in hybrid technology and is investing heavily in automated driving, while Suzuki specializes in affordable compact cars -- as many automakers struggle to keep pace with ballooning investment in EVs and self-driving cars.Under the latest agreement, Suzuki will source gasoline hybrid systems for cars it sells worldwide from Toyota, which pioneered hybrid vehicles with the Prius more than 20 years ago, the companies said in a joint statement.In return, Suzuki will produce two compact models for Toyota in India based on its Ciaz and Ertiga models.Further cooperation with Suzuki will help Toyota expand its presence in India, the world’s fifth-largest passenger car market where it has struggled to grow sales due to lean demand for its lower-cost models.The deepening partnership between the two automakers will enable cost-conscious Suzuki to tap into Toyota’s R&amp;D firepower to develop lower-emission vehicles and self-driving cars - areas which Suzuki has admitted it is struggling to keep up.“We believe that the expansion of our business partnership with Suzuki ... will help give us the competitive edge we will need to survive this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in a statement.The two automakers will deepen their cooperation in India, where Suzuki’s hybrid vehicles will be made using engines and batteries locally produced by Toyota.They will also join forces in Europe, where Toyota will produce electric vehicles based on its RAV4 SUV crossover and Corolla wagon for Suzuki, while Suzuki will supply Toyota with gasoline engines for compact vehicle models sold in the region.Suzuki will also produce its Baleno, Vitara Brezza, Ciaz, and Ertiga models for Toyota which will be rebranded and renamed as Toyota models for the African market.	3.088674859
"DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. car and light truck sales slipped 1.8 percent in January as automakers pulled back on bulk sales to rental, government and business fleets and concentrated on more profitable retail sales to individual consumers.Fleet sales, particularly those to rental agencies, are skewed toward passenger cars, which are falling out of favor as consumers shift to sport utility vehicles and trucks.""It is the year for trucks and crossovers (SUVs). That's what it's all about,"" said Judy Wheeler, head of U.S. sales for the Nissan 7201.T brand. Nissan's Rogue SUV continued to be its top seller as sales soared 45.5 percent in January.Autodata Corp showed that 62.6 percent of January U.S. sales were of SUVs and trucks, up from 58.2 percent a year ago.January sales fell 1.8 percent to 1.14 million vehicles, or a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.61 million vehicles, down from 17.9 million vehicles a year earlier, according to Autodata. The annualized rate was roughly in line with the forecast of 17.55 million in a poll of 40 economists by Thomson Reuters.Industry executives are optimistic that sales could hit another record in 2017, with a boost from pro-growth economic and regulatory policies expected from President Donald Trump. Many forecasters had earlier predicted a decline in U.S. vehicle sales this year.Even with U.S. consumer confidence falling in January, households remained upbeat about the labor market, suggesting the economy would continue to grow this year.General Motors Co GM.N posted a 3.8 percent decline in January sales from a year ago, while crosstown rival Ford Motor Co F.N said overall sales slipped by 0.6 percent.Ford’s high-margin F-Series pickup truck sales jumped by 12.5 percent, but passenger cars sales dropped 17.5 percent.Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T both had sales gains of 6 percent in January, but Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T reported a surprising drop of 11 percent. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N said January sales slid 11 percent, reflecting a cut in deliveries to fleets. Sales of its Jeep brand of sport utilities fell 7 percent. Still, the latest results highlighted the accelerating shift in consumer demand toward SUVs. Three Japanese-brand compact utility vehicles, the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV 4, each handily outsold last year’s best-selling car, the Toyota Camry.Automakers have been scrambling to ramp up capacity to build more SUVs, even as they cut production at car plants.Some analysts cautioned against reading too much into January’s results. December’s surprisingly good showing pulled sales from January, normally the weakest month of the year in terms of sales volume, analysts said.December consumer confidence reached its strongest in 15 years."	-1.414476556

* Retail stocks outperform* Toyota, Bridgestone, Denso among big losers* Investors eye trade talks, U.S. FedTOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei edged up on Thursday after a weak yen supported overall sentiment, but a profit warning by Germany’s Continental dragged down auto stocks and tire makers.The Nikkei share average ended 0.2 percent higher at 22,410.82.Analysts said that investors were staying on the sidelines as China-U.S. trade talks were underway and the U.S. Federal Reserve held its annual symposium in Jackson Hole.U.S. and Chinese officials met for the first time in over two months to find a way out of their deepening trade conflict, but there was no evidence the low-level discussions would halt a new round of U.S. tariffs due Thursday.U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers will meet at Jackson Hole on Friday to discuss the root causes of stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and tepid productivity gains.“Investors want to find out which direction the market will be taking, whether there will be changes in the momentum after these events,�� said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management.Auto shares, tire makers and autoparts makers fell after automotive supplier Continental AG nosedived 13 percent on the back of a profit warning.Toyota Motor Corp fell 1.1 percent, while Nissan Motor Co dropped 2.0 percent, and Bridgestone Corp lost 2.0 percent,Yokohama Rubber was down 2.7 percent, Denso Corp lost 2.8 percent and Tokai Rika dropped 3.2 percent.Gainers included discount furniture store operator Nitori Holdings, up 3.9 percent after its August same-store-sales rose 0.7 percent.

(Repeats item first published on Monday with no changes to text)NAGOYA, Japan, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is one of the conspicuous success stories of Japan’s radical efforts to revive its economy, with profits rebounding and its 60,000 workers in Japan hoping this year to receive their first base wage rise in six years.But when the carmaker reports on Tuesday quarterly profits that are likely to be nearly five times what it booked a year ago, its continued revival will mask a much less optimistic mood among the auto industry’s smaller firms.For them, the reflationary economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, dubbed “Abenomics��, have failed to trickle down beyond the big carmakers, which are actually continuing to squeeze their networks of suppliers.Pay rises are the last thing on their minds.“Behind the recovery at the big carmakers is their pressure on suppliers to cut parts prices. It’s been hitting us like a body blow,�� said a senior executive of a company that makes drivetrain-related parts for a major Toyota supplier.At this small company based in Aichi prefecture, home to Toyota and much of its supply chain, orders have yet to recover from the global financial crisis, and profitability has actually fallen. Operating profit margin has fallen to below 2 percent from around 5 percent in 2008, largely due to pressure to cut parts pricing, said the executive.Like other suppliers interviewed for this story, the executive declined to be identified for fear of jeopardising the firm’s position in Toyota’s supply chain.Toyota did not comment on details about pricing and cost arrangements with its suppliers.Its president Akio Toyoda has acknowledged that “there are expectations on Toyota�� to pass on the benefits of Abenomics to its workers, but he has not clarified how that would be done.Toyota is under political pressure to raise wages as its union is set to demand a 1 percent base pay rise, which would be a modest hike by international standards but represent a watershed for Toyota workers who earn less every month on average now than they did a decade ago.However, a Toyota wage rise would not necessarily represent a triumph for Abenomics - a mix of fiscal spending, economic reform and monetary stimulus designed to pull Japan out of a decades-long slump - in the broader auto industry.Lower down the supply chain, many companies, especially the smaller ones, are unlikely to be able to raise base wages, partly because of the price and cost-cutting pressure. And given that the minnows of the industry account for the bulk of its jobs, that could be worse than a zero-sum game.“Polarisation between large automotive parts-makers and smaller ones is likely to intensify because the big ones have the resources to take their business overseas and the smaller ones don’t, and this could also become more evident in employee salaries,�� said Seiji Manabe, professor at Yokohama National University and an expert on automotive suppliers.HAVES &amp; HAVE-NOTS OF ABENOMICSTo be sure, the fruits of Abenomics are trickling down below the carmakers, to some of the biggest or most technologically advanced parts suppliers which are making innovations and riding high on the wave of surging profits in the auto sector.But the virtuous cycle of Abenomics - rising wages, prices and spending - is a stranger to the smaller companies.Japanese parts manufacturers employ 612,000 people, almost four times as many as carmakers and motorbike manufacturers combined. Workers involved in the auto industry in one way or another are estimated at 5.48 million, about 9 percent of Japan’s working population, according to Japan’s auto lobby.Rengo, Japan’s top labour federation, has called on its member unions for an minimum 1 percent base wage rise.The Toyota union, which is covered by Rengo, is set to ask for a rise of 1.1 percent, or 4,000 yen ($39.22) per month, in the average base salary for Toyota workers, in addition to bonuses totalling 2.4 million yen and an incremental pay rise.Toyota’s domestic rivals, including Nissan Motor Co , Honda Motor Co and Suzuki Motor Corp , are also under union pressure for a pay rise.For Toyota, a 1.1 percent wage hike for an estimated 240,000 Japan-based employees, including its group companies, would add around 11.5 billion yen to its fixed-cost base, though this would be a tiny fraction of the 880 billion yen in additional operating profit that the global business expects to make in the year to end-March.The company spent years relentlessly cutting costs, a trend unlikely to be reversed, and it also demands price-reduction on suppliers every six months, which generally run at 1-3 percent, industry sources said.Under a drive launched in 2012 to make its cars more competitive, Toyota is boosting use of standardised parts. Toyota says its intention is to introduce better functions across a wider range of models, and cost cuts are just one of the many means of improving its vehicles.According to individuals familiar with the situation, this means Toyota is giving larger chunks of business to a smaller number of suppliers, and it is asking for cost cuts of 30 to 40 percent for some parts - in certain cases double that level.A senior executive at a parts supplier for Toyota said the Aichi-based firm had managed to cut costs by 40 percent for some parts by redesigning products and switching to cheaper imported materials, and so far that made it more competitive.“The question is whether we accept an even bigger cut. If we do so, then that soon becomes the norm, even if we are bleeding in dire red,�� the executive said.

* Kion could be valued at 2.5 bln euros in IPO - sources* Up to 25 pct of Kion to be floated - sources* Goldman, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley mandated - sourcesFRANKFURT, May 2 (Reuters) - Kion Group, the world’s second biggest maker of fork lift trucks behind Toyota Industries Corp, may go ahead with what could be one of Germany’s largest initial public share offers this year.According to people familiar with the situation up to 25 percent of Kion is likely to be listed in a sale that may value the whole company at around 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion).“I can confirm that Kion Group is considering a potential IPO in 2013,�� a company spokesman said, the company’s first official confirmation of the flotation plans.The Wiesbaden-based group is set to follow real estate group LEG, chemicals group Evonik and broadcaster RTL, which have all successfully listed in Frankfurt this year, taking advantage of the rally in stockmarkets over the past 11 months.“An IPO will take place in late June, early July if market conditions allow,�� one of the people familiar with the matter said, while another said the offer might equally not be launched until September or October.Kion’s owners, the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs and buyout firm KKR are planning to sell some of their shares, while the company also plans to sell new shares, one of the people said.China-based Shandong Heavy in August last year bought a 25 percent stake in Kion for 467 million euros ($616 million) and later secured the option to increase its stake to one third as part of an IPO.Since August 2012 shares in rivals like Toyota Industries, U.S.-based Terex and Germany’s Jungheinrich have gained between 20 and 33 percent.“It is conceivable that this will be taken into account in the valuation of Kion,�� one of the people familiar with the transaction said.Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are organising the flotation, sources familiar with the deal said.Kion was split off from gases group Linde in 2006 and operates a multi-brand business which includes Linde, STILL, Fenwick, Baoli and Voltas.In 2012 its earnings before interest and tax rose 20 percent to 438 million euros on sales up 8 percent at 4.7 billion euros.	1.122520014
ORLANDO/WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of U.S. Toyota drivers have received a stern warning by first-class mail: Immediately drive to your dealer to replace a flawed air bag, and in the meantime don’t let anyone sit on the passenger side.Thousands of Chrysler drivers with similar air bags are unlikely to get a formal notification until December. Meanwhile, they can expect free tickets to Disney World in exchange for allowing their air bags to be tested.Over the past six years, at least five deaths have been linked to air bags supplied by Japanese safety equipment maker Takata that could rupture upon deployment, spraying metal shards inside the car. More than 17 million cars have been recalled worldwide, including over 11 million in the United States.The number, however, represents a patchwork of “safety improvement campaigns,�� informal “regional recalls,�� and formal recalls of certain models rather a consistent national action.Some car owners are promised immediate repairs, others are told they will have to wait, while others have not been contacted at all.Behind the confusion is carmakers�� reluctance to commit to costly repairs while they still puzzle over what makes some bags explode and the U.S. safety regulators�� inability to nudge them towards full-scale recalls.Robert Lamoureux, 47, a coordinator for an events production firm in Orlando, heard about exploding airbags on the news weeks ago and confirmed on Honda’s website that his 2002 Accord SE was among the models that should be brought to a dealer.But the site told owners to wait for a notice in the mail, which only arrived at the end of October.“They said it was an air bag issue but they didn’t describe the issue. They didn’t come out and say, yeah, you might lose your face.”All five deaths, four in the United States and one in Malaysia, have been in Honda cars.Safety advocates and lawmakers say the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and carmakers, including Honda, Toyota, Chrysler, Nissan, BMW, and Ford, were too slow and inconsistent in their response.“There is an unequivocal need for national recalls,�� Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told Reuters.Regulators acknowledge they typically rely on the industry to take the initiative in recalling vehicles, but say the threat they will investigate is usually enough to prompt a recall.“We aggressively investigate and pursue recalls to protect the American public, forcing the recall of approximately 100 million defective vehicles and equipment over the past 10 years,�� said NHTSA deputy administrator David Friedman.Critics, however, say the agency should have pressured carmakers more and sooner instead of striking a June agreement with five manufacturers that let them voluntarily collect and analyze the potentially defective parts.Furthermore, such investigations were initially limited to hot and humid regions, considered most problematic. Only last month that area of the continental U.S. states was expanded to beyond Florida to include Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana and parts of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico.The safety agency and its allies argue that limited staffing and funding restrict how much it can investigate on its own, making it hard to formally force recalls.According to law, the agency can only force an automaker issue a binding recall through a process that gives the company multiple opportunities to present counter-evidence and can take years.Some experts see merits in pushing carmakers for voluntary, targeted recalls.“By starting the recall just in the highest risk areas, all the replacement parts can be directed there first,�� said Professor John Paul MacDuffie, director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation at Wharton’s Mack Institute of Innovation Management.Yet many safety advocates argue the agency should act with greater urgency to push for a national recall to ensure consistency of carmakers�� responses.While most automakers have by now sent out letters that say “Important Safety Recall,�� what happens next still varies widely.Toyota owners, for example, are told that should the new air bag not be immediately available, dealers will disable the faulty one and leave a tag on the glove compartment telling passengers not to sit in the front until a new air bag is installed.General Motors is prepared to offer loaner cars in case of a parts shortage, said company spokesman Alan Adler.BMW notified owners about the recall in August, but told them at the time it did not have the necessary parts. A second notice in October went to owners of affected cars nationwide - not just in the states targeted by the safety regulator - telling them that new air bags were available and should be installed immediately.Honda only early this month turned its “safety improvement campaign�� into a formal recall, but did not say how many cars were affected.The mixed messages make owners wonder how worried they should be.For some, like Caitlin Knowles, a 23-year-old waitress in Winter Park, Florida, it is already the second air bag recall.Knowles brought her 2001 Honda Civic in for repairs when she was told about the air bag problems in a 2012 notice.Now she wonders if Honda will get it right this time. “It’s definitely frightening thinking about a piece of metal going through your head.�� (Reporting by Barbara Liston in Orlando, and Julia Edwards and Patrick Rucker in Washington; Editing by Karey Van Hall and Tomasz Janowski)	3.904207775
TOKYO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks snapped a three-day winning streak on Friday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at a record low, raising worries about the health of both the U.S. and global economies.Investors also refrained from taking large positions ahead of long holidays next week in Japan.The Nikkei share average dropped 2 percent to 18,070.21 pointed, ending the week down 1.1 percent.Major Japanese exporters suffered after the dollar plummeted more than 1 percent overnight in response to the Fed’s assessment of the U.S. economy.Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co each dropped 1.4 percent while Panasonic Corp lost 2.1 percent.Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co, which invests most of the premiums it gets from policyholders in bonds such as U.S. Treasuries, dived 6.2 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has agreed to increase base monthly salaries by more than 1,300 yen ($12.20) for the year beginning April, according to the automaker's union.The increase by Japan’s largest automaker, considered a bellwether in the nation’s annual wage negotiations, would mark the fifth consecutive year of salary rises, but is less than 3,000 yen demanded by its union and is well below the 4,000 yen given in 2015.	-1.130769231
BEIJING (Reuters) - Sales surged for global automakers in China in 2016 as consumers rushed to buy cars to make the most of a tax incentive, with Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T seeing a particularly brisk pace of business ahead of Ford F.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.Toyota has traditionally led Honda in China - the world’s largest auto market - but last year Honda sped past with a year-on-year sales growth of 24 percent to 1.25 million vehicles, helped by a steady stream of fresh models particularly in the hot sport-utility vehicle segment.Toyota reported an 8.2 percent rise in 2016 sales. The automaker expects to sell at least 1.2 million vehicles this year, roughly flat with 2016.Ford reported a growth in China sales of 11.9 percent to 1.24 million vehicles in 2016, not including sales of its premium Lincoln brand, according to a Reuters calculation.All three companies, however, continued to lag sales by Nissan 7201.T in China. Nissan's sales grew 8.4 percent to 1.35 million vehicles in the country last year. Earlier this week, General Motors Co GM.N and its joint venture partners reported sales of 3.87 million vehicles in China for 2016, up 7.1 percent, cementing the country's position as the U.S. automaker's top market for a fifth consecutive year. Demand for cars in the Asian country got a shot in the arm last year from China’s move to cut taxes on small-engine cars.The tax incentive, which halved the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or smaller to 5 percent, is now being rolled back. The tax will rise to 7.5 percent this year before returning to 10 percent in 2018 - a move analysts say will prevent a steep drop in sales growth.	-5.677183052

* Flat y-o-y performance weakest month since December 2009* Group sales +0.2 pct at 864,500 vehicles last month* China group sales +11 pct to 262,500 cars in March* March shows markets becoming even more difficult-VW (Adds background, detail)By Christiaan HetznerFRANKFURT, April 12 (Reuters) - Monthly sales by Volkswagen grew at their weakest rate in over three years, evidence of a spreading slowdown in car markets beyond sickly Europe.The sales chief of the world’s third-largest automaker said almost all regions outside North America and China were hit by uncertainty that was “in some cases considerable��, particularly in Europe.“The data for March clearly show that the markets are becoming even more difficult,�� Christian Klingler said in a statement.Europe’s auto market last year plumbed lows not seen in nearly two decades after governments, banks, corporations and households from Madrid to Rome all tried to shed heavy debts at the same time, accelerating an economic recession and reducing demand for big ticket items like cars.VW’s deliveries to customers in March almost stalled, edging higher by just 0.2 percent to 864,500 vehicles as 11 percent growth in China helped offset weakness in Europe.VW last posted a weaker monthly performance in December 2009, when group sales declined 9 percent year on year, according to a spokesman.Over the first quarter, volumes rose 5.1 percent to 2.27 million vehicles, driven by a 21 percent gain in China, the group’s single largest market.Larger rivals Toyota and General Motors have yet to publish quarterly sales figures but Hanover-based analyst Frank Schwope of NordLB believes VW will overtake GM this year in size.“Volkswagen won’t likely be able to maintain its current 5 percent growth rate for the year. I think we will be looking at something closer to 3 percent with some 9.6-9.7 million vehicles sold, but that should still be enough to surpass GM,�� Schwope said.VW’s own brand sold nearly 600,000 vehicles to Chinese customers in the first three months, up 24 percent, while VW marques Audi and Skoda added 100,000 and almost 58,000 cars respectively.“In the midterm we are planning to increase the number of dealers to more than 3,000 to get closer to our customers,�� said Jochem Heizmann, Chief Executive of Volkswagen Group China, in a separate statement.Last year 2,054 dealers sold Volkswagen vehicles in China.Volkswagen’s ailing Seat brand, which completed its first year in China last month, delivered just 539 cars during the first quarter.Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker last year, is due to publish first-quarter sales volume data on April 24, while GM expects to publish theirs sometime next week.

(Reuters) - Alabama will be the site of a new $1.6 billion Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp auto plant, a victory for President Donald Trump who had prodded manufacturers to build new U.S. facilities and threatened tariffs on foreign production, sources said on Tuesday.The plant, which will employ up to 4,000 people and produce about 300,000 vehicles a year, will be located in Huntsville, Alabama, and is a boon for the state, where Toyota has a large engine plant and an existing network of automotive suppliers.A formal announcement by company and state officials is expected on Wednesday in Montgomery, sources briefed on the matter said.The new plant --in a state Trump won by 28 points in 2016 -- could be a political boost to the Republican president, who has urged automakers to build plants in the United States and add jobs. The companies said they expect the plant to open in 2021.Trump tweeted in March he wanted “new plants to be built here for cars sold here.�� The White House did not immediately comment on Tuesday.The announcement also comes at a time of declining U.S. auto industry sales, so it could exacerbate overcapacity and add pressure to cut prices. U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017, after hitting an all-time record high in 2016, and are expected to fall further in 2018.Details of an anticipated tax and incentive package for the investment were not yet known. It has been reported the companies sought at least $1 billion in incentives.A Toyota spokesman declined to comment, except to say an announcement was expected soon. A Mazda spokeswoman also declined to comment.In recent months, the companies had narrowed their choices down to sites in Alabama and North Carolina.Local media last month said the leading site under consideration was in northern Alabama’s Limestone County, near Toyota’s large engine plant in Huntsville. In September Toyota announced a $106 million technology upgrade for the Huntsville plant.A Chamber of Commerce of Huntsville website for the “Huntsville Mega Site�� touts the fact it has been “certified as development-ready.�� The commerce chamber, local and state officials declined to comment on Tuesday on plans for the plant.A year ago, President-elect Trump criticized Toyota and threatened hefty tariffs against the Japanese automaker if it built its Corolla sedan for the U.S. market in Mexico.“Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,�� Trump posted on Twitter in early 2017.Toyota and Mazda announced plans for a new plant in August. Toyota said it would shift production of Corollas from Canada to the new venture rather than in Guanajuato, and would build Tacoma pickups in Mexico instead. Mazda plans to build new crossover SUVs at the plant.Trump praised the joint venture announcement, saying in August on Twitter: “Toyota &amp; Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!”In October, Toyota said it would scale back investment in a planned plant in Mexico by 30 percent to $700 million and cut planned annual capacity in half to 100,000 vehicles as it shuffles its production plans to meet market demands.Toyota has 10 U.S. plants in eight states in an arc running from West Virginia through Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas.Toyota and Mazda announced a capital alliance in August and are exploring joint development of technologies for the basic structure of competitive electric vehicles.Over the last 30 years Toyota, along with German and Asian automakers, has built a second auto industry in the United States, rivaling the operations of the Detroit Three automakers in size and employment, but with newer, and fewer unionized, plants.States covet auto assembly plants because they typically pay above-average wages and spin off jobs at suppliers and service companies. Southern U.S. states have the advantage of good transportation infrastructure, business-friendly regulators and generally anti-union politicians.The Alabama Department of Commerce shows 150 of the large automotive suppliers operate in the state, providing the logistical strength that Kristin Dziczek, a researcher at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, said helped land the plant.Dziczek said that Alabama in 2017 was tied for fifth among U.S. states in auto production, at 9 percent with Tennessee. It was behind Michigan at 19 percent; Indiana at 12 percent, Kentucky at 11 percent; and Ohio at 10 percent.“The impact of an auto assembly plant extends beyond its immediate economic impact, and that’s why states offer robust incentives,�� said Dennis Cuneo, a site-selection consultant and former Toyota executive. “It creates a halo effect that in turn helps attract other projects.”Alabama spent an estimated $250 million to woo Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz to put an auto plant in Tuscaloosa two decades ago.	0.1246334311

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T unit Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc said it would recall about 423,500 RAV4 SUVs in the United States for an issue related to windshield wipers.The company said the recall includes about 421,000 units of 2009-2012 RAV4 crossover SUV and about 2,500 units of RAV4 EV, the all-electric version, from 2012-2014.Toyota said water dripping onto the windshield wiper links in these vehicles can cause corrosion and wear at its joint and separate the wiper link from the motor crank arm.This could reduce driver visibility, increasing the risk of a crash.Owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail, the company said.	3.980811311
* BMW and China dealers reach settlement over subsidies* Dealers say $820 mln deal struck, BMW declines confirm details* Toyota also negotiating with dealers in China (Adds details about BMW’s ageing product range, analyst comment)SHANGHAI/FRANKFURT, Jan 5 (Reuters) - BMW will pay 5.1 billion yuan ($820 million) to auto dealers in China who pressured the world’s top luxury carmaker to share the cost of overstocked showrooms, BMW’s main Chinese dealership group said on Monday.Car sales growth in China, the world’s largest auto market, was expected to halve to 7 percent in 2014, bringing demands for compensation from dealer groups which had bought vehicles on expectations of rapid growth.BMW has been hit by a slowing Chinese economy where cut-throat competition leave its ageing product range increasingly exposed. Its 7-series limousine for instance, on the market in China since 2009, competes with a new version of the Mercedes S-Class, launched in late 2013.BMW declined to give details of the deal but Chinese dealers and analysts were upbeat an agreement had been struck.“This is the biggest such subsidy we’ve had in China ... because last year, dealers had the highest level of stockpile,�� said Song Tao, deputy secretary general of the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), which had represented dealers in the negotiations.“I’m glad the negotiations ended with champagne,�� Song said in a phone interview.Other foreign automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp are also negotiating with their dealers in China, who have complained to the government that they are obliged to buy too much stock, leading to large losses in a slowing market.IHS Automotive expects premium car sales growth in China to slow to 5 percent by 2018 from an average rate of 30 percent over the past decade, while the market gets more competitive.Ford launched its Lincoln brand in China last year while luxury brands such as General Motors�� Cadillac and Nissan Motor’s Infiniti joined the rush to localize production.BMW started subsidising its dealers in 2012 due to falling retail prices, with the payout in 2013 reaching around 3 billion yuan, according to a senior executive at one dealership who declined to be identified.BMW shares closed down 3.3 percent at 85.08 euros.Analysts at Evercore ISI said a substantial amount of the payment had already been incurred in nine-month results released in November.“We believe it is positive that BMW has reached an agreement and this should put an end to the ongoing public statements by BMW’s Chinese dealers,�� Evercore said in a note.“The number mentioned by the Chinese dealer association covers all of BMW’s bonus and support payments to its Chinese dealers for 2014 and some payments for 2015.“This is not a new or additional number and it will not trigger any special reporting at BMW,�� the note said.For BMW, China remains the key battleground for retaining its crown of largest luxury auto maker by sales.BMW reiterated it is sticking to its full-year target of selling more than 2 million cars worldwide, saying it still sees China as a growth market which is “normalising�� after a spurt in the past few years.“Many automotive dealers in China had experienced pressures and challenges from the market in the second half of 2014,�� it said in a statement emailed to Reuters.Recent figures showed the company keeping its lead over rivals Audi and Mercedes, as sales in China and the United States helped it report record November deliveries.

(Reuters) - A Florida woman faces drunk-driving and other charges after plowing through the infield at the Daytona International Speedway and injuring four people, police said.Abbie Kinney, 43, of Cocoa Beach, Florida, remained in jail on Sunday after she crashed her Toyota pickup into four people and six motor homes and vehicles in track’s infield, where race fans were camping, early Saturday, according to a report by the Daytona Beach Police Department.She told officers she had drunk three beers and “shouldn’t have been driving,�� the report said.Kinney was found at the wheel of her vehicle after the crash, which happened shortly after 2 a.m. ET, the report said.

* Imports accounted for 12 pct of car market in Jan-April* Mkt gains accelerating since EU and U.S. free trade deals* Lawmakers want tighter measures on premium company cars* BMW unit in tax probe, others raided over pricing - mediaBy Hyunjoo JinSEOUL, June 14 (Reuters) - Recent free trade deals have helped foreign premium-brand automakers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz drive up sales in South Korea, previously a heavily protected market dominated by Hyundai Motor and affiliate Kia Motors.In January-April, sales of imported passenger cars accounted for 12 percent of the market, a fifth more than last year and up from just 2 percent a decade ago. Hyundai/Kia sales were flat.Now, the Koreans look like they’re trying to push back the foreign tide. Foreign automakers and distributors say various moves by Korean lawmakers and government agencies aim to make life tougher for them. Privately, some talk of “import bashing��.“Korea is a highly protected market. Despite recent agreements to open up its market, the government is not helping ... it’s actually doing its best to keep the barriers in place,�� said a senior global automaker executive, who didn’t want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.In March, South Korean lawmakers proposed a bill to reduce corporate tax breaks on cars priced above 50 million won ($44,000) and bought as company cars - typically those top-of-the-range models from German, Japanese and U.S. automakers. More than half the cars imported cost more than that, and at least 40 percent are bought under corporate accounts, industry data shows. For luxury marques such as Bentley, Porsche and Rolls-Royce, over 70 percent are bought as company cars.“It will deal a direct blow to sales of premium imported cars. It will depress consumer sentiment,�� said an executive at the local unit of an imported luxury marque. “We’re discussing measures to cope with the potential change, but we doubt whether there are real solutions.”Min Hong-chul, a lawmaker with the main opposition Democratic Party and one of those backing a revised tax policy, said the move was not intended to “regulate foreign cars, though it may end up doing so.”In February, Korea’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) raided the offices of the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association and of Volkswagen’s Audi, BMW, Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor’s Lexus as part of a probe into possible price collusion, according to local media.And this week, local media reported that BMW Korea was being investigated by the tax authorities. A spokesman for the BMW unit confirmed an investigation, but declined to say more.An official at the foreign car association refuted price-fixing charges, saying this was impossible given there are 400 or so foreign models involved. Toyota, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen confirmed their sales offices in Seoul were raided, but declined to elaborate. FTC officials declined to comment.“HIDDEN OBSTACLES”Hyundai and Kia have over 70 percent market share in South Korea, but that is being eroded by imports following free trade agreements struck with the European Union in mid-2011 and with the United States eight months later.Hendrik von Kuenheim, head of BMW Group’s Asia, Pacific and South Africa regions, welcomes the free trade deals, which will phase out tariffs on cars from Europe with engines bigger than 1500 cc - from 8 percent two years ago to zero next year. In the late-1980s, Seoul protected its autos industry with a 50 percent import duty.But von Kuenheim said there are still “hidden obstacles�� when selling cars in South Korea, where nearly 1.6 million vehicles were bought last year.“Local authorities, be they in Germany, in Europe or in Korea, still need to work hard and overcome the latest and the smallest annoying obstacles,�� he told Reuters on the sidelines of a groundbreaking event for BMW’s $62 million driving education centre outside Seoul. “Let the intention of a free trade agreement prevail,�� he said, without elaborating on what these obstacles are.BMW’s South Korean sales rose 14 percent to 14,155 cars in January-May, while Volkswagen increased its sales by 42 percent to 9,208 and Ford Motor sales jumped 50 percent to 2,712. Toyota and other Japanese automakers took advantage of the lower tariffs on U.S.-made cars, importing models like the Camry midsize sedan from factories in the United States.A spokeswoman for Hyundai Motor declined to comment specifically on the issue, but a Hyundai dealer said he was concerned about the rising number of imported cars. “It’s increasingly difficult to sell cars as consumers are turning their eyes to foreign makes,�� said the dealer, who works in the affluent southern Seoul suburb of Pangyo.To be sure, free trade deals work both ways - and South Korean automakers have grabbed market share in Europe from PSA Peugeot Citroen and others - prompting measures by France that could have led to duties being imposed. Eventually, the European Commission rejected France’s request.Longer term, imported cars are expected to continue making inroads into South Korea, say industry experts, with global automakers offering a wider range of products. Imported cars have long had cachet in South Korea, and the free trade deals have made them more affordable, too.Even if the tax bill is passed - the lawmakers hope it will win parliamentary approval as it’s in line with the government’s policy to increase tax revenue - “it will not stop the sales growth of imported cars,�� said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of engineering at Daelim University College in Seoul.That’s a warning to not only local heavyweights Hyundai and Kia, but also the Korean units of General Motors and Renault, and Ssangyong Motor, whose biggest shareholder is India’s Mahindra and Mahindra.Dealers say Korean automakers are not only losing ground to premium cars from Europe, but also to more fuel-efficient hybrid models from Toyota. While German cars account for almost 7 of every 10 imported cars sold in South Korea, Toyota more than doubled its sales in January-May.But Koreans�� love for German cars has grown strong.Kim Ki-hyon, a 28-year-old pharmacist, drives a BMW 535i rather than a local branded car. “It’s like drinking Starbucks rather than instant coffee. They both have caffeine to wake you up, but one tastes better,�� he said.	10.44470949
TOKYO (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T on Monday reported a 46.2% fall in first-quarter operating profit, hurt by lower output at home as it improves its inspection systems, and falling demand in India, its biggest market.Japan’s fourth-largest automaker posted an operating profit of 62.7 billion yen ($592 million) for the April-June quarter, down from 116.5 billion yen a year earlier and below a mean forecast of 69.09 billion from eight analysts, according to Refinitiv.Suzuki reaffirmed its forecast for full-year operating profit to come in at 330 billion yen, up 1.7% from the year ended March 2019.(Graphic: Suzuki Motor operating profit, vehicle sales - tmsnrt.rs/2ynlY7C)Suzuki, known for its Swift and Baleno compact models, is bracing for subdued growth this year in India, where roughly one in two cars sold carries its brand.The company stuck to a forecast for vehicle sales to increase slightly on the year, but conceded that it may need to trim its forecasts in the coming months as slowing economic growth and stricter emissions standards could dent sales.Slowing profit growth could hamper its ability to invest in and develop lower-emissions vehicles and on-demand transportation services necessary to survive the technological upheaval currently underway in the global auto industry.The automaker has long acknowledged that it cannot shoulder the costs of developing electric vehicles and self-driving cars on its own, and has turned to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to supply Suzuki vehicles with its gasoline hybrid systems.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it is recalling about 760,000 RAV4 utility vehicles and 18,000 Lexus HS 250h hybrid cars in the United States to correct problems in their rear suspension that could arise when taken in for maintenance.The RAV4 cars were made from model years 2006 through 2011, while only 2010 models of the HS 250h were affected.Toyota said that if nuts on the rear suspension arm are not tightened properly during a rear wheel alignment service, rust could form, leading to wear and possibly cause the arm to separate.The car maker will inspect the tightened nut on the recalled vehicles to make sure they meet the proper torque specification.The models carry no design or production-related defects and would not need to be inspected unless alignment work was done, a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said. The company is looking into specific measures to prevent errors during maintenance.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a defect investigation opened June 4 into a similar problem with 2006-2008 Toyota RAV4s, said the rear suspension arm assembly “may fail due to corrosion, potentially causing a loss of vehicle control.”The federal agency said at the time it was probing about 460,000 RAV4s. NHTSA said it had received seven complaints alleging corrosion-related failure of suspension arms on the RAV4.	2.206932364

(Adds comment from Lexus president)SHANGHAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Executives at Toyota Motor Corp said the Chinese government is taking an “initial�� look into the auto parts policies of its premium brand Lexus as regulators conduct probes into possible monopoly behaviour across the industry.Two Beijing-based Toyota executives said the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is making initial enquiries about Lexus via the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), which has been conducting an industry-wide survey since April.Nearly all of the survey questions were focused on Lexus’s spare and replacement parts policies, including pricing, the executives said.“At one point during the long process of answering all questions in the survey, CADA people told us the regulators mean business this time, and told us to take the survey seriously,�� one of the executives said.China is ramping up efforts to bring foreign companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008, having taken aim at industries as varied as milk powder and jewellery. Regulators have recently widened their probes to sectors including pharmaceuticals, electronics and autos.Earlier this week, Chinese regulators said they would punish Volkswagen AG’s Audi brand and Fiat SpA’s Chrysler for monopoly practices, potentially paving the way for the automakers to be fined up to 10 percent of their local annual revenue in the world’s biggest car market.According to the two executives, Toyota’s legal department in Beijing has provided written answers and evidence in “several thick binders��. The survey was capped by a visit by a CADA official to Lexus’s office in Beijing last month, they said.The executives said their understanding is that CADA earlier this year had sent similar surveys to a dozen other foreign brands operating in China.“In our case, the inquiry focused on spare parts. They asked about our spare parts prices, whether or not dealers are able to procure spare parts from any supplier, among other things,�� said one of the two Toyota executives, both of whom asked not to be identified because the inquiry is ongoing.“Our guess is that they wanted to make sure we’re not too tightly controlling provision of spare parts to dealers, making sure dealers are allowed to buy spare parts not just from Lexus but other sources.”Tokuo Fukuichi, President of Lexus International and a Director of Toyota, told reporters in Japan that the automaker would cooperate with Chinese authorities.“I have heard that our Chinese office is handling queries from the authorities,�� he said at Toyota’s Miyata plant in southern Japan but declined to comment further.Earlier this week, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz unit said it was cooperating with China’s anti-monopoly authorities over an investigation into unspecified matters, after Chinese media reported the German carmaker’s Shanghai office had been raided.Lexus brings in from Japan and elsewhere outside China all of the vehicles it sells in China. Last year, it sold about 73,000 vehicles. (Additional reporting by Maki Shiraki in Miyawaka, Japan; Editing by Ryan Woo and Jane Merriman)	-0.6166495375
BEIJING, Oct 8 (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s auto sales in China climbed only 1.7 percent in September, barely benefiting from its Japanese rivals�� plunging sales, in contrast to European and South Korean carmakers.Deliveries of GM’s ‘Wuling�� micro vans, a brand which accounts for nearly half of GM’s China sales, came to 119,510, up a marginal 0.4 percent from a year earlier as a weak Chinese economy hurt small business owners, the Wuling’s key buyers.Sales at GM’s car venture with SAIC Motor Corp edged up 3.7 percent, compared with a 17.4 increase in September 2011.GM appears to have missed an opportunity to step into the gap left by Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co, whose sales have fallen as a result of an outbreak of anti-Japanese sentiment in China, analysts said.“German and Korean players are the biggest beneficiaries from the woes of the Japanese as they are much more competitive in the SUV segment,�� said John Zeng, Asia Pacific director for industry consultancy LMC Automotive.Sales of Japanese cars in China have dropped since protests erupted across the country in mid-September over the Japanese government’s purchase of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.Toyota’s China sales fell 40 percent in September from a year earlier, and sales at Mazda Motor Corp were down 35 percent.BMW, however, boosted its China sales by 55 percent in the month, Audi by 20 percent and Mercedes-Benz by 10 percent.For the first nine months of 2012, GM’s sales in China were up 10 percent to 2.08 million vehicles.	3.010780962
WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japan’s NGK Insulators Ltd , which makes parts needed in automotive catalytic converters, has agreed to pay $65.3 million for fixing the prices of parts supplied to car makers and to plead guilty to criminal charges, the Justice Department said on Thursday.The conspiracy ran from about 2000 to 2010, with the affected parts sold to General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, it said.

WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission on Wednesday said it launched an investigation into whether Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries infringed hybrid electric vehicle patents owned by Baltimore-based Paice LLC.The commission said in a press release that it has not yet made any decisions on the merits of the case.Paice is seeking a cease-and-desist order that would block importation and sales of Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche brand hybrid vehicles in the U.S. market. After a similar ITC complaint against Toyota Motor Corp, Paice struck a licensing deal in 2010 with Toyota that covers 23 hybrid electrical control patents. (Reporting By David Lawder)	6.214235519
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, which introduced most consumers to hybrid technologies with its Prius more than 15 years ago, said on Wednesday that the next generation of that popular series will offer improved fuel economy due to smaller, lighter critical parts that cost less.The next Prius, which is expected in 2015, will include improved batteries and smaller, more powerful electric motors, and will be built on the company’s new global vehicle architecture, Toyota managing officer Satoshi Ogiso said at a company hybrid vehicle event outside Detroit.The next Prius also will have a roomier interior and introduce “advanced safety technologies�� that he didn’t specify.“When the next-generation Prius arrives, it will begin a new era for a broad range of Toyota and Lexus vehicle by marking the arrival of a substantially improved family of hybrid power trains,�� Ogiso, who worked on the first-generation Prius before its 1997 launch, told reporters.Toyota has earned the mantle as the world’s greenest automaker, thanks to the success of its hybrid vehicles like the Prius. The second generation of the Prius was introduced in 2003 and the next redesign came out six years later. Toyota has sold more than 5 million hybrid vehicles globally since the launch of the Prius.The fourth-generation Prius will include batteries with higher energy density, or the relationship between the battery’s output and its dimensions, Ogiso said. He said Toyota has stepped up research, development and production capacity on both nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries.Ogiso also said Toyota has boosted development on new battery technologies such as solid state and lithium air, and studies other chemistries beyond lithium, including magnesium.The next Prius will combine the company’s battery technologies with new electric motors that are smaller in size and feature improved power density, he said. For example, the current Prius motor provides four times the power density of the first generation and the next generation’s power density will be even higher.Ogiso did not say what kind of mileage the next-generation Prius will get, other than it would improve on the current version’s 50 miles per gallon. In the past, Toyota has improved fuel efficiency from generation to generation by about 10 percent.Complementing the improvements in the Prius power train, the next version will be built on the company’s new global architecture - to be shared with sister Toyota vehicles from the Corolla to the Camry - allowing for a lower center of gravity and increased structural rigidity, Ogiso said. He did not provide details on the improved interior, ease of operation or additional safety technologies.While he declined to discuss future product plans, Ogiso said the Prius family does not necessarily need to expand further than it already has. Toyota added the larger Prius V in 2011 and the smaller Prius C last year, as well as a more expensive Prius Plug-In version.Ogiso said the next-generation of the plug-in model, which also was introduced last year, will be developed in parallel with the standard hybrid version.He said Toyota is considering consumer requests for additional all-electric driving range and is developing a new wireless-inductive charging system that would allow consumers to recharge the car’s electric battery without a cable. He said Toyota will begin verification of that system next year.Ogiso also reaffirmed that Toyota’s first commercially available hydrogen fuel cell vehicle will go on sale globally in 2015.	3.341674066
SHANGHAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its China joint ventures sold 72,500 cars in the country in January, up 23.5 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Friday.That shows an improvement from December when sales declined 15.9 percent and the first year-on-year growth since June last year.Japanese car makers saw their China sales drop sharply after violent anti-Japan protests erupted across the country in September after Japan nationalised disputed islands in the East China Sea. China also claims the islands as its own territory.Japanese car makers, including Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, have seen a slow recovery of sales in the country since October.While sales of Japanese brands have been recovering, it would be difficult for them to regain their number one position from German rivals as long as the diplomatic dispute remains unresolved, industry observers say.Toyota, which operates car ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co , aims to sell 900,000 cars in the country this year, up 7.1 percent from a year earlier.

"(Reuters) - Since Tesla Inc TSLA.O announced late last year that it planned to come to market by 2019 with an all-electric Class 8 big rig truck called the Semi, other companies have unveiled their own plans to do the same. Here is a list of the planned vehicles:- Volvo AB VOLVb.ST will begin production of its first fully-electric commercial truck this year, and it is expected to be sold next year for short-haul operations in Europe. The truck maker plans to sell a vehicle based on the same drivetrain technology in North America starting in 2020.Under a deal with California, Volvo will deploy some all-battery Class 8 electric demonstration models in the state next year.- Korea's Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS has partnered with Swiss hydrogen company H2 Energy to sell 1,000 hydrogen fuel-cell electric trucks with a range of around 400 kilometers (249 miles) starting in 2019.Hyundai commercial vehicle director Mark Freymueller told Reuters Hyundai is looking at launching in the United States, China and parts of Europe where regulations restricting diesel trucks will take effect in the years ahead.- U.S.-based Navistar is working with part-owner Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE on electric trucks, along with major suppliers including U.S. engine maker Cummins Inc CMI.N, integrated systems maker Meritor Inc MTOR.N and power management company Eaton Corp ETN.N.Navistar plans to provide tester models with a range of around 100 miles to major customers in 2019 and aims for “low-volume�� production in early 2020, said Denny Mooney, Navistar’s vice president of engineering.- Salt Lake City, Utah-based startup Nikola Motor Company has partnered with suppliers including Bosch Corp ROBSCJ.UL Meritor and Wabco Holdings Inc WBC.N. Nikola's trucks have a range of 500 miles to 1,200 miles depending on the weather, terrain and load, and the company has around $11 billion in pre-orders, CEO Trevor Milton said.Nikola's two largest customers are Anheuser Busch InBev NB ABI.BR, which has pre-ordered up to 800 trucks and trucker U.S. Xpress Enterprises Inc USX.N, which has ordered an undisclosed number. Nikola will build couple of dozen test trucks in 2019, and around 100 more trucks in 2020.- Daimler AG DAIGn.DE will launch its 250-mile range eCascadia in 2021, which is aimed at regional distribution and port services. Daimler said it will deliver a total of 30 prototypes to customers later this year for field-testing and expects to have the trucks in production in 2021.Stuttgart-based Daimler will invest more than 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in R&amp;D for its truck operations by 2019, with more than 500 million euros earmarked for electric heavy-duty commercial vehicles, connectivity and self-driving technology.- Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is testing two prototype hydrogen fuel-cell electric trucks in ""drayage"" operations at California's Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, which are served by more than 17,000 registered trucks.As a key advantage, Toyota claims is its hydrogen cells refuel about as fast as a diesel truck, while battery-electric trucks take hours to recharge.With some funding from the state of California, Toyota will build another 10 semi trucks in cooperation with Paccar Inc PCAR.O unit Kenworth.Toyota executives have declined to provide a timeline for production."	1.836037575
Jan 30 (Reuters) - Japan’s Akebono Brake Industry Co Ltd is seeking a capital infusion from top shareholder Toyota Motor Corp and financial relief from bank lenders as it tries to turn operations around under a private workout scheme, Nikkei newspaper reported on Wednesday.The brake maker had filed for an out-of-court turnaround process with a state-certified third-party body, the daily said.The company, whose earnings took a beating after it failed to secure orders for new models from U.S. automakers, is already in talks with certain partner banks and aims to compile a rehabilitation plan by June, Nikkei added.Akebono was not immediately available for comment outside its regular business hours.Shares of Akebono have fallen more than 40 percent in 2018, but are up about 17 percent so far this year.

NEW DELHI, May 11 (Reuters) - India’s automakers have warned that total automobile sales could fall as much as 45% in the current fiscal year in a worst-case scenario as economic growth slumps due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are seeking government help through the crisis.The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an industry trade body, told government officials last week that if India’s economy contracts by 2% in the year starting April 1, sales of cars, trucks and motorbikes could decline by as much as 45% from a year before.SIAM presented two more scenarios to the government -- one where the economy grows by 2%-3%, which would lead to a 20% decline in auto sales, and a second where growth stagnates from last year, resulting in a 35% decline in sales.The trade body represents most major automakers in India, including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp and the local units of Toyota Motor, Hyundai Motor, Ford and Volkswagen.Global consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co estimated in April that if India’s lockdown was extended until mid-May, the economy could shrink by 2%-3% in the current fiscal year, while rating agency Moody’s said on Friday the country could see 0% growth.India’s auto industry is already reeling, with sales of cars, SUVs, trucks and motorbikes falling 18% last fiscal year to 21.5 million vehicles due to an economic slowdown. The pandemic, which has seen businesses shuttered and people told to stay at home all over the world, is set to make things worse.If the combined decline over two years is 40%-45%, it could push auto sales numbers to their lowest level in a decade, SIAM’s president Rajan Wadhera told road transport ministry officials, according to the recording of a web conference they held last week.During the meeting, auto industry executives sought tax cuts, a one-year delay in implementing certain safety and fuel efficiency regulations, and loans at low interest rates to help the sector revive production and prevent layoffs until sales and revenues pick up.“The biggest problem we are facing right now is cashflow liquidity,�� Mahindra &amp; Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka, a former president of SIAM, said during the meeting.Nearly all automakers recorded zero domestic sales in April after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25 to control the spread of the coronavirus. Since May 4, it has allowed some economic activity to resume in places where there are zero or few cases of people being infected.While a handful of companies like Maruti and Hyundai either plan to or have restarted production, many automakers are still waiting for supply chain disruptions to settle and signs of demand to return before they start manufacturing.

WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. - Denny Hamlin blitzed the Watkins Glen road course with the fastest lap of the day on Saturday to win the provisional pole for Sunday’s Go Bowling at the Glen (3 p.m. ET on NBC, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio), pending post-qualifying inspection on Sunday morning.Hamlin covered the 2.45-mile distance in 70.260 seconds (125.534 mph), edging Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch (125.427 mph) by .060 seconds. First-round leader Chase Elliott was third fastest in the final session at 125.421 mph, just .003 seconds slower than Busch.“I had a great day today, and hopefully we can cap it off tomorrow,�� said Hamlin, who earned his first Busch Pole Award of the season, his first at Watkins Glen and the 27th of his career.Hamlin found NASCAR’s enhanced schedule helpful -- with two practice sessions and qualifying on the same day.“I typically haven’t qualified well here,�� Hamlin said. “A lot of it is because we (traditionally) qualify on a different day than we practice. I think today, being able to use those repetitions and still be hot from practice and have things fresh in your mind -- I just got a little faster each round, so that helped.”Busch’s No. 18 Toyota was the consensus favorite in the garage, and Hamlin was surprised to beat his teammate.“He’s usually pretty good at this stuff,�� Hamlin acknowledged. “But once the 9 (Elliott) and the 18 had gone, and I went behind them, and he (crew chief Mike Wheeler) said we were P1 (fastest time on the board), I felt that we had a good shot at.“But it’s amazing to me how well Kyle hits his marks and doesn’t make mistakes, especially on a one-lap qualifying get-it-done moment.”The starting positions won’t be official until NASCAR inspects the cars before Sunday’s race.Elliott was trending for the pole until the final turn.“I felt like I had a good lap going, and then I got a little loose out of (Turn) 11 and thought I could stay in it,�� Elliott said. “And then I thought I didn’t have any more room -- I don’t know how close it was (to the wall), but it must have been pretty close.“That sucks. I just hate to be that close.”A number of big names fell by the wayside in the first of the two rounds, most notably six-time 2018 winner Kevin Harvick, who posted the 16th-fastest speed. Martin Truex Jr., who finished fourth in the first round, bumped out seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson in the final minute.Johnson was just .008 second slower than Kasey Kahne, who wound up with the 12th and last transfer position in Round 1.“You hate to be that close and not advance to the second round,�� said Johnson, who expects to race well on Sunday. “But the 9 car (Elliott) has great speed.”Brad Keselowski, a perennial contender at the WGI road course, qualified 18th, and Clint Bowyer posted the 19th-fastest speed.Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Qualifying - Go Bowling at The GlenWatkins Glen InternationalWatkins Glen, New YorkSaturday, August 4, 20181.

* Toyota win Le Mans for third year in a row* Third wins for Nakajima and Buemi, second for Hartley (Updates after finish)LE MANS, France, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Toyota celebrated a third successive victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race on Sunday with Kazuki Nakajima taking the chequered flag in the number eight car to complete a personal hat-trick.It was also a third triumph in a row at the famed Sarthe circuit for the Japanese driver’s Swiss team mate Sebastien Buemi in the last Le Mans before the start of a new Hypercar era in 2021.New Zealander Brendon Hartley, who replaced double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso in the eight car lineup after the Spaniard’s wins in 2018 and 2019, previously won with Porsche in 2017.The race, first held in 1923 and now in its 88th edition, was held for the first time without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Last year’s event attracted 250,000, many of them British motor racing fans making the trek to the circuit in northwest France.“We miss the fans. It doesn’t feel quite the same as it normally does,�� said Hartley, before clambering onto the roof of the winning car with Buemi when Nakajima brought it back to the pitlane.“To win it with two different manufacturers feels amazing. I feel at home here, I love it.”Swiss-based Rebellion Racing’s number one R13 Gibson car driven by Brazilian Bruno Senna, American Gustavo Menezes and France’s Norman Nato, finished second and Toyota completed the podium with their number seven car.That meant heartache for Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi, Britain’s Mike Conway and Argentine Jose Maria Lopez, runners-up to the sister car in the last two years, after starting from pole position.Toyota, the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category and again crowned World Endurance Champions, had led one-two as night fell over the circuit on Saturday but the order was soon to change.The number seven car lost half an hour in the garage with a turbo problem that could have proved terminal just after the halfway mark.That dropped the number seven to fourth overall but they managed to overhaul the number three Rebellion to secure a podium finish in a race that stayed dry throughout.United Autosports�� number 22 car finished fifth to win the LMP2 category with Britons Paul di Resta and Philip Hanson along with Portugal’s Filipe Albuquerque.Aston Martin secured the FIA GT Manufacturers�� World Championship.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp is seeking more investments in Israeli robotics and vehicle technologies after its venture arm led a $14 million investment in Intuition Robotics in July.The startup, which makes robots for the elderly, was the first Israeli investment for Toyota AI Ventures, a new $100 million fund investing in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous mobility and data and cloud computing.“We will see more involvement of Toyota in the Israeli market in the future,�� said Jim Adler, managing director of California-based Toyota AI Ventures, which is part of the $1 billion Toyota Research Institute.“There’s more in the pipeline,�� he told Reuters during a visit to Israel, adding that technologies dealing with perception and prediction and planning were of particular interest to Toyota.Perception technology enables a self-driving vehicle to understand the world around it while prediction and planning can help a car interpret situations such as whether a child at an intersection might try to cross at a red light.“There’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening in Israel as cars become more produced by data,�� said Adler, who is in the country meeting companies whose technologies interest Toyota.Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Earlier this year Intel Corp bought autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye - one of Israel’s biggest tech companies - for $15.3 billion.On Friday Germany’s Continental AG said it was buying Israel’s Argus Cyber Security, whose technology guards connected cars against hacking.Toyota AI Ventures has made five investments and expects to invest in at least 20 companies worldwide.Regarding its investment in Intuition Robotics - which plans to begin trials of its robots with older adults in their homes early next year - Adler said there were many common features between robotics and autonomous vehicles, which he referred to as “big robots with wheels��.Japan’s population is aging, with 40 percent expected to be over 65 in 20 years, he said, and there will be demand for technologies that help the elderly stay in their homes, rather than have to move to assisted-living facilities.“We think Toyota will have a role there,�� he said.	-2.117328664
* NUMSA strike affects Ford’s Pretoria plant* Toyota says to halt some production from Tuesday* Smaller UASA union says likely to accept offer this week (Adds comments from head of Ford in South Africa)CAPE TOWN, July 14 (Reuters) - U.S. motor company Ford has suspended production at one of its South African plants and Japanese car-maker Toyota plans to follow suit as a manufacturing workers�� strike hits suppliers of car components.The two-week-old strike by 220,000 NUMSA union members, who are seeking 12-15 percent annual increases, follows on the heels of a five-month strike in the platinum sector that stunted economic growth and export earnings.The strike, which has hit the supply of beverage cans made by packaging firm Nampak, has damaged wider investor sentiment in Africa’s most advanced economy, which is teetering on the brink of recession after a first-quarter contraction caused in part by the platinum strike.Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s cut South Africa’s credit rating last month while Fitch put it on negative watch, both citing poor growth prospects mainly because of strikes.Ford spokeswoman Alicia Chetty said: “Production at our Silverton assembly plant has been temporarily suspended due to the strike.�� She said only the company’s Pretoria plant was affected and its other plant in Port Elizabeth was operating normally.Jeff Nemeth, Ford’s South Africa head, told Talk Radio 702 suspension at the plant - which assembles the Ford Ranger pick-up truck - would mean the loss of about 350 units a day.Nemeth said continued disruptions in the flow of products might affect corporate investment decisions in Africa’s most developed but ailing economy.Toyota said it would halt some production from Tuesday because of supply chain problems related to the stoppage.“Toyota will close two production lines from Tuesday at our Durban plant,�� spokeswoman Mary Willemse said.The manufacturing strike also forced General Motors to close its assembly plant in the southern city of Port Elizabeth over a week ago, despite efforts by Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant to mediate between the union and employees.“CRITICAL”Mercedes Benz said supply lines to its assembly factory were reaching “critical�� stress levels and an industry body warned more car-makers could be forced to halt production.“Things are beyond dire. We have exhausted stockpiles we managed to build up in the months leading up to this strike and I expect more companies to halt production should the strike continue,�� Ken Manners, vice president of the auto component manufacturing body NAACAM told Reuters.Production at BMW, VW and Nissan was normal, although company officials said on Monday they were monitoring the situation closely.Those affected include construction companies Murray &amp; Roberts and Aveng Ltd, which are working on the construction of two major power plants for state power utility Eskom.NUMSA rejected the latest pay offer from employers in the steel and engineering sector on Sunday and called on its striking members to intensify the industrial action.Employers have offered pay rises of 10 percent in the first year, 9.5 percent in the second year and 9 percent in the third year. But unions also have grievances about the role of labour brokers in industry and do not want to be bound to a multi-year agreement, preferring a one-year deal instead.NUMSA met the main employer body, Steel and Engineering Industries of South Africa (SEIFSA), on Monday to formally reject the offer.Spokesman Castro Ngobese said SEIFSA - which said on Friday it would take its latest offer off the table if it is rejected - has taken his union’s latest demand to its members for consideration.“Meanwhile the strike continues indefinitely,�� Ngobese said, adding union leaders were due to meet on Tuesday to consider ways to intensify the strike.Smaller union United Association of South Africa (UASA), which represents about 20,000 workers in the sector, said it was awaiting a reply from employers on questions about the offer.“We expect an answer by tomorrow and that will put us in a position to say if we accept or reject it but chances of accepting look good,�� Johan van Niekerk, UASA spokesman, said.Separately, about 200 workers downed tools at unlisted Cape Town-based wine maker DGB, demanding a 10 percent wage hike, union leaders said. DGB, which makes some well-known brands, is offering a 7 percent raise.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T erased a black mark on its reputation for quality on Thursday when Consumer Reports restored a recommended rating for the flagship Camry sedan less than two months after the influential magazine had pulled the rating due to poor crash test results a year ago.The 2014 Camry was retested this month by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and its rating raised from poor to acceptable in a year-old IIHS test procedure.The group said the Camry was rated a top safety pick “after Toyota made changes to the structure of the front end for 2014 models built after November 1,�� according to IIHS spokeswoman Kristin Nevels.Consumer Reports said it was reinstating its recommended rating “based on the Camry’s performance in the latest IIHS small frontal-overlap test��. The procedure is designed to emulate a collision involving the front corner of a vehicle and another vehicle or large object.In late October, the influential magazine said it would no longer recommend the Camry, the Prius v hybrid or the RAV4 sport utility vehicle because they received “poor�� ratings last December in the IIHS small frontal-overlap test.Consumer Reports is one of the most widely trusted names for consumers shopping for cars, and companies try to ensure their vehicles earn the magazine’s coveted “recommended�� rating.The IIHS, a non-profit group funded by the insurance industry, last year increased the rigor of its tests.Consumer Reports waited to adjust its buyer recommendations until it saw how the entire industry was affected by the test.The magazine does not recommend consumers buy a car that fares poorly in any crash tests.Through the first 11 months, Camry was the best-selling passenger car in the United States, with sales of 378,520.In its latest round of testing 2014 models, the IIHS said 22 vehicles received the highest safety rating and another 17, including the Camry, got the next highest rating.Among the redesigned 2014 models that received the top safety pick+ rating were Honda Motor Co's 7267.T Acura MDX and RLX, Nissan Motor Co's 7201.T Infiniti Q50, the Mazda 3 7261.T and the Toyota Highlander.	1.474180777
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei stock average climbed as much as 2 percent on Monday morning, buoyed by a slide in the yen after an upbeat U.S. jobs report raised expectations the Federal Reserve will soon begin unwinding its stimulus.Declines in the yen tend to boost sentiment towards Japanese equities because investors expect the weaker currency will inflate overseas earnings for exporters, such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Sony Corp 6758.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T.Toyota, the fourth-most traded stock on the main board, was up 1.3 percent. Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, the fifth-most traded, gained 3 percent, while Panasonic advanced 1.5 percent.Index heavyweight SoftBank Corp 9984.T, the most traded, climbed 2 percent to a 13-1/2 year high on the back of the upbeat market sentiment.The Nikkei .N225 was up 292.49 points, or 1.9 percent, at 15,592.35 by midmorning after trading as high as 15,610.35. The yen was down 0.1 percent at 103.06 to the dollar, adding to Friday's 1.1 percent slide and edging closer to a six-month low of 103.38 yen touched last week.“There isn’t much of domestic catalyst out there in the near term. The next major catalyst is whether the Bank of Japan is going to ease again in the first quarter of next year and also corporate earnings commencing in another eight weeks�� time,�� said a senior trader at a European bank in Tokyo.“Ahead of that there is very little meat on the bone in terms of domestic factor that is going to drive the market. It’s the currency more than anything else.”Retail investors were piling into social gaming network related stocks, the trader said, with Adways Inc 2489.T, Mixi Inc 2121.T, Gree Inc 3632.T and DeNA Co Ltd 2432.T up between 2.5 and 15.2 percent.Monday’s gain took the Nikkei above its five-day moving average of 15,446.01 and close to a six-month intraday high of 15,794.15 reached last week.U.S. employers added 203,000 jobs last month and the jobless rate hit a five-year low of 7.0 percent, raising the chance that the Fed could cut back on its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying campaign as soon as this month. These expectations are boosting the dollar against the Japanese currency.Meanwhile, strong Chinese exports data added further evidence of stabilisation in the world’s second-largest economy, also boosting risk sentiment in the region.The broader Topix .TOPX index climbed 1.5 percent to 1,254.76, with volume at 25 percent of the full daily average for the past 90 trading days.Adding Monday’s rally, the benchmark Nikkei is up 50 percent this year, heading for its best yearly gain since 1972. Japanese stocks has been driven by the yen’s weakness on the back of Tokyo’s aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus.	-2.107326636
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp moved into damage control mode on Friday after its new communications chief Julie Hamp, an American and its first senior woman executive, was arrested on suspicion of illegally bringing pain killers into Japan just two months after her appointment.Toyota President Akio Toyoda apologized for the incident at a news conference and reiterated the company’s belief that Hamp had no intent of breaking the law.“To me, executives and staff who are my direct reports are like my children,�� he said.“It’s the responsibility of a parent to protect his children and, if a child causes problems, it’s also a parent’s responsibility to apologize.”Japanese media reports, citing police investigators, said 57 addictive Oxycodone pills were found in a small parcel labeled “necklaces�� that was sent from the United States and addressed to Hamp in Japan. The pills were in packets or buried at the bottom of the parcel, which also contained toy pendants and necklaces, they said.Hamp, a former General Motors Co and PepsiCo Inc executive, told police she did not think she had imported an illegal substance, a spokesman for Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police Department said.A police official declined to comment on the latest media reports about the parcel.Hamp was appointed managing officer in April as part of a drive to diversify Toyota’s male-dominated, mostly Japanese executive line-up. She joined Toyota’s North American unit in 2012 and this month relocated to Tokyo, where she was to be based. She had been staying in a hotel, a Toyota spokeswoman said.Toyoda vowed that the automaker would maintain its policy of seeking out talent regardless of gender or nationality and expressed regret that the company had not provided enough support for an employee who was not Japanese and had come to live in Japan.Oxycodone is a prescription drug in both the United States and Japan. Bringing it into Japan requires prior approval from the government and it must be carried by the individual, a health ministry official said.Hiroaki Okamoto, a criminal defense lawyer at the Nakamura International Criminal Defense Office in Tokyo who is not involved in Hamp’s case, said the large number of pills meant that, if indicted, she could face years in prison, followed by deportation.The maximum sentence for smuggling drugs with the intent to sell is life in prison, he said. Even if indicted for smuggling for personal use, it would be tough to get a suspended sentence because of the large number of pills, he said.	1.134159081
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s money stock, or currency in circulation and bank deposits, rose at the fastest annual pace on record in May as companies hoarded cash to guard against slumping sales from the coronavirus pandemic, central bank data showed on Tuesday.The data underscores the disruption the health crisis is causing to corporate activity and the flow of money, leaving policymakers dealing with the stiff challenge of reviving an economy in the throes of a deep recession.A separate private survey showed that nearly 5% of Japanese listed firms tapped banks for funds worth a combined 9.68 trillion yen to cope with the pandemic blow.“Japanese listed firms have had abundant cash but that’s changing as the impact of the pandemic persists,�� Tokyo Research Institute said in the survey released on Tuesday.Japan’s M3 money stock - or currency in circulation and deposits at financial institutions - rose 4.1% in May from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 2004, Bank of Japan data showed.It topped a 3.0% gain in April.Of the total amount, deposits at financial institutions jumped 10.1% in May, the fastest pace of increase since 2017, to a record 770 trillion yen ($7.12 trillion).“Companies are borrowing more amid the coronavirus pandemic and parking money in bank deposits, so they have more cash at hand to meet immediate funding needs,�� a BOJ official told reporters.Nearly 30% of listed firms that tapped banks for funds were manufacturers, including big companies with global operations, and raised roughly 6.6 trillion yen in the wake of a world-wide evaporation of demand, Tokyo Research said.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, among the most cash-rich companies in the world, was the biggest borrower at 1.25 trillion yen, with rivals Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Mazda Ltd MAZD.NS and Honda Motor Co 7267.T also having tapped banks, it said.Japan Airlines Co 9201.T and ANA Holdings 9202.T, as well as some steel makers and railroad operators, were also among big borrowers.“The lending is centred on fairly short-term loans. This suggests that companies were scrambling to meet emergency funding needs due to a rapidly worsening business environment,�� Tokyo Research said.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency in April requesting citizens to stay home and businesses to close.Although the emergency was lifted in late May, analysts expect the economy to recover only moderately from a deepening recession in the face of the pandemic’s sweeping global impact.	-5.176506624
(Adds NHTSA comment)DETROIT, July 16 (Reuters) - German automaker BMW said on Wednesday it is recalling about 1.6 million cars worldwide to replace passenger-side front air bags made by Takata Corp because the inflators could break apart during deployment and injure passengers.The recall affects 3 Series vehicles produced between May 1999 and August 2006.While BMW is still taking part in a regional recall requested by U.S. safety regulators, BMW spokesman Dave Buchko said it decided to recall all of the model year 2000 through 2006 cars potentially affected by the issue. The regional recall requested in June by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covered both passenger- and driver-side front air bags.The recall is an extension of last year’s recall of 240,000 cars globally for the same issue. However, it overlaps with the regional recall.“As a precaution, we just feel now that the right thing to do is just to bring them all in and replace the passenger-side air bag,�� Buchko said.The air bags were supplied by Japan’s Takata, which has seen more than 12 million vehicles recalled over the past five years for related issues.Also affected by the regional recall were Honda Motor Co , Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Fuji Heavy Industries -owned Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Chrysler brand.Subaru’s recall of almost 9,000 cars was national from the start, while Honda’s regional recall hit more states than NHTSA requested. Honda said there was no change to its position and its investigation was ongoing.Nissan said a decision for a broader recall has not been made yet and the number of cars affected in the designated regions was still being determined. Mitsubishi said there was no change in status as the issue was still being investigated.Mazda said it would decide whether to expand the regional campaign after its engineers evaluated the air bag inflators already recalled. A Toyota spokeswoman said the company has not expanded the recall.A Chrysler spokesman said the automaker is still investigating the issue, which potentially affects about 298,000 older vehicles in the four regions NHTSA designated.Ford said its position has not changed and it is cooperating with safety officials. It previously said the regional recall affected 58,669 vehicles.NHTSA said it was aware of BMW’s decision to expand its recall, but that was different from the regional recalls.BMW is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue. The cars previously recalled are not part of this campaign.In the latest recall, about 574,000 of the cars were sold in the United States, 450,000 in Germany and 189,000 in the United Kingdom. Last year, BMW recalled 42,000 cars in the United States for this issue.In addition, BMW said it has also recalled 26 Mini cars and one BMW i3 from model year 2014 to replace Takata passenger-side air bags. These are not part of the larger recall. (Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Detroit and Thomas Atkins in Frankfurt; editing by Maria Sheahan, Nick Zieminski and Matthew Lewis)	-0.9883426254
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to sell electric car technology to Singulato, its first deal with a Chinese electric vehicle startup, allowing the fledgling firm to speed up development of a planned mini EV.In return, Toyota will have preferential rights to purchase green-car credits that Singulato will generate under China’s new quota system for all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.It will also gain a bird’s-eye view into how Chinese EV startups operate and the strategies they pursue in a fast-changing marketplace, said Singulato Chief Executive Shen Haiyin and two sources at the Japanese automaker.“With electrification, autonomous driving and car-sharing shaking up the industry, old ways need to be re-examined,�� one of the Toyota sources said, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.“We have a century’s lead in automotive technology, but we also need to be humble enough to learn from newcomers.”Singulato will acquire a license to use the design of Toyota’s eQ - a battery electric microcar. The deal is due to be announced on Tuesday at the Shanghai auto show, where Singulato will unveil a concept car based on the eQ.Singulato plans to redesign the car, tailoring it to local tastes to come up with a model by early 2021 that is more affordable and offers a longer driving range.“This deal gives us a way to save on time and costs to develop a reliable car and focus on what we excel in,�� Shen told Reuters.Financial terms are not expected to be disclosed. A Singulato source said the startup agreed to pay “several tens of millions of dollars�� for eQ’s design.Toyota said it was taking various measures to accelerate its business in China, a key market, but it would not comment on specific steps.The agreement is a vote of confidence by Toyota in Singulato’s prospects, said Shen. Founded in 2014 and backed by Intel Corp and Japanese trading house Itochu Corp, Singulato is one of at least 50 Chinese EV startups seeking to survive in a competitive market.It plans to sell its first self-developed battery electric car called the iS6 this year, competing with models from rival startups like Nio and WM Motor as well as those from global automakers.Singulato’s version of the eQ will be a so-called connected car offering young buyers a host of entertainment, safety and navigation features. The car, which will be called the iC3, will also feature some self-driving technology.Toyota sold about 100 eQ cars in 2012 and then discontinued it due to concerns over the limits of EVs, including their high price tags, short driving range and long charge time. But Singulato believes technological advances, especially in batteries, have made the car much more marketable.Shen said the iC3 should be able to go as far as 250-300 km (160-190 miles) on a single full charge and will be priced around 100,000 yuan ($15,000). Singulato aims to sell 200,000 units over five years.According to the two Toyota sources, the deal is part of efforts to share more technology with China as the Japanese automaker seeks more growth in the world’s largest auto market by beefing up manufacturing capacity and distribution channels.The deal dovetails with Toyota’s announcement this month that it would be offering automakers and suppliers free access to nearly 24,000 patents for EV technologies.Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told Reuters the Japanese automaker intended to become a tier 2 supplier of hybrid systems and that it had already received more than enquiries from more than 50 companies.The green-car credits are also an important part of the Singulato deal.Keen to combat smog, jump-start its own auto industry and lower reliance on imported oil, China is aggressively pursuing the adoption of electric cars. Under a production quota system taking effect this year, automakers are required to produce and sell a certain number of new-energy vehicles in proportion to their overall sales volume.A carmaker that fails to achieve its quotas will have to acquire NEV points from an automaker with surplus credits or face penalties.Toyota has said that initially it won’t be able to meet its quotas without buying credits from others. It has also agreed to produce and help sell a car for GAC Motor, a joint venture partner, to generate credits.According to the Toyota sources, the deal with Singulato has already yielded intriguing glimpses into the thinking of Chinese EV startups and their non-traditional approach to engineering.One such example was Singulato’s idea to look at linking headlights with satellite, cellular network location data and the driver’s planned trip. That could help turn the headlights along the driver’s route for enhanced visibility and driving safety.It might not something Toyota would consider but as an idea, “it was eye-opening,�� one of the sources said.	-1.519507187
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Saturday it plans to resume output at three of its four main auto plants in China next week.The resumption of production had initially been slated for Feb. 3 following the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, but was delayed because of the new coronavirus outbreak in China.Operations at Toyota’s plant in Changchun, Jilin province, and another plant in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, will restart on Monday, while a factory in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin will resume operations on Tuesday, Toyota said.It has yet to be fixed when Toyota’s Chengdu plant in Sichuan province will restart output, the Japanese automaker said.	-14.70081791
Dec 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle U.S. litigation over claims that its vehicles suddenly and unintentionally accelerated, according to court filings made public on Wednesday.The deal, which must be approved by a California federal judge, includes direct payments to customers as well as the installation of a brake override system in about 3.25 million vehicles, plaintiff attorneys said.The terms include a $250 million fund for former Toyota owners who sold vehicles at reduced prices because of bad publicity, and a separate $250 million fund for owners not eligible for the brake override system.Plaintiff attorneys are slated to receive up to $200 million in fees and $27 million in costs, according to court documents.	2.420574887
BEIJING (Reuters) - WeRide, a Chinese autonomous vehicle startup, said on Friday it has become the first autonomous company to start fully driverless vehicle testing in China, as the world’s biggest auto market accelerates development of autonomous technologies.Three-year-old WeRide, backed by Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, said in a statement that it started tests on Wednesday on open roads in a designated area of Guangzhou after the southern Chinese city granted permission.In China, companies such as Toyota-backed Pony.ai, Baidu Inc, and Didi Chuxing are also testing autonomous cars, but all with one or two safety staff onboard. The people onboard take control in unexpected situations.WeRide said it will use a remote centre to take control of their vehicles if needed.In the United States, Alphabet Inc Waymo is testing passenger vehicles without a safety driver. Nuro, another startup, is allowed to test driverless delivery vehicles on a small scale in California.WeRide is pursuing a level 4 autonomous standard, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention. It said its driverless testing fleet comprises 10 Lincoln MKZ sedans.The company, led by former Baidu executive Tony Han, also operates a fleet of more than 40 autonomous taxis and 60 test cars.Automakers and tech companies including Waymo, Tesla Inc and Uber Technologies are investing billions in the autonomous driving industry.But industry insiders have said it would take years for the technology to mature and for the public to trust autonomous vehicles.	4.481075458

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said he was paid 988 million yen ($10.1 million) in the financial year that ended in March, little changed from the previous year and putting him among the highest-paid executives in Japan.The 0.1 percent increase in Ghosn's annual compensation came after Japan's second-biggest automaker saw its operating profit margin decline to 5.4 percent last financial year, lagging rivals Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T.Ghosn’s compensation, which excludes stock options, is higher than that of his peers at other Japanese companies, who tend to have risen through the ranks over their careers.Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota, the world’s best-selling carmaker, was paid 184 million yen ($1.9 million) for the year ended in March.Ghosn, who is also CEO of Renault SA RENA.PA, has led Nissan since 2001.

TOKYO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp are set to launch a joint venture next year to produce batteries for electric vehicles (EV) in an effort to compete with Chinese rivals, a source familiar with the matter said.The joint venture, to be owned 51 percent by Toyota and the rest by Panasonic, could also provide batteries to Toyota’s EV technology partners Mazda Corp and Subaru Corp , the source said on Sunday.The source declined to be identified because the talks on the joint venture are private.A joint venture would build on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement.Toyota and Panasonic each said the plan to set up a joint venture, first reported by the Nikkei business daily on Sunday, was not what they have publicly announced.A Toyota spokesman said the two companies have been working on the battery partnership announced in 2017. Panasonic made the same comment in a statement.Under a planned joint venture, Panasonic would shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for U.S. EV maker Tesla Inc will remain under the company, the source said.Panasonic already makes prismatic batteries for Toyota, whereas for Tesla, it makes cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops.The two companies may announce the joint venture plan as early as this week, according to the source.The battery joint venture will help Toyota achieve an annual sales target of around 1 million zero-emission battery EVs and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) by 2030.It will also give Panasonic cost and scale advantages in battery production at a time when China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology has grown to be on par with the long-time industry leader on the back of the rapidly growing home market.

TOKYO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - China, Japan and South Korea have set ambitious targets to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by the end of the next decade at a cost of billions of dollars.But to date, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have been upstaged by electric vehicles, which are increasingly becoming a mainstream option due to the success of Tesla Inc’s luxury cars as well as sales and production quotas set by China.Critics argue FCVs may never amount to more than a niche technology. But proponents counter hydrogen is the cleanest energy source for autos available and that with time and more refuelling infrastructure, it will gain acceptance.China, far and away the world’s biggest auto market with some 28 million vehicles sold annually, is aiming for more than 1 million FCVs in service by 2030. That compares with just 1,500 or so now, most of which are buses.Japan, a market of more than 5 million vehicles annually, wants to have 800,000 FCVs sold by that time from around 3,400 currently.South Korea, which has a car market just one third the size of Japan, has set a target of 850,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. So far, fewer than 3,000 have been sold.Hydrogen’s proponents point to how clean it is as an energy source as water and heat are the only byproducts and how it can be made from a number of sources, including methane, coal, water, even garbage. Resource-poor Japan sees hydrogen as a way to greater energy security.They also argue that driving ranges and refuelling times for FCVs are comparable to gasoline cars, whereas EVs require hours to recharge and provide only a few hundred kilometres of range.Many backers in China and Japan see FCVs as complementing EVs rather than replacing them. In general, hydrogen is seen as the more efficient choice for heavier vehicles that drive longer distances, hence the current emphasis on city buses.Only a handful of automakers have made fuel cell passenger cars commercially available.Toyota Motor Corp launched the Mirai sedan at the end of 2014, but has sold fewer than 10,000 globally. Hyundai Motor Co has offered the Nexo crossover since March last year and has sold just under 2,900 worldwide. It had sales of around 900 for its previous FCV model, the Tucson.Honda Motor Co Ltd’s Clarity Fuel Cell is available for lease, while Daimler AG’s GLC F-CELL has been delivered to a handful of corporate and public sector clients.Buses are seeing more demand. Both Toyota and Hyundai have offerings and have begun selling fuel cell components to bus makers, particularly in China.Several Chinese manufacturers have developed their own buses, notably state-owned SAIC Motor, the nation’s biggest automaker, and Geely Auto Group, which also owns the Volvo Cars and Lotus brands.A lack of refuelling stations, which are costly to build, is usually cited as the biggest obstacle to widespread adoption of FCVs. At the same time, the main reason cited for the lack of refuelling infrastructure is that there are not enough FCVs to make the stations profitable.Consumer worries about the risk of explosions are also a big hurdle and residents in Japan and South Korea have protested against the construction of hydrogen stations. This year, a hydrogen tank explosion in South Korea killed two people, which was followed by a blast at a Norway hydrogen station.Then there’s the cost. Heavy subsidies are needed to bring prices down to levels of gasoline-powered cars. Toyota’s Mirai costs consumers just over 5 million yen ($46,200) after subsidies of 2.25 million yen. That’s still about 50% more than a Camry.Automakers contend that once sales volumes increase, economies of scale will make subsidies unnecessary.($1 = 108.15 yen)	1.215049041
NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. 7203.T is moving its U.S. sales headquarters from southern California to suburban Dallas, according to two people familiar with the company's plans.The relocation likely will bring much of the Japanese automaker’s far-flung U.S. operations under one roof, including sales, service, marketing, advertising, manufacturing and quality, the people said.Texas Governor Rick Perry has made luring businesses from other states a priority, making personal recruiting trips to sell what the Republican touts as a superior business climate, particularly lower taxes.Toyota is not the first company to announce plans to leave California for Texas. In February, Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY.N said it would move from Los Angeles to Houston.Details of the move were shared Friday with senior Toyota executives, the people said. Toyota employees received an email Sunday informing them of a Monday morning webcast from Jim Lentz, chief executive of Toyota North America, they said.Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp would not confirm the move, but confirmed employees were invited to a webcast Monday and said details would be provided at that time.The new Texas headquarters is expected to house at least three subsidiaries, the people said, including Toyota Motor Sales USA, Toyota Financial Services and Toyota Engineering and Manufacturing North America. The move will begin in August and will take place in stages through the end of 2016, they said.Employees in Toyota’s Torrance offices and other U.S. locations will be offered relocation packages and financial assistance, they said.Toyota, which established operations in California in 1957, is the second Japanese automaker to relocate from the Los Angeles area.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T in 2006 moved most of its operations to Franklin, Tennessee, outside Nashville.Toyota has a truck assembly plant in San Antonio, Texas, as well as manufacturing and assembly plants in eight other states, including Kentucky, Indiana and Mississippi.Texas Governor Rick Perry has made luring businesses from other states a priority, making personal recruiting trips to sell what the Republican touts as a superior business climate, particularly lower taxes.Perry last month visited California on a recruiting trip and last week was in New York on a poaching trip for the second time in a year. While in Albany, New York’s capital, Perry challenged New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, to a debate over which of the two states had the better business climate, according to the New York Daily News.	3.711627907
TOKYO, April 12 (Reuters) - Embattled air bag maker Takata Corp has begun looking for a financial backer amid a global recall of its potentially lethal air bags, and plans to draw up a list of candidates by August, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.A third-party panel of financial and legal advisers formed by Takata earlier this year is approaching companies, including those in the automotive industry, seeking financial aid, the people said.It’s not clear how much funding Takata is looking for, or how any aid would be structured.Takata, whose faulty air bag inflators have been blamed for 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries, triggering a recall of more than 50 million air bags worldwide, declined to comment on the plan.The Japanese firm could face a bill topping $3.5 billion if it is found to be responsible for defective air bag inflators recalled so far, industry experts estimate - far more than its end-2015 assets of about $1.3 billion.The auto industry is waiting for the results of several investigations, including one commissioned by Takata itself into the root cause of air bags that can explode with excessive force and shoot shrapnel inside the vehicle. That could determine how the recall costs will be covered.So far, most of those costs have been borne by automakers including Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, and Ford whose cars are fitted with Takata air bags.Honda and Toyota have said they will stop using Takata air bag inflators in new vehicle models, and are sourcing replacement inflators from alternative suppliers.A spokesman for Honda, which has had the most cars affected by the recall, said it had no plans to provide financial support to Takata. A Toyota spokesman said it had not made any decisions about providing financial support to the supplier.Takata last month informed its automaker customers of its plans to bring in a ��sponsor�� to bolster its finances, and said it hoped to reach an agreement over a restructuring plan by mid-September, the people said, asking not to be identified as the plans are still confidential.Takata is also considering overhauling its management structure and selling overseas subsidiaries as part of a restructuring, other sources have said.Reuters has previously reported that Takata CEO Shigehisa Takada, grandson of the company’s founder, was willing to resign to take responsibility for the recall.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine unit of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is expecting an increase in its output by a tenth this year, catering to strong demand in one of the fastest growing automotive markets in Southeast Asia.The country launched its $600-million automotive incentive program in 2015 to help boost its fledgling auto industry, raise production and catch up with regional rivals.Toyota Philippines, the country’s top car manufacturer and seller, assembles Vios and Innova models in its facility south of Manila and produced a record 55,028 vehicles last year.“We are projecting at the minimum a 10 percent growth,�� Toyota Philippines Vice Chairman Alfred Ty told reporters when asked about the production volume for 2017.The sales allowed Toyota Philippines, a joint venture between Japan's Toyota and local conglomerate GT Capital Holdings Inc GTCAP.PS, to break into the top 10 for highest selling markets of the Japanese car maker.Sales of motor vehicles in the Philippines jumped 24.3 percent to 325,468 units in the January-November period last year. That is the third-largest growth rate in the region behind Singapore’s 45.6 percent and Vietnam’s 30.8 percent growth, data from the ASEAN Automotive Federation showed.	-2.099580084
DETROIT (Reuters) - The Chrysler Group’s Ram 1500 EcoDiesel was named the top full-size pickup truck in the U.S. market and Toyota’s Highlander the top mid-size SUV by Consumer Reports, the magazine said on Tuesday.The Ram 1500 EcoDiesel's superior fuel economy ratings of 20 miles per gallon overall and 27 mpg on the highway helped push it over the top in the competitive field, edging the second-place Ram 1500 V8 and the third-place General Motors Co GM.N Chevrolet Silverado 1500.In Consumer Reports' road tests, the Ram EcoDiesel scored an 82, followed by the Ram 1500 V8 at 81, the Silverado and the Sierra at 80, Ford Motor Co's F.N F-150 EcoBoost V6 at 70, and the F-150 V8 at 69.“The continued interior and powertrain improvements make the Ram a particularly well-rounded choice for most consumers,�� the magazine said in a statement.Pickup trucks are the keys to profit for American automakers.Later this year, Ford will introduce an F-150 with more aluminum and improved fuel economy. The current V8 version gets 15 mpg overall and 22 mpg on the highway, according to Consumer Reports.Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Highlander took the top two spots in its category. The hybrid version was first among midsize SUVs and the gasoline version second.Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee diesel version was third in the ratings, followed by Hyundai Motor Co's 005380.KS Santa Fe and Nissan Motor Co's 7201.T Murano.Toyota last week announced that it would increase production of the Highlander at its plant in Indiana by investing $100 million and adding 300 jobs by the summer of 2016.Consumer Reports says it gathers at least a year of field data on a vehicle’s reliability before it offers a “recommended�� rating.Among full-size pickup trucks, Consumer Reports recommends the Ram 1500 gasoline V8, the Ford F-150 V8, and the Toyota Tundra. The Ram EcoDiesel and the both the Silverado 1500 and the GMC Sierra are too new on the market to have comparative reliability ratings, it noted.Through July, the F-150 pickups were the top-selling vehicles in the U.S. market, followed by the Silverado, the Toyota Camry sedan and the Ram pickups, according to Autodata Corp.Chrysler is a unit of Fiat SpA FIA.MI.	3.254721086

* Carmaker protecting Japan production base for now* Strong yen continues to erode profits on exports* Lexus key to regaining best-seller title in U.S.MIYAWAKA, Japan, July 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor on Friday launched production of its revamped Lexus ES sedan, a flagship luxury car that represents a renewed bet the automaker can keep building cars for the United States and China at more costly factories in Japan.Toyota, Japan’s top automaker, has made it a goal to safeguard production of some 3 million vehicles a year in its home market - roughly triple the equivalent output at Nissan Motor and Honda Motor and about 40 percent of the cars and trucks Toyota builds globally.Lexus is key to that commitment. The only Lexus model made outside Japan is the RX sport-utility vehicle manufactured in Ontario, Canada.“Lexus becomes a product only after the Japanese craftsmanship and technologies are applied, so that’s why I want to stick to it being from Japan,�� said Toyota President Akio Toyoda.“But our basic philosophy is to make products where there is demand...We may have to shift some production abroad in areas that will continue to grow. But I still believe that keeping a certain level of production in Japan will enable us to catch up to and lead the growth of the global automotive industry,�� he told a group of reporters after a ceremony marking the ES production launch.Japanese automakers, including Toyota, have been reeling from a strong yen that has eroded profits on exports. The Lexus strategy leaves the brand more exposed to foreign exchange than Toyota’s mainline brand, but Toyota officials said the made-in-Japan strategy would pay off even at current yen levels.“We have no plans to endure to a point that our business won’t function. But for cars like the ES, we are seeing cost levels that will allow us to continue producing even if the yen is at 80 yen against the dollar,�� said Kazuo Ohara, executive vice president of Lexus International.“Our policy is to protect manufacturing in Japan as much as possible for as long as possible,�� Ohara told reporters, but added that the 80 yen level is still tough for Lexus.Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW already make cars in China, where imported luxury vehicles face tariffs of 25 percent. Nissan plans to start building Infiniti vehicles in China from 2014.“At some point Toyota may have to move production abroad to compete on the cost front,�� said Masatoshi Nishimoto, the manager of Japan and Korea vehicle forecast at IHS Automotive.Nishimoto said Toyota could make such a move within five years and that the firm must drive sufficient global sales growth in the interim in order for it to keep its high-profile domestic production target and also produce more abroad.Toyota expects the all-new ES lineup, including a first-of-its-kind hybrid option, will drive global sales growth of more than 60 percent for its top-selling luxury car.Toyota also sees the launch of the 2013 model as step toward retaking an important bragging right by making Lexus the best-selling luxury brand in the United States, a position it lost in 2011 when the Japan earthquake and tsunami disrupted output.The new ES will not be sold in Japan.The redesign of the ES, built on the Toyota Avalon platform, follows a spate of Lexus revamps this year that are part of a push by Toyota to show it can attract consumers younger than the American “baby boomers�� who made Lexus a hit in the 1990s.The ES competes with BMW’s 3-Series sedan, Mercedes-Benz’s C-class and Infiniti’s G sedan. Mercedes-Benz is Daimler’s premium car brand and Infiniti is Nissan Motor’s luxury brand.Between January to June this year, Toyota sold about 18,270 ES sedans in the United States, up 10 percent compared to the same period in 2011, making it the second-best selling Lexus after the RX SUV.Globally, 74,000 ES vehicles were sold last year, accounting for about 18 percent of the total number of Lexus models sold.The ES will go on sale in August. Toyota is aiming to sell about 10,000 ES vehicles a month, including 5,000 in the United States and 3,000 in China, Ohara told reporters.The ES line, which includes the hybrid option and versions with 2.5-litre and 3.5-litre engines, is likely to be priced around $36,000 to $44,000 in the United States, said Toshio Asahi, a deputy chief engineer at Lexus International.Last year, Toyota sold 404,000 Lexus vehicles, down from a peak of 518,000 in 2007.	1.777161583
* Minicar maker sees market for smaller cars in Brazil* Toyota looks to subsidiary for advice on making lower-cost cars* Toyota, Daihatsu still mulling India strategyTOKYO, June 14 (Reuters) - Daihatsu Motors on Wednesday said it plans to launch compact cars in Brazil, as parent company Toyota Motor Corp looks to its minicar subsidiary to help it expand in emerging markets and produce lower-cost, quality vehicles.Toyota, the world’s No. 2 automaker, wants to apply its smaller partner’s expertise in affordable, reliable pint-sized cars to its own passenger models as it grapples with higher costs and stiff global competition to produce increasingly sophisticated cars.“There’s a market for compact cars in markets like Brazil,�� Daihatsu President Soichiro Okudaira told reporters in Tokyo in comments for publication on Wednesday.“Toyota sells similar models across Asia and South America, and Brazil has been an important market for models like the Corolla, although they were in a slightly larger class.”Okudaira, chief engineer of the last two generations of Toyota’s Corolla series, was dispatched from Toyota earlier this month to lead Daihatsu. He declined to offer additional details on when or in what capacity the carmaker would expand in Brazil.Toyota has a market share of about 9 percent in Brazil, where it sells the Etios subcompact hatchback and the Corolla and Camry sedans, along with SUVs and trucks. Any expansion there will see it come up against market leaders FCA, General Motors Co, and Volkswagen AG.Brazil, a top-10 global market for cars, could be a tough market for expansion as a deepening recession and political uncertainty has sapped auto sales in recent years. The country posted total sales of about 2 million in 2016, having fallen sharply from 3.5 million in 2010.Daihatsu is Japan’s largest maker of minicars with engines no bigger than 660cc made specifically for the domestic market as a low-cost alternative to passenger cars. Toyota has already enlisted Daihatsu to help develop compact cars for emerging markets including India.Toyota President Akio Toyoda last month said he was betting on minicar technology to simplify the way it manufactures regular cars at lower cost. Toyota has set up in-house companies to specialise in small cars and emerging markets, which are big markets for smaller models.Okudaira said the two companies were still mulling their strategy for India and other emerging markets, including whether to launch compact cars under the Daihatsu or Toyota brands and securing a high-quality supply chain.Toyota has struggled to grow its market share at the affordable end of India’s car market, a sector dominated by domestic rival Suzuki Motor Corp.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota 7203.T will not build cars at its British factory the day after Britain leaves the European Union as part of plans to handle any disruption from a potentially disorderly Brexit. The autos sector, Britain’s biggest exporter of goods, has been one of the most vociferous opponents of a no-deal Brexit, warning that production would be hit with tariffs, border delays and new bureaucracy, ruining the viability of plants.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised that Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal.Toyota built just over 8% of Britain’s 1.52 million cars last year at its Burnaston factory in Derbyshire and began production of its new Corolla model there earlier this year.“We will have a production pause on the first day of Brexit, which is Friday 1st, and... then we will restart production on the Monday and the Tuesday,�� said a spokesman.“We don’t know what the actual situation will be like. We’ve already pulled forward a couple of days of extra inventory which we will then use on the Monday and Tuesday and we will have to see what the situation is after that,�� he said.British car factories are integrated into supply chains which can stretch around the world and operate just-in-time manufacturing processes which mean some parts arrive minutes before being fitted onto vehicles rolling off production lines.Toyota said no volume would be lost from the pause in output.	2.219350916
DETROIT, Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales to be reported on Friday are expected to be up 12 percent from a year ago as the federal government shutdown did not greatly impact consumer purchases.Analysts forecast that the largest automakers in terms of U.S. sales will have double-digit percentage sales increases, with the possible exception of sales leader General Motors Co .Pickup truck sales are expected to again show double-digit gains, but the pace may be slower than in recent months before the usual end-of-year flurry of truck buying, analysts said.On a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, October sales will be 15.4 million, according to the average of 44 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That annualized rate would up about 12 percent from the previous October’s new-vehicle sales.The 16-day shutdown of most of the federal government did not keep sales down, several analysts said, including Alec Gutierrez of Kelley Blue Book.“The expectations were that car buyers would wait on the sidelines, but because of pent-up demand and credit availability, car sales are expected to increase 7 percent from last month.”Kelly Blue Book is calling for a year-on-year increase in sales of 12 percent for the industry.Crossover vehicles will show an increase of 26.5 percent, Kelley Blue Book said. Top sellers in the crossover segment of the auto industry so far this year are Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Chevrolet Equinox and Toyota RAV4.Buckingham Research said Ford’s high level of incentives on the F-150 pickup trucks pressured GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup truck sales.Ford bumped up incentive spending 24 percent in October from a year ago, according to industry research firm Edmunds.com, while GM raised incentives only 1.5 percent. Toyota’s incentive spending rose 8.5 percent, while Honda incentives fell 23 percent.While Chrysler’s incentive spending fell 3 percent, it was still the industry leader in per-vehicle spending of over $3,000, according to Edmunds.Elaine Kwel, analyst with Jefferies, said that lower gasoline prices will help boost sales of larger vehicles, which are in general more profitable for automakers. According to the AAA travel group, the average U.S. price for regular gasoline was $3.28 per gallon on Thursday, down 3 percent from a month ago and down 7 percent from a year ago.Industry research firms Kelly Blue Book, TrueCar.com and Edmunds.com each offered estimates of October sales performances of the top automakers in U.S. sales.Edmunds said General Motors Co sales rose 10 percent; Ford Motor Co, up 15.5 percent; Toyota Motor Corp , up 15 percent; Chrysler Group LLC, up 11 percent; and Honda Motor Co, up 13 percent.TrueCar.com, which was more bullish in its industry forecast of a 14-percent gain over last October, showed GM at a 9 percent increase, Ford up 19 percent, Toyota up 13.5 percent, Chrysler up 19 percent and Honda up 16 percent.Kelly Blue Book estimated gains for the top five automakers in U.S. sales, with GM up 8 percent, Ford up 14 percent, Toyota up 16 percent, Chrysler up 12.5 percent, and Honda up 12 percent.	-4.36189889

BEIJING, May 30 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp is moving to set up a joint venture in China with a local Chinese company to produce batteries for the country’s fledgling electric-gasoline hybrid car market, a Beijing-based company spokesman said on Thursday.Takanori Yokoi, Toyota spokesman, said the Japanese automaker is in discussions with Hunan Corun New Energy Co in the southern China province of Hunan to jointly produce nickel-metal hydride batteries for hybrid models Toyota plans to start selling in China around 2015.Toyota previously said it was working to design key hybrid components in China to make those China-only hybrid models more affordable.The move comes as Toyota - and other automakers in China, both indigenous Chinese and foreign - gear up to try to kick-start sales of conventional hybrid cars in China in anticipation of changes in China’s industry policy aimed at nurturing demand for “new energy�� cars to include conventional hybrids.Until now, under the current policy, China provided generous subsidies for private purchases of all-electric battery vehicles and heavily electrified “near all-electric�� plug-in hybrids, but only limited support for conventional hybrids. A growing number of industry insiders and experts believe the Chinese government would boost purchase subsidies significantly for conventional hybrids as early as this year.Toyota’s Yokoi said the Japanese automaker, which has bet big on gasoline-electric hybrid technology since the late 1990s when it began selling the Prius hybrid, plans to launch in China two relatively affordable hybrid models around 2015. One model would be for and marketed by Toyota’s joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co, one of China’s big state-owned auto enterprises. The other would be for its joint venture with another state-owned auto maker FAW Group.China is warming to gasoline-electric hybrid cars as it tackles an addiction to fossil fuels, and local indigenous Chinese car makers are heeding the call.Automakers like state-owned SAIC Motor Corp and Brilliance Auto are developing the fuel-saving technology pioneered by Toyota. Executives at BYD Co, a Chinese battery and automaker part-owned by a Warren Buffett company, have told Reuters the company plans over the next few years to stop selling gasoline-fueled cars and sell only hybrid and other new-energy cars.According to a notice Corun New Energy filed with the Shanghai stock exchange, Toyota and the Hunan-based battery producer plan to set up a joint hybrid battery company in the eastern China city of Changshu.The joint-venture company, which is expected to be called Corun PEVE (China) Automotive Battery Co, would be owned 41 percent by Primearth EV Energy Co, a joint venture between Toyota and Japan’s Panasonic Corp, 5 percent by Toyota’s China unit called Toyota Motor China Investment Co and 4 percent by Toyota affiliate Toyota Tsusho Co. The joint venture is pending approval by the Chinese government.The China side investing in the venture includes Hunan Corun New Energy and Changshu Sinogy Venture Capital Co, which would own 40 percent and 10 percent of the venture, respectively.	4.653339005
DETROIT, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it is recalling about 5,850 cars, most of them in the United States, for possible loss of steering control.The Japanese automaker said it is recalling about 5,650 Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon and Avalon Hybrid cars from model year 2014 in the United States because the left front suspension lower arm could separate from a ball joint and cause the loss of steering control, which could increase the risk of an accident. The rest of the recalled cars were sold in Canada and the Middle East, a spokeswoman said.Toyota said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related to the issue.The company said dealers will replace the suspension arm at no cost and notification of the recall will begin in early December.

* European car sales rise for third month* Year-to-date decline smaller than feared* Renault, Toyota, VW lead advancePARIS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Renault, Toyota and Volkswagen led a 0.9 percent November gain in European car sales, according to industry data published on Tuesday, pulling ahead of Fiat, General Motors and Ford in a slowly recovering market.Registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association trading bloc rose to 975,281 from 966,421 a year earlier, their third straight monthly gain, the Association of European Carmakers said.As the European market nears the end of a sixth consecutive year of decline, industry leaders such as Renault Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn are hopeful the region can return, at least, to modest single-digit growth in 2014.The gradual turnaround will do little to relieve the pressure of excess production capacity that has continued to weigh on European operations, fueling a profit-sapping price war of unusual ferocity.The data “confirms what manufacturers and suppliers have indicated during third-quarter earnings - that the European auto market has stabilised��, Citi analyst Philip Watkins said.“Renault was the standout for the second consecutive month,�� he added in a note to investors.Volkswagen and Renault posted respective increases of 0.8 percent and 2.6 percent for their namesake mid-market brands, and bigger gains in lower-cost cars that helped group sales to rise 3.2 percent and 8.9 percent.The German carmaker, Europe’s No. 1 by volume, recorded an 18 percent increase at its no-frills Skoda division. Low-cost Renault models, such as the Dacia Duster sport utility vehicle, (SUV) surged 30 percent. Toyota registrations rose 6.9 percent.November’s registrations gain pared the region’s year-to-date decline to 2.8 percent - a more modest fall than many in the industry had feared earlier in the year.In March, GM’s Opel was braced for a further 10 percent European market contraction and Morgan Stanley cut its outlook to predict a 6 percent slump.But automakers that lack new models or a low-cost offering are still suffering.Sales by Italy’s Fiat tumbled 5.8 percent across the market of 30 European states as demand for its ageing model line-up fades, leading to an 8 percent contraction so far this year.Fiat chief Sergio Marchionne has delayed multibillion-euro factory investments for long-promised expansions of the upmarket Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands while pursuing a bitter buyout dispute with its 58.5 percent-owned Chrysler division’s minority shareholder.GM sales dropped 3.8 percent as both main brands fell. The U.S. carmaker is withdrawing the underperforming Chevrolet badge from Europe to focus on reviving mid-market Opel.Loss-making French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen recorded a 1.2 percent drop in registrations despite recent model launches, such as its 2008 mini-SUV.Ford also retreated 2.9 percent. In a move designed to lift its brand and margins ahead of a coming model offensive, Ford is cutting back on unprofitable sales to rental companies as well as heavily marked-down vehicles sold as nearly new.The company expects western Europe to return to growth in 2014 after bottoming out this year, Ford of Europe CEO Stephen Odell said last month.	-1.528420357
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T reputation for quality took a hit on Monday when influential magazine Consumer Reports pulled its recommendation on three of the Japanese automaker's vehicles, including its popular flagship Camry sedan, due to poor crash test results.While Toyota’s luxury Lexus and namesake brands were ranked most reliable in the U.S. auto industry in Consumer Reports�� annual new-car reliability survey, the magazine said it will no longer recommend the Camry, Prius v model or RAV4 sport utility vehicle because they received “poor�� ratings in a crash test started last year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.“We’re a year into it, we’ve got over 50 vehicles tested and there’s enough that are doing adequately on this test that now we’re making the shift and pulling recommendations from any car that gets a poor�� rating, Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, said of the IIHS test.“Honestly, we don’t take this lightly, but virtually every vehicle now in the family sedan category has been tested and the only one that has gotten a ‘poor�� is the Camry,�� he added. “At this point, we don’t feel we can continue to recommend people buy a Camry when there’s other good choices out there that do better on the test.”Consumer Reports is one of the most widely trusted names for consumers shopping for cars, and companies try to ensure their vehicles earn the magazine’s coveted “recommended�� rating.Last year, the IIHS, a non-profit group funded by the insurance industry, increased the rigor of its tests to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle. Consumer Reports waited to adjust its buyer recommendations until it saw how the entire industry was affected by the test.The magazine does not recommend consumers buy a car that fares poorly in any crash tests.In the first nine months of the year, the Camry was the third-most-sold vehicle in the United States, behind two full-size pickup trucks. Its sales were up 1.3 percent from the year-ago period to 318,990 cars, compared with an increase of almost 14 percent by rival Honda Motor Co's 7267.T Accord sedan.Toyota has made changes to the Camry to improve its performance in the crash tests and IIHS is planning to retest the car in December, IIHS spokesman Russ Rader said. Companies that have modified a vehicle design sometimes seek a retest.Last December, when IIHS gave the Camry its “poor�� rating, it said the company’s engineers had “a lot of work to do to match the performance of their competitors.�� Toyota officials said on Monday they “are looking at a range of solutions�� to address the car’s performance in the crash test.Last month, Toyota’s Corolla small car, which was redesigned for the 2014 model year, received a “marginal�� rating on the IIHS crash test.In addition to the three Toyota vehicles, Consumer Reports also dropped Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Audi A4 car from its recommended list due to a ""poor"" rating on the IIHS test, Fisher said.Ten other vehicles also lost their recommended status, but that was due to the overall quality of vehicles in their segments and not related to their crash test performances, he said.The IIHS, which continues to score vehicles on side, rear, roll-over and front-end crashes, added an overlap test because nearly one-fourth of U.S. front-of-vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death involve a single corner that strikes another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole.In the overlap test, IIHS crashes a vehicle at 40 miles per hour into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver’s side that overlaps one-quarter of the vehicle’s width.In its annual reliability rankings, Toyota's Lexus was at the top, followed by the Toyota brand. Rounding out the top 10 were Honda's Acura, Audi, Mazda7261.T, Nissan's 7201.T Infiniti, Volvo0175.HK, Honda, General Motors Co's GMC truck brand and Subaru 7270.T.The vehicle with the top predicted reliability score was the 2014 Subaru Forester SUV, while Ford Co's F.N C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid vehicle received the worst score, Consumer Reports said.Two popular models, Honda’s redesigned 2013 Accord with a V6 engine and the 2013 Nissan Altima, scored too poorly for Consumer Reports to continue recommending them.One of the main problem areas in the survey was in-car electronics, including infotainment systems. Of the 17 categories tracked, the area generated the most complaints, including buggy systems with screen freezes, touch control lag or a reluctance to recognize a cell phone or other device.For instance, last year, Ford tumbled to nearly the bottom of the survey due to flaws in its touch-screen navigation and entertainment system, MyFord Touch.This year, continued problems with the infotainment system, as well as several EcoBoost turbocharged V6 models having poor reliability, left Ford's namesake and Lincoln luxury brands ranked No. 26 and 27, respectively, ahead of only BMW'sBMWG.DE Mini. Of the 31 Ford models in the survey, only one, the F-150 pickup with the 3.7-liter V6 engine, was above average, while seven scored average.GM’s Cadillac brand fell the most in the survey, dropping 14 spots to No. 25 as its CUE infotainment system suffered from issues similar to Ford’s. The GM brand also lost the benefit of older cars that typically have fewer problems than newer models.GM’s Buick and Chevrolet brands ranked No. 12 and No. 17, respectively.Smaller U.S. rival Chrysler FIA.MI ranked No. 18, while its Ram truck, Jeep SUV and Dodge brands were No. 19, No. 23 and No. 24, respectively.Tesla Motor Inc'sTSLA.O Model S electric sedan performed well enough in the reliability survey to earn a recommendation for the first time.Consumer Reports said the findings in its survey are based on subscribers�� experiences with 1.1 million vehicles. It uses the findings to compile reliability histories on vehicles and predict how well new cars will hold up."	-3.024428073
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Justice Department investigators have identified criminal wrongdoing in General Motors Co’s failure to disclose a defective ignition switch, and they are negotiating what is expected to be a record penalty, the New York Times reported on Friday.Citing people briefed on the inquiry, the Times said a settlement could be reached as soon as this summer. The final number is still being negotiated, but it is expected to exceed the $1.2 billion paid last year by Toyota for concealing unintended acceleration problems, according to the newspaper.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. agencies are preparing to submit for final White House regulatory review a plan to revoke California’s authority to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas standards and declare that states are pre-empted from setting their own vehicle rules, two people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.The Environmental Protection Agency in August 2018 proposed revoking a waiver granted to California in 2013 under the Clean Air Act as part of the Trump administration’s plan to roll back Obama-era fuel economy standards through 2025.The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are expected to seek approval to finalize the first portion of the rule dealing with California and other states before completing action on setting yearly fuel efficiency requirements. The plan would not revoke California’s ability to set low-emission vehicle standards that has been in place since 1990, the sources said.The move comes as President Donald Trump has expressed anger with automakers over the issue. In July, four major automakers, including Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, said they had reached a voluntary agreement with California on fuel efficiency rules.California and other states had vowed to enforce stricter Obama-era emissions standards, after Trump proposed rolling back the federal rules. Automakers had worried that court battles between state and federal governments could create years of uncertainty for manufacturers.The plan, also backed by BMW AG and Honda Motor Co Ltd, is more stringent than Trump’s proposal but looser than the Obama-era rule. California, the most populous U.S. state, accounts for about 12% of American vehicle sales, and if the administration recognizes the deal, it would allow automakers to operate under one set of rules.An administration official said it was close to submitting a rule internally dubbed the “One National Program rule�� aimed at ensuring a single national level for fuel economy standards. It would also block California from setting zero emission vehicle requirements.On Friday, a federal appeals court in Washington will hear arguments in a suit filed by California and other states challenging the Trump administration’s decision to set aside a 2017 EPA determination under Obama that the 2022-2025 fuel rules were appropriate.Other automakers, including General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp, have declined to back the deal with California. Mary Nichols, who chairs the California Air Resources Board, told Reuters in July that the four automakers had agreed not to legally challenge California’s vehicle regulatory authority.Under Trump, federal regulators backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026. Administration officials say its final regulation will include a modest boost in annual efficiency requirements but far less than what the Obama administration had set in 2012.The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 mpg by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option to freeze requirements.The administration’s proposal said that by the 2030 model year, the average price increase of a new vehicle would be reduced by $1,850 and consumers would pay $490 less for financing, insurance and taxes.The Environmental Defense Fund said Thursday rolling back the rules would cost motorists at least $200 annually in average higher fuel costs.	-0.6815600151

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high in 2016, automakers said on Wednesday, and investors bid up shares in the sector as strong consumer confidence and relatively low fuel prices bolstered the industry’s outlook.Shares of General Motors Co GM.N rose 5.5 percent and Ford Motor Co &lt;F.N) stock rose 4.6 percent, far outpacing the wider Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up only 0.3 percent.Autodata Corp said 2016 U.S. auto sales of 17.55 million were 0.4 percent higher than the previous record set in 2015.December sales rose 3 percent, and on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis were 18.43 million vehicles, Autodata said. That widely beat expectations of economists polled by Thomson Reuters of 17.7 million vehicles.The results prompted executives from the three biggest sellers in the U.S. market, GM, Ford, and Toyota Motor Corp, 7203.T, to predict that this year's sales will be near 2016's record levels.U.S. consumer confidence reached levels not seen in 15 years in December. Auto sales are an early indicator of consumer spending, and account for about a fifth of U.S. retail spending.GM’s December sales rose 10 percent, Ford was up 0.3 percent and Toyota increased 2 percent. All three automakers�� results, lifted by strong demand for pickup trucks and SUVs, beat Wall Street expectations.Ford said it sold 87,512 F-Series pickups in December, the lineup’s best overall sales month in 11 years. The F-series was the best-selling model line in the United States last year, for the 40th year in a row.Rogue, a compact SUV from Nissan Motor Co, 7201.T in December was the fourth best-selling model in the U.S. market and showed a sales increase of 53 percent from a year earlier. Pickups and SUVs accounted for 59.5 percent of 2016 auto sales, up from 55.8 percent in 2015.Pickup trucks and compact SUVs held the first six spots in the monthly top-selling models list, as reported by the automakers.Strong consumer discounts, also called sales incentives, also helped December’s sales.December consumer discounts averaged about $4,000 per vehicle, up by about $500 from a year earlier, according to J.D. Power data provided to Reuters.Discounts erode automakers�� profits but GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose $740 from November to $36,386 in December, reflecting in part strong sales of large SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe. That is important to investors because Detroit’s automakers make the bulk of their global profits from sales of trucks and SUVs in North America.Industry executives have cautioned for several months that the U.S. market’s post-financial crisis recovery was due for a slowdown, but such concerns seem to be easing.“Key economic indicators, especially consumer confidence, continue to reflect optimism about the U.S. economy and strong customer demand continues to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry,�� said Mustafa Mohatarem, GM’s chief economist.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU.N&gt;FCHA.MI was a laggard in December, as its sales slid 10 percent. FCA's Jeep brand reported sales down 6 percent.	-5.919960146
(Adds details on Tesla’s new autonomous car)TOKYO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc and Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s best-selling automaker, could sign a new deal over the next two to three years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, as the two firms ready to end an existing programme.California-based Tesla has been supplying batteries and motors for Toyota’s RAV4 electric SUVs that went on sale in 2012, but that partnership is set to end this year after Toyota sold just 2,000 of the vehicles.“If you look at maybe two or three years from now, I would not be surprised if there is a significant deal with Toyota and Tesla,�� Musk told a news conference on Monday in Tokyo where he made the first deliveries of the Model S luxury electric sedan in Japan.He said the deal involve higher volumes than the existing partnership but did not comment on the details of what the deal could involve and said there were no definitive plans.A Toyota executive also said no specific plans were in place but added the two companies hadn’t ended their relationship.“There are still possibilities in certain areas of their operations especially in North America where we may find common ground,�� said the executive, who declined to be named. “It’s not like we have severed our ties.”Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the company could not comment on the matter.Tesla is planning an autonomous driving system, with part of the technology to be introduced in three years�� time, the Nikkei reported, citing Musk.The company will start introducing the technology in cars slated to go into production three years from now. These cars are likely to cost around $35,000, the Nikkei said.That is about half the starting price of Tesla’s first mass-market car, the Model S sedan.Tesla will make fully autonomous cars in the next five to six years, the Japanese newspaper said.In 2010, Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory in California after Toyota closed the plant and currently manufactures the Model S there. In return, Toyota took a $50 million stake in Tesla.In Japan, one of the first customers that received the model S - which costs around 7.4 million yen ($70,300) after subsidies - was Panasonic Corp’s Executive Vice President, Yoshi Yamada.Panasonic is set to fund part of the cost of a new $5 billion battery factory that Tesla is building in Nevada. Musk repeated the Japanese electronics maker is likely to fund 30 to 40 percent of the total cost.Panasonic also reiterated it wouldn’t comment on the size and timing of the investment.Asked whether Panasonic would cover 30 to 40 percent of Tesla’s battery plant, called the Gigafactory, Yamada told reporters: “Isn’t that all speculation?�� ($1 = 105.2900 Japanese yen) (Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bangalore; Editing by Chris Gallagher, Mark Potter and Joyjeet Das)	-0.4347070075

WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - Four major automakers will not take a position on legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision in March to dramatically weaken Obama-era fuel economy standards but want to weigh in on any court fix, according to a document seen by Reuters.The Trump administration in March finalized rollback of U.S. vehicle emissions standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That is far weaker than the 5% annual increases in the discarded rules adopted under President Barack Obama.Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Co and BMW AG struck a voluntary agreement with California in July 2019 on vehicle emissions rules. On Friday, the four automakers plan to ask a U.S. Appeals Court in Washington for permission to be heard in the court challenge “to ensure that any remedy imposed by this court is both appropriate and achievable,�� according to a draft of the filing. Other major automakers like General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp have sided with the Trump administration on the rollback. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Dan Grebler)	0.5358972338
TORONTO/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Olympic organizers joined calls for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, while the International Olympic Committee, according to member Dick Pound, has decided to delay the event, likely for a year.Major sporting nations Australia and Canada withdrew on Monday as organizers came under mounting pressure to postpone the event for the first time in its 124-year modern history.The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee said it had listened to feedback from athletes and was encouraged by a clearer path toward postponement.“Our most important conclusion from this broad athlete response is that even if the current significant health concerns could be alleviated by late summer, the enormous disruptions to the training environment, doping controls and qualification process can’t be overcome in a satisfactory manner,�� the USOPC said in a statement on Monday.Pound told Reuters a one-year postponement looked like the best solution. This would mean the Games, scheduled for July 24-Aug. 9, are likely to be held in the summer of 2021.“That’s my conclusion (there will be a postponement),�� Pound said in a telephone interview, after Sunday’s IOC statement saying it was stepping up its “scenario planning�� for the Tokyo 2020 Games - including a possible postponement.“From reading IOC-speak in the communique, if you are going to cancel you simply cancel because there are no future plans,�� added Pound.“But if you are going to carry on with the original objective (to stage the Games) there is no reason to issue a statement because you have already done that over the past several weeks.”Japan and the IOC have said calling off the Games entirely is not an option. But finding a new date could be complicated as the summer 2021 calendar is already crowded, while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.Japan’s government is negotiating with the IOC to postpone the Games by a year at most, the Sankei newspaper reported on Tuesday, adding that a poll showed about 70% of the Japanese think it is appropriate to delay the Olympics.Pound said a large number of stakeholders from the organizing committee, to athletes to broadcasters and sporting federations would all need to be consulted before a plan could be finalised but there were early signs of a willingness to accommodate a 2021 Summer Games.World Athletics said on Monday they would be willing to move their 2021 world championships scheduled for Aug. 6-15 in Eugene, Oregon to clear a path for a 2021 Olympics.“World Athletics has already been in discussion with the Oregon 21 Organising Committee regarding the possibility the Olympic Games may move to next year and they in turn have held discussions with their key stakeholders and have reassured us they will work with all of their partners and stakeholders to ensure that Oregon is able to host the World Athletics Championships on alternative dates should that prove necessary,�� athletics�� global governing body said in a statement.An Olympics postponement would be a blow for host country Japan, which has pumped in more than $12 billion of investment, and huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters.But a groundswell of concern from athletes - already struggling to train as gyms, stadiums and swimming pools close around the world - appeared to be tipping the balance, along with the cancellation of other major sports events.More than 350,000 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 15,000 have died in a pandemic that the World Health Organisation said was accelerating.The Olympics have never before been delayed, though they were canceled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the two world wars, and major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984 respectively.“The moment the IOC indicates that it is thinking about other solutions, it has already decided to delay the Games,�� said French Olympic Committee President Denis Masseglia.Canada and Australia both bluntly said they would not participate if the Games were not put back to 2021 and Britain may have followed suit.“We are in the midst of a global health crisis that is far more significant than sport,�� Canada’s Olympic Committee and Paralympic Committee said in a statement.A raft of other nations and sports bodies piled pressure on the IOC to make a quick decision.Athletes were sad but broadly supported a delay.“The right choice was made, but it doesn’t make it any easier,�� said Canadian world champion swimmer Maggie MacNeil, who was hoping to make her Olympic debut in Tokyo.“Sometimes you just need a good hug.”Japanese authorities seemed to be bowing to the inevitable, despite the losses and logistics headaches it would entail.“We may have no option but to consider postponing,�� Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending, told parliament.The organizing committee is already scaling back the torch relay to avoid crowds, national broadcaster NHK said.Japanese sponsors, from Toyota Motor Corp to Panasonic Corp, were watching nervously. But Tokyo stocks sensitive to the success of the Olympics surged on Monday, after sharp falls in prior weeks, thanks to expectations of a delay rather than a cancellation.Ad agency Dentsu Group’s shares jumped 12%.Pound told Reuters the IOC had tried to hold fire in order to be able to present the hosts, sports federations and sponsors with a clear alternative plan.“Probably what turned the tide in the last couple of days is the curve on the COVID-19 virus. It is getting very, very steep now and this is clearly not something that is going to be under control by June or July and probably not by the end of the year.��	9.297929793
TOKYO/DETROIT (Reuters) - Are electric cars running out of juice again?Recent moves by Japan’s two largest automakers suggest that the electric car, after more than 100 years of development and several brief revivals, still is not ready for prime time - and may never be.In the meantime, the attention of automotive executives in Asia, Europe and North America is beginning to swing toward an unusual but promising new alternate power source: hydrogen.The reality is that consumers continue to show little interest in electric vehicles, or EVs, which dominated U.S. streets in the first decade of the 20th century before being displaced by gasoline-powered cars.Despite the promise of “green�� transportation - and despite billions of dollars in investment, most recently by Nissan Motor Co - EVs continue to be plagued by many of the problems that eventually scuttled electrics in the 1910s and more recently in the 1990s. Those include high cost, short driving range and lack of charging stations.The public’s lack of appetite for battery-powered cars persuaded the Obama administration last week to back away from its aggressive goal to put 1 million electric cars on U.S. roads by 2015.The tepid response to EVs also pushed Nissan’s high-profile chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, perhaps the industry’s most outspoken proponent of battery cars, to announce in December a major strategic shift toward more mainstream gasoline-electric hybrids, which overcome many of the shortcomings of pure EVs.The move was widely seen as a tacit acknowledgement by Ghosn that his all-or-nothing, multibillion-dollar bet on EVs is falling far short of his ambition to sell hundreds of thousands of battery-powered Nissan Leafs.Instead, Nissan plans to follow rival Toyota Motor Co, the world’s largest purveyor of hybrids, which now is poised to leapfrog pure EVs altogether to pursue what might be the next big green-tech breakthrough: pollution- and petroleum-free fuel-cell cars that convert hydrogen to electricity.Vice Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, the “father of the Prius�� who helped put hybrids on the map, said he believes fuel-cell vehicles hold far more promise than battery electric cars.“Because of its shortcomings �� driving range, cost and recharging time �� the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars,�� said Uchiyamada. “We need something entirely new.”In the race to identify the Next Big Thing in automotive technology, the stakes are enormous.For example, Nissan, with French partner Renault, has committed $5 billion for development and manufacture of EVs and batteries �� a risky bet that could take years to pay off �� while Toyota has spent an estimated $10 billion or more over the past 16 years to develop, build and market an ever-expanding range of hybrids, led by the popular and now profitable Prius.While neither Nissan nor Toyota is likely to pull the plug on electric cars, it is clear from their recent moves that both companies are looking beyond EVs to meet future transportation needs.Both automakers began advanced green-car engineering programs in the mid-1990s, with Toyota introducing the first-generation Prius hybrid and Nissan unveiling the battery-powered Altra in late 1997.Toyota brought the Prius to the United States in 2000, but it took Nissan another 10 years to follow the low-volume Altra and other modest electric-car projects such as the Hypermini with the handsomely funded 2010 launch of the Leaf.With Uchiyamada overseeing continuous refinement of the Prius, Toyota took a 10-year lead in the green-car derby. Along the way, though, Toyota effectively subsidized billions of dollars in development, manufacturing and marketing costs through the first two generations of the Prius, according to former Toyota executives.While it took the Toyota hybrid six years to catch fire with U.S. consumers, the latest sales data points to the widening chasm between the two companies�� radically different approaches to electrification.In the past year, Toyota has broadened its hybrid portfolio to 12 models, including four versions of the Prius, now in its third generation. Toyota in 2012 sold 327,413 hybrids in the United States and 1.2 million globally. Worldwide sales of its hybrids now approach 5 million.The Prius accounts for more than half of those sales, making it the most successful green car in history and one of the few exceptions to the public’s yawning indifference to green vehicles and technology.The Leaf, on the other hand, has been the rule rather than the exception.Nissan unveiled the Leaf two years ago and to date has sold just under 50,000 worldwide. It sold 9,819 last year in the United States, well under its target of 20,000.As part of a year-end sales push, Nissan slapped incentives of almost $6,000 on the Leaf, and in January slashed the starting price by more than $6,000, to $29,650. Some Nissan dealers in Los Angeles are advertising Leaf lease rates as low as $199 a month with $1,999 down, according to industry research firm TrueCar.“When new technologies are launched, sales do not grow as quickly as everyone expects,�� said Mitsuhiko Yamashita, Nissan executive vice president and head of research and development. But “with EV technologies continuously improving and with prices falling, there is a possibility that sales could explode.”That isn’t likely to happen anytime soon.Nissan may be mildly encouraged that the Leaf is the best-selling pure EV in the United States. But total EV sales last year were only 14,687, representing 0.1 percent of total U.S. sales of 14.5 million. In comparison, hybrid sales in 2012 climbed to 473,083, or roughly 3.3 percent of the market. And of every three hybrids sold last year in the United States, two were a Toyota or a Lexus.Fueled by government subsidies and tax incentives, hybrid sales in Japan have rocketed to 40 percent of the industry total, with the Prius a top seller. Hybrids, however, have been far less popular with consumers in such major markets as Europe and China.“WE ARE PRAGMATIC PEOPLE”The outlook for pure electric vehicles is even more cloudy.At the moment, Ghosn’s heady 2009 prediction that electric vehicles would capture 10 percent of the global market by 2020 �� 6 million battery-powered cars a year or more �� doesn’t seem remotely within reach.Yet the gradual tightening of global fuel-efficiency standards from 2020 on is forcing automakers to assess their options, including the application of advanced technology.Says Nissan’s Yamashita: “It is not possible to meet (future) regulations unless vehicles are electrified.”The harsh reality of the market and the public’s underwhelming demand for EVs, however, illuminate Nissan’s recent decision to shift more of its green-tech investment into hybrids.In December the company announced it plans to introduce 15 new hybrids globally by early 2017.At the time, Ghosn said, “We are going to continue to heavily promote electric cars, but at the same time, we are business people, we are pragmatic people. We will also develop and deliver hybrids because there are markets and consumers that require hybrids.”Last September, Toyota publicly walked away from plans to build several thousand electric cars, scaling back projected volume to a mere 100 battery-powered minicars.Both Japanese automakers, meanwhile, have forged new alliances to develop hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars, Toyota with BMW and, in a deal announced last week, Nissan with Daimler AG and Ford Motor Co.In the meantime, despite massive investments in battery technology and vehicles, even the most ardent EV adherents seem a bit ambivalent about the future of battery cars.“We don’t regret it yet,�� says Nissan’s Yamashita of the company’s multibillion-dollar gamble on EVs. “We might in a few years. No, we probably won’t.��	6.766840437
(Removes reference to 2012 in paragraph 5, to make clear that entire paragraph refers to 2013 industry projections)* Industry on pace to turn in best year since 2007* Toyota, Honda gained market share in 2012* Toyota’s U.S. December sales up 9 pct, GM up 5 pct* Economic uncertainty in 2013 may dampen salesBy Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales rose 9 percent in December, led by foreign manufacturers, capping off the best year for the industry since before the recession.The year’s sales were driven by a slowly recovering economy, more available credit and the need for consumers and businesses to replace aging cars and trucks.General Motors Co posted December U.S. sales growth of 5 percent compared with the year-earlier month, Ford Motor Co increased sales 2 percent and Chrysler Group LLC’s sales rose 10 percent.Wall Street cheered the results, sending GM and Ford stock to their highest levels since July 2011.Research and consulting firm Polk said it expects U.S. auto sales to hit 15.3 million vehicles in 2013, an increase of nearly 7 percent. GM and Ford both predicted industry sales of more than 15 million vehicles, but Toyota Motor Corp offered a more modest forecast of 14.7 million vehicles.In the decade prior to 2008 when the recession slowed the industry, U.S. auto sales averaged nearly 17 million vehicles a year.While last month’s auto sales showed little impact of jitters caused by the so-called fiscal cliff - which proved largely averted - automakers expressed worry over the fog of remaining uncertainty emanating from Washington.The impact of a payroll tax increase that took effect at the start of the year and the upcoming congressional debate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling may keep some consumers out of the market in 2013, several automakers said.“It would have been nice if all the open questions had been resolved in the ‘fiscal cliff�� discussion over the holiday, but clearly they weren’t, and that does extend this period of uncertainty from a consumer point of view,�� Jonathan Browning, head of Volkswagen AG’s American unit, told reporters on a conference call.A 2 percentage-point payroll tax increase will take about $1,000 from the average household budget, said Ford economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick.“It is something that we’re looking at very carefully, as it will crimp the consumer spending scene somewhat in the months ahead,�� said Hughes-Cromwick.Jesse Toprak, analyst with TrueCar.com, said the hit to households would be about the same amount as a down payment on a new vehicle.“The cheap financing and improved income will make up for that, but that’s something we’re going to have a keep an eye on,�� he said.Hughes-Cromwick said the tax increases for the wealthiest Americans will not greatly affect auto sales, because they tend to purchase new vehicles even if taxes change.Tom Libby, an analyst at Polk, said continued low interest rates along with an improved housing sector and new product offerings from major automakers will make 2013 a bullish year for the industry.Detroit’s automakers showed December U.S. sales gains of 5 percent, slightly better than analysts�� expectations, but not enough to stave off market-share gains by Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd.The two largest Japanese automakers in the U.S. market rebounded from poor showings in 2011 when their inventory was constrained after the Japan earthquake and tsunami.Toyota reported a 9 percent U.S. sales increase for December, which met analysts�� expectations. Honda’s December sales rose 26 percent but fell short of analysts�� expectations. Honda sales are up 24 percent on the year.Toyota’s 2012 U.S. sales rose about 27 percent, compared with gains of 3.7 percent for GM, 4.7 percent for Ford, and 21 percent for Chrysler.Industrywide for the year, U.S. auto sales for 2012 rose 13.5 percent to nearly 14.5 million new vehicles, the best performance since 2007, according to Reuters calculations.GM’s market share is now at its lowest level since at least 1960, and probably at a low not seen since 1930, according to industry journal Ward’s Auto.GM and Ford lost market share in 2012, dented by competition from Toyota and Honda which recovered from 2011 earthquake-related setbacks.GM entered December with a 17.9 percent share of the U.S. market. While it is still the top automaker as measured in U.S. sales, its market share has fallen from 19.6 percent for 2011 and 23.5 percent in 2007.“We’re always concerned about market share - always,�� said Mark Reuss, GM chief in North America. “But we’re not going to give it away like we did in the past and burn the residuals and the brand values in anticipation of the biggest product portfolio launch that we’ve had in history.”Reuss referred to the years before GM’s 2009 bankruptcy and taxpayer bailout, when vehicle production outpaced demand and it layered on incentives to lower prices for consumers.The F-Series pickup truck from Ford, the top-selling vehicle in North America for more than three decades, had its best sales month in December since August 2007.The F-Series remained the best-selling vehicle in the United States, with annual sales of 645,316, followed again by the full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup, at 418,312.Most luxury brands had a good year. BMW for the second straight year edged German rival Mercedes-Benz for the U.S. sales crown, followed by Toyota’s Lexus and Honda’s Acura.The two U.S. luxury brands both saw sales fall in 2012, with Cadillac down 1.7 percent and Lincoln off 4.1 percent.Japanese models swept the next four places, with Toyota Camry leading Honda Accord, Honda Civic and Nissan Altima. Chrysler’s Ram pickup placed seventh, followed by Toyota Corolla, Ford Escape and Ford Focus.Both GM and Ford went into the recession that began in late 2007 - and into 2008 when gasoline prices spiked - overladen with low-mileage big pickup trucks and SUVs.Chrysler easily beat analysts�� expectations and had its 33rd consecutive month of year-on-year sales gains. Its annual sales rose 21 percent. Its market share at the end of November was 11.1 percent up from 10.6 percent in 2011. Chrysler is majority-owned by Italian automaker Fiat SpA.Sales for South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Corp and Kia Motors Co rose 5 percent. Hyundai, the larger of the sister companies, reported full-year U.S. sales of 703,007 vehicles, a company record.Volkswagen reported a monthly increase of 31.5 percent for its namesake brand and luxury brands Audi and Porsche and a 30 percent gain for the full year.December sales fell 12 percent for Lincoln, Ford’s luxury brand.Aided heavily by consumer incentives that reduce the price of the vehicles, GM in December dramatically trimmed its inventory of full-size pickup trucks to 80 days of supply from 139 days at the end of November. Most automakers like to have about 80 days of supply of these pickup trucks.For the overall industry, the pace of annual sales increases has been in the double digits since the market bottomed in 2009, when it hit the worst annual sales rate since World War Two, adjusting for population.Ford shares were up 2 percent at $13.46 and GM shares were up 2.2 percent at $29.77 late on Thursday.	0.5033901788
TOKYO (Reuters) - Torrential rain triggered floods and landslides in Japan on Wednesday, killing at least two people and prompting authorities to order more than 900,000 people to leave their homes while another million were advised to move to safety.More than twice the usual rainfall for the whole of August has fallen over parts of the southern island of Kyushu over the past 48 hours, washing away roads, causing rivers to burst their banks and forcing the suspension of train services.One man was killed when his car was swept away in Saga prefecture, while another man in Fukuoka prefecture died after being dragged away by flood waters when he got out of his stalled car, NHK national broadcaster said.A woman in Saga was found without signs of life - a term Japanese authorities use to describe people yet to be officially confirmed as dead - in her car after it fell into a waterway.“I woke up and the water was ankle-deep in my house, which has never happened before,�� one man in an evacuation center told NHK.“So I played it safe and evacuated early before things got any worse.”In one part of Saga, 427 mm (17 inches) of rain fell in the 48 hours up to 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday.Though authorities withdrew a warning of historically heavy rain by afternoon, it was expected to keep falling overnight, prompting additional warnings about flooding and landslides.More than 900,000 people were ordered to evacuate, NHK said, while Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency said just over a million others were advised to leave their homes.Television footage showed roads and railroad stations inundated and people wading knee-deep in flooded streets after several rivers broke their banks. Twitter users posted video of muddy brown torrents pouring through streets.“The first floor of our house is flooded and a total wreck, so we’re here on the second floor, awaiting rescue,�� one person posted on Twitter.“We can see the firemen out there moving around, but our street is such a mess they don’t seem to want to come in.”The Ground Self Defense Force - Japan’s military - said it had deployed about 100 troops for disaster relief after a request from Saga prefecture.Public transport and businesses were affected.Toyota Motor Corp said it would suspend work on Wednesday evening at a factory in Kyushu that builds Lexus cars, while Daihatsu Motor said it would stop work at its factories in the region.	4.597436488
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is developing a next-generation taxi for the Japanese market and it has formed a partnership with the country's hire-taxi federation to explore uses for new technology, the company said on Friday.The partnership comes as Japan’s biggest automaker invests heavily in automated driving, car sharing and other connected mobility technologies, while Japan’s powerful taxi industry has opposed efforts by ride-hailing app Uber [UBER.UL] to expand into the country.Toyota’s new taxi, which is being developed in cooperation with the Japan Federation of Hire-Taxi Associations, will focus on being accessible to the elderly, families with children and foreign tourists. It would become available in 2017, it said.The automaker said that it would collaborate with the association, which represents more than 15,000 taxi operators nationwide, to use taxis in Tokyo to collect and analyze information on road traffic, and apply the results to technologies including automated driving.Toyota produces the majority of the country’s taxis. It has said it plans to market a vehicle which can drive autonomously on highways by 2020.The tie-up is the latest in a series of new partnerships Toyota has inked in the past year, including with Uber, while the company has also set up a $1 billion artificial intelligence research institute.	4.061745429

JAKARTA (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N, the world's second-biggest car maker, is trying to break the Japanese stranglehold on the popular family car market in Indonesia, where it sees the next auto boom after China, a senior executive said.Despite being in Indonesia for about 30 years longer than Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and its affiliates including Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd 7262.T, the U.S. company is only a small player in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.The U.S. company sold around 12,000 cars from January to October this year, whereas Toyota, the world’s biggest car maker, sold more than 350,000.General Motors is banking on multi-purpose vehicles, sport utility vehicles and compact cars to close the gap with its Japanese rivals, said Michael Dunne, who became president of the company’s Indonesian operations in September.“The most exciting thing about Indonesia is it reminds me of China about a dozen years ago, early 2000s,�� Dunne, a former car consultant who was also the author of a book on General Motors�� strategy in China, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.“Population times per capita income equals opportunity for automakers. So when you have a massive population and you have that income threshold crossing $3,500, in country after country, without exception, that’s been a trigger of take-off.”Sales in Indonesia by some estimates are expected to double over the next three years.Since April this year, General Motors has been producing the Chevrolet Spin - a van with three rows of seats priced from 144 million rupiah ($12,000) - at its factory in the outskirts of Jakarta.The country of 240 million people has bought more than 1.1 million vehicles so far this year, according to the latest industry data from Gaikindo.Toyota and Daihatsu control more than half of that market and keep a tight grip on the local dealership network through their partnership with Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International ASII.JK.In response, General Motors, which is boosting its network of around 40 dealers in Indonesia, provides basic car maintenance and repairs directly to customers in their homes or offices.The company, with a slightly more than one percent share of the Indonesian market, is open to working with a partner in future, Dunne said.General Motors currently has a tie-up with SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS in China.“I think as a starting point, get in, get established, build a brand, win customers�� enthusiasm for our brand. (Then) take a look around and say, in this phase two as we look to the future, what makes more sense for us: remain independent, form an alliance?�� Dunne said.“Everything is under consideration, what makes sense for us to grow our business in this market,�� he said.General Motors is also closely watching the development of cheap, fuel-efficient cars in Indonesia. Automakers including Toyota and Honda Motor Co 7267.T have spent billions of dollars this year on a new line of low-cost, green car (LCGC) models.“It will be really interesting to see what happens with LCGCs,�� Dunne said. “We would like to watch first, let the incumbents lead, see where they take it. They may create a market that we can join.��($1 = 11,972 rupiah)	0.3905600798
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday forecast overall vehicle sales in Thailand to rise 12 percent this year from last, greater than the 3 percent it estimated in January, saying the auto market has benefited from favorable economic conditions.The Japanese automaker, which commands about one-third of the Thai vehicle market, also raised its local sales growth forecast to 31 percent from 25 percent.“New models and various marketing activities introduced by carmakers have also played a big role in stimulating the Thai auto market,�� Toyota Motor Thailand President Michinobu Sugata said a news conference.Thailand’s government expects rising investment, exports and tourism to push economic growth beyond that of 2017, which was the quickest rate in five years.The Southeast Asian country is a regional production and export hub for the world’s biggest automakers, and the auto sector accounts for about 12 percent of gross domestic product.In January-June, overall vehicles sales rose 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, with those of Toyota jumping 26 percent, Sugata said.“Market growth for the first half was beyond our expectation,�� he said. “In light of the upward trend in the auto market, we foresee a better market outlook.”Toyota now expects to sell 315,000 vehicles in Thailand this year, out of an overall 980,000. It maintained its export target of 300,000 vehicles, matching last year.Sugata also said import tariffs under consideration in the United States for vehicles and parts should have limited impact on Thai auto exports as under 10 percent go to that country.“But if other countries also introduce protectionist measures, there will definitely be an impact,�� Sugata said.In Southeast Asia, Toyota aims to sell 3.5 million vehicles this year, having sold 1.71 million in January-June. In 2017, it sold 3.36 million vehicles across the region, Sugata said.	-5.145128628
TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp forecast on Wednesday a 20 percent fall in operating profit this year as the world’s second largest automaker expects global vehicle sales to remain largely flat while it expects increased expenses from marketing activities.Toyota expects operating profit to come in at 1.6 trillion yen ($14.06 billion) in the year to March, below an average estimate of 2.3 trillion yen from 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and less than the 1.99 trillion yen profit posted in the year just ended.Toyota’s forecast is based on a projection that the yen will average around 105 yen to the U.S. dollar in the year through March, compared with 108 yen in the year just ended.The automaker also said it would buy back up to 1.65 percent of its own shares, worth 250 billion yen.

DETROIT, May 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Co, already locked in a public relations crisis because of a deadly ignition defect that has triggered the recall of 2.6 million vehicles, has a new perception problem on its hands.The U.S. company is now considered the worst big automaker to deal with, according to a new survey of top suppliers to the car industry in the United States.The annual survey, conducted by the automotive consultant group Planning Perspectives Inc, asks the industry’s biggest suppliers to rate their relationships with the six automakers that account for more than 85 percent of all light vehicle sales in the United States.Those so-called “Tier 1�� suppliers say GM is now their least favorite big customer, according to the rankings, less popular even than Chrysler, the unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , which since 2008 had consistently earned that dubious distinction.Suppliers gave GM low marks on all kinds of key measures, including its overall trustworthiness, its communication skills, and its protection of intellectual property.The suppliers also said that GM was the automaker least likely to allow them to raise prices to recoup unexpected material cost increases.“As a result, GM is now the least preferred customer of suppliers,�� PPI says.Nissan Motor Co Ltd overtook Ford Motor Co for third place in PPI’s Supplier Working Relations Index, pushing Dearborn-based Ford into fourth place. Toyota Motor Co and Honda Motor Co Ltd finished in the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, respectively.PPI, which has been conducting the survey for 14 years, says supplier perceptions of automakers are critical because they can determine which car makers see the suppliers�� newest technologies first, get their best pricing and work with their best engineers.John Henke, the head of PPI and a research fellow at Center for Supply Chain Management at Rutgers University, said the Japanese sweep of the top three places suggested the industry “could be entering an era in supplier relations that doesn’t bode well for the U.S. Big Three.”The reason: the Japanese automakers are not just benefiting from a deterioration in relations between suppliers and the Big Three -- they are actually rising in the estimation of their suppliers.Toyota and Nissan, in particular, saw the percentage of suppliers who characterized their relationship with the two automakers as “good or very good�� surge.GM, meanwhile, is in an especially unenviable spot, with 55 percent of the suppliers surveyed characterizing their relations with the automaker as “poor to very poor,�� up from 48 percent last year.One bit of good news for GM. When the list of car makers was expanded to include the three German auto companies, which have a far less significant market share in the U.S., suppliers said Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen AG were even harder to deal with.But because BMW ranked second in the expanded list, just below Toyota but ahead of Honda, GM’s overall position fell to seventh place in the supplier’s best/worst rankings.

TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor plan to roughly halve their production levels in China, the Nikkei reported on Monday, as a territorial row between the two countries cuts sales of Japanese cars in the world’s biggest auto market.Nissan will suspend the night shift at its passenger car factories in China and operate only during the day, the bussiness daily said. Nissan has two passenger car factories in China -- in Huadu and Zhengzhou -- with two lines each. A Nissan spokesman declined to confirm the report.Toyota and Honda plan to cut China production to about half normal levels by shortening working hours and slowing down the speed of production lines, the Nikkei reported without citing a source.

(Adds outlook for rebound, market share details)SAO PAULO, July 6 (Reuters) - Brazil’s car market shows signs of stabilizing after a brutal contraction, which drove sales to the lowest level in a decade during the first half of the year, the national automakers association said on Wednesday.Auto production fell just 3 percent in June from a year earlier, industry group Anfavea reported, compared to a 30 percent drop around the start of the year. Output rose 4 percent in June from May and sales increased nearly 3 percent.“It seems the market hit bottom, which is positive because that means we should see the start of a recovery around the end of the year, gathering strength beginning next year,�� Anfavea President Antonio Megale told journalists.That would end the worst crisis ever for Brazil’s beleaguered auto sector, which makes up about a fifth of national industrial output and has seen auto sales cut nearly in half compared to a 2012 peak, when Brazil was briefly the world’s fourth-largest market.Weak consumer confidence and towering interest rates still weigh on demand, however, and few economists expect a swift rebound from Brazil’s worst economic crisis in generations.Anfavea slashed 2016 forecasts last month to a 19 percent drop in auto sales and a 5.5 percent decline in output.All of the global carmakers in Brazil have been battered as a result of the economic crisis but those with the longest track record in the country -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, have been hit the hardest.Those four had a near deadlock on Brazil’s market before it opened in the 1990s and still accounted for three quarters of Brazilian car and light truck sales in 2010. But their combined market share has dropped to around 55 percent in the first six months of this year, while Asian competitors more than doubled their market share in four years to nearly 30 percent.Volkswagen’s market share has fallen the most since 2012, losing 8 percentage points and ceding second place in the market to General Motors.Ford has slipped from fourth place to sixth this year, overtaken by Toyota Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co , which arrived in Brazil less than a decade ago through a partnership with local manufacturer CAOA.Hyundai, Toyota and Honda Motor Co have more than doubled their market share in the past five years, as they opened new factories due to recent local content rules.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will make 2% fewer vehicles globally in August than originally planned, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday, as output recovers gradually from a steep drop because of the coronavirus pandemic.The company said it aimed to make 15,000 fewer vehicles than its initial plan, which was around 750,000, according to Reuters�� calculations. August’s reduction is smaller than the cut of 10% seen in July, and June’s 40% reduction.As Japan fears a second wave of infections spreading from the capital, one Toyota employee working at its headquarters has tested positive for coronavirus since developing symptoms earlier this month, the company said on Tuesday. Toyota added it disinfected the affected work sites on July 17 and restarted operation shortly afterwards.In the midst of the pandemic, the company also plans to skip media briefings for its fiscal first and third quarterly results, but only release filings, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.Global automakers are slowly getting vehicle production back on track after the closure this year of many plants to curb the spread of the virus, although many still anticipate that output and sales will be lower than last year.The updated production plan represents an output cut of 9% from a year ago.Toyota said it would produce 6,000 fewer vehicles at home, and 9,000 less overseas.	5.995564708
* Honda recalls close to another 4.9 mln vehicles* Daihatsu recalls nearly 260,000 of its cars* Takata shares close down 5.4 pct (Recasts, adds details, context)TOKYO, May 14 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co on Thursday recalled close to 5 million vehicles fitted with potentially faulty Takata Corp air bag inflators, as investigations showed the problem behind one of the biggest auto safety crises may be more widespread than thought.The latest move by Japan’s third largest automaker brings the overall global total of vehicles recalled for Takata-related air bags to around 36 million since 2008, and comes a day after Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co recalled 6.5 million vehicles worldwide.Daihatsu Motors Co Ltd said it recalled nearly 260,000 cars.Honda said it decided to recall the cars after finding some Takata bag inflators were not sealed properly, allowing moisture to seep into the propellent casing that could make the air bag explode with excessive force, shooting shrapnel inside the vehicle.Six deaths have been linked to defective air bags, all on cars made by Honda, which has borne the brunt of the Takata recalls to date, and which posted disappointing profit forecasts last month citing high quality-related costs.Automakers have been conducting their own investigations into Takata air bags.Most of Takata’s previous recalls were to replace air bags made at factories in the United States and Mexico where moisture got into the casing, the company and automakers have said.“While we are not able to determine the cause of the problems there is a possibility there will be more recalls,�� said Honda spokesman Teruhiko Tatebe.Honda, Toyota and Nissan said the recalls were precautionary, and there were no reports of accidents or injuries.Asked about the latest recalls, a Takata spokesman said the company would continue to cooperate with the automakers.Takata Chief Financial Officer Yoichiro Nomura told analysts on Thursday that the company, which has boosted production to supply replacement inflators, had “no plans for now�� to set aside more cash for the latest recalls, the spokesman added.Honda said it would use replacement parts supplied by Takata rivals Autoliv and Daicel Corp, as well as by Takata itself. It said the recall, which includes its Fit subcompact, did not affect any vehicles in the United States - where most of its previous recalls have been.The total Takata-linked recalls top the largest U.S. recall of 21 million vehicles by Ford Motor Co in the 1980s for a parking gear problem, according to U.S. safety regulators and safety advocates.Takata faces multiple class-action lawsuits in the United States and Canada, as well as a U.S. criminal investigation and regulatory probe.It has said it expects to return to profit this financial year even though it made few provisions for costs related to the recall.	-1.768756796

(New throughout with comments from union president, Toyota Canada, background)TORONTO, March 31 (Reuters) - Workers at Toyota Motor Corp’s Canadian plants are set to vote next week on whether to become the first at wholly owned Toyota facilities in North America to unionize, a push Canada’s biggest private-sector union is confident will succeed.A “yes�� vote would mark a major victory for the union, Unifor, which has more than 300,000 members, including more than 39,000 in the auto industry, even though previous attempts to organize Toyota’s Canadian plants failed.“There’s no question, there will be a lot of eyes on this drive,�� Unifor President Jerry Dias said at a press conference on Monday, where he was flanked by Toyota employees who said they wanted a bigger say in their workplace.Unifor, which filed for union certification at Toyota with the Ontario labor board on Monday, said it did not want to say exactly how many workers have signed union cards, citing strategy. It said, however, that of the 6,500 workers at the three Toyota assembly plants in Ontario, well over the 40 percent needed for a vote to be held have signed cards.The results of the vote, which is expected to start on Monday, will not be known until later in April, the union said. More than 50 percent of workers would have to vote “yes�� for a union to be formed.Toyota Motor Co of Canada, which has two plants in Cambridge, Ontario, and one plant in Woodstock, Ontario, said that its workers already “have a package that’s at, or near, the top of the industry�� and that it was uncertain what more a union could offer.“We don’t know what they’re going to be able to negotiate or, frankly, what they’re going negotiate away,�� said spokesman Greig Mordue. “What Unifor can offer is, frankly, a mystery.”He added that Toyota Canada, which began assembling vehicles in Ontario in 1988, has never laid off a permanent employee.Mordue said that that record stands despite such challenges as the recession, and a 50 percent drop in production for two months earlier this year due to supply chain disruptions.If a union is formed, collective bargaining would begin immediately, Dias said, and would address such key issues as wages, pensions, contract work, and health and safety standards.Negotiations would create a Toyota-specific contract, he added, and not be a “carbon copy�� of what was negotiated with the Detroit 3 in Canada in 2012. Unifor represents workers at the Canadian arms of General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.“The auto industry in Canada, and Ontario specifically, is a C$69 billion ($62.51 billion) a year industry and we want to protect it,�� Dias said. That means the union would not negotiate a contract at Toyota with labor costs that were out of line with other manufacturers, he added.Toyota workers are unhappy with temporary contracts, Unifor has said, which have reduced benefits and don’t allow participation in the company’s pension plan. About one-quarter of Toyota’s 6,500 workers are contract workers, Dias said.The pension plan is also an issue after the company said last year that it would put new permanent hires on a defined contribution plan, versus a more costly defined benefit plan.Unifor said part of its confidence in the Toyota campaign is a reflection of the movement’s home-grown roots. The first union cards from Toyota in 2012 were photocopies that workers had made on the back of company bulletins, Unifor said.The drive gathered speed with last September’s high-publicity formation of Unifor, a merger of the Canadian Auto Workers union and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers union, Unifor said.At its two plants in Cambridge, the company manufactures the Toyota Corolla, Toyota Matrix and Lexus RSX 350. The Toyota Rav4 is made at a newer plant in Woodstock.Toyota, which says its staffing is significantly higher than the 6,500 estimated by Unifor, can assemble more than 500,000 vehicles annually at its Canadian plants.In 2008, the International Association of Machinists withdrew a bid to try to unionize the Canadian Toyota plants due to inadequate support. That followed a similar withdrawal by the Canadian Auto Workers in 2001.Unifor’s push comes after the high-profile failure of the United Auto Workers to unionize workers at a Chattanooga, Tennessee, Volkswagen plant.Currently, the UAW represents just one foreign-owned U.S. factory, a Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, with around 1,000 workers. Overall UAW membership increased in 2013, however.Unifor said that 90 percent of Toyota plants worldwide are unionized. Toyota previously had a joint-venture auto manufacturing plant in California with GM that was unionized, but it shut in 2010. The plant is now owned by Tesla Motors Inc .	-3.082494259
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday said it has invested in U.S. car-sharing company Getaround, a move that comes as global automakers seek to shore up their presence in new technology sectors amid growing competition from transport startups.The world’s biggest-selling automaker confirmed in an email to Reuters that it has invested in the San Francisco-based start-up through its investment fund, Mirai Creation Investment Limited Partnership, but declined to offer further details.Earlier on Friday, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported that Getaround was believed to have received around $10 million from the fund.Established last year, the fund which also includes Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) as an investor, also invests in artificial intelligence and robotics.Getaround has been operating its on-demand car-sharing service in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington D.C., and other U.S. cities since 2013. It claims to have more than 200,000 members.Automakers have been scrambling to partner with tech firms to head off competition from self-driving cars and car sharing services that threaten to eventually trim demand for car ownership.Toyota’s investment follows similar moves this year by other automakers who have partnered with car sharing service providers, including General Motors Co and Lyft Inc, and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Israel’s Gett.Toyota already has a partnership with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], through which the automaker leases vehicles to Uber drivers, and plans to work with the ride-hailing service to accelerate mobile technology research.	1.720560263
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor 7203.T has no intention of offering ultra-cheap cars to boost sales in emerging markets and will keep its focus on customers who expect a certain level of reliability, the company's president, Akio Toyoda, said on Thursday.Toyoda's comments come days after rival Nissan Motor 7201.T announced the revival of the Datsun brand to target buyers in the lowest and sizeable end of developing markets, while a German magazine reported Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE was also planning a similar move.“We are a full-line car maker,�� Toyoda told a small group of reporters in Tokyo.""But to grow sustainably, we need to make a certain level of profit on cars, no matter how big or small they are.

TAMO.NS I don't think so,"" he said, referring to the Indian automaker famed for developing the world's cheapest car, the Nano, whose sales have fallen short of targets.“When we think about what customers value in our cars, it’s reliability,�� Toyoda said, adding that was evident in the popularity of used Toyota cars in many Asian countries.“We won’t risk sacrificing quality simply to meet a certain price range.”As demand becomes saturated in the developed world, global automakers are eyeing low-cost cars to drive sales growth, especially among first-time buyers moving up from motorcycles and used cars in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.Toyota has taken small steps to target that base, starting with the made-for-India Etios model. But analysts have said the starting price, of just under 400,000 rupees ($7,800) for the lowest-grade hatchback version, was still too high to challenge cut-price stalwarts such as Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS.BEING “NUMBER ONE”Nissan, meanwhile, is counting on Datsun to tap a price range uncharted by global automakers as it aims to join Toyota, General Motors GM.N and Volkswagen at the top of the sales charts with French partner Renault RENA.PA.In contrast, Toyoda said he wanted Toyota to put its energy into developing products for the middle- to upper-class where its strengths lie, even if that meant playing in only a fraction of big, emerging markets.“China has 1.4 billion people, but we don’t have to target all 1.4 billion,�� he said. “We’ll target perhaps 200 or 300 million of that - but that’s about the size of the whole U.S. market. It’s huge.”While GM and Volkswagen fight it out for sales dominance in China and the rest of the world, Toyoda said he wanted Toyota to strive for industry leadership in other ways, much like GM did by developing the industry as the biggest car maker over more than 70 years.“Until we overtook them (in 2008), GM was number one, uninterrupted since the 1930s. During that time, it helped the industry develop and created a culture of cars. That’s the kind of company that deserves to be the industry leader,�� he said.“Going forward, I think there will be a lot of shuffling around among the top five or seven. But for the crown to really mean anything, I don’t want to use it as a motivational tool,�� he said, repeating his warning that unchecked sales growth had played a role in Toyota’s quality crisis a few years ago.Toyota fell to third place in global vehicles sales behind GM and Volkswagen last year, hit by the disruption that followed the earthquake and tsunami disaster.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Car parts maker Delphi Automotive Plc DLPH.N won EU regulatory clearance on Friday to buy FCI Group's motorized vehicles unit (FCI MVL) for about $972 million from private equity firm Bain Capital.The European Commission said its investigation found no competition concerns because the purchase would not change the structure of the market.“The Commission’s investigation found that they have a moderate combined market share and a number of credible competitors remain active in this market,�� the EU executive said in a statement.The acquisition of FCI MVL, which makes connectors that link different parts of an airbag, will add Asian car makers Nissan Motor Corp 7201.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS to Delphi's customer base.Its other clients include Ford Motor F.N, General Motors GM.N, Volkswagen Group and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.	8.109182457
TOKYO (Reuters) - Miniature remote controlled cars have proved to be a crowd pleaser at track and field throwing events, but for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Toyota Motor Corp is upping the game with a hi-tech way to fetch javelins and hammers: pint-sized, self-driving A.I. robot cars.The Japanese automaker on Monday unveiled a prototype of its next-generation field support robot, a miniature shuttle bus-shaped contraption based on its “e-Palette�� ride-sharing vehicle under development, to be used at the Tokyo Games.The vehicle, roughly the size of a toddler’s ride-on toy car, can travel at a maximum speed of 20 kilometers per hour and sports three cameras and one lidar sensor which enable it to “see�� its surroundings.Draped around the top of its body is a band of LED lights which illuminate when the vehicle uses artificial intelligence to follow event officials toward the equipment hurled by athletes onto the pitch during shot put, discus throw, hammer throw and javelin events.After the equipment, which can weigh as much as eight kilograms for hammers, is loaded into the vehicle by the official, a press of a button located toward its front sends the car zipping back to athletes for later use.“Humans are better suited to picking up heavy equipment from the field, but for quickly transporting them to their respective return depots, that’s a job that’s best performed by robots,�� Takeshi Kuwabara, a project planning manager who oversaw the robot’s development, told reporters.“Our aim was to leverage the strengths of both humans and robots.”The trend of using miniature cars to fetch equipment at Olympics throwing events goes back to the 2008 Beijing Games, where firey-red, rocket-shaped cars scurried along the green to collect hammers, javelins and discuses.At the 2012 Games in London, BMW developed and operated a fleet of blue and orange miniature Mini Coopers to collect the discarded equipment, while pint-sized green pick-up trucks performed the task at the Rio games in 2016.A major sponsor of the Tokyo Games, Toyota also plans to dispatch virtual reality enabled humanoid robots and mobile telepresence robots which will enable spectators who cannot attend the games in person to experience events and meet athletes remotely.A fleet of robots on wheels developed by the automaker which can perform household tasks for elderly people and hospital patients will also guide guests to wheelchair seats and serve refreshments at events.Toyota plans to use the games to showcase its new vehicle technologies ranging from fuel-cell buses to on-demand, self-driving taxis, as it competes with industry rivals and tech firms to develop affordable autonomous cars and electric vehicles (EVs), along with on-demand transportation services.	-0.9608052463
LONG POND, Pa. - In his last start of the season, Kyle Busch got the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series victory he coveted most.Holding off a charge from Kyle Busch Motorsports teammate Erik Jones - who started the race in place of ailing Noah Gragson - Busch, the pole winner, powered his No. 51 Toyota across the finish line 1.469 seconds ahead of Jones�� No. 18 to win the Gander Outdoors 150 at Pocono Raceway.The number ��51�� had added significance on Saturday. In winning for the second time in five starts this season and the second time at the 2.5-mile “Tricky Triangle,�� Busch collected the 51st NCWTS victory of his career, tying him for the all-time series lead with NASCAR Hall of Fame member Ron Hornaday Jr.Busch’s milestone triumph, however, was in doubt until the closing laps. On Lap 52 of 60, Jones caught Busch in heavy race traffic and pulled ahead as the trucks rounded Turn 1 and headed down the Long Pond straightaway.But Busch regained the lead through the Tunnel Turn, powering to the outside of Jones, whose Tundra was slowed by a lapped truck. From that point, Busch pulled away for the victory.“They (Jones) had a better truck,�� Busch acknowledged. “I tried and tried to work on this thing to make it better and probably made it slower with all the things I changed on it, rather than making it faster.“I knew Erik was going to be fast in that truck - I knew Noah was going to be fast in that truck. They were the ones that we had to beat. I wish we were a tick faster, but obviously, being a bit slower, we put on a better show. Erik was able to run me down, and I did everything I could to hold him off.”When Busch did his celebratory burnout on the front stretch, two patches of rubber deposited on the racing surface caught fire.“I sat in one spot for too long on the asphalt,�� Busch said. “My bad.”Busch grabbed the lead from eventual third-place finisher Dalton Sargeant on Lap 37, with Jones running third at the time. It took Jones four more laps to get past Sargeant, as Busch opened a lead of more than two seconds.But Jones, who won the 2015 series championship in a KBM truck, ate into the gap steadily and had his one shot at the win on Lap 52.“I saw the lapped trucks, and they gave me the opportunity to get there,�� said Jones, who started from the rear of the field. “I was like, ‘This is going to be my shot, probably my only shot to get the lead, and if we can get the lead, I think we can hold him off.’�We came within about six inches of doing it, and I had to kind of check up. There were four lapped trucks. We passed three of them on the straightaway, and there was one more in the Tunnel Turn, and I had to check up on the bottom or run him over, which I wasn’t going to do.“Kyle was still at my quarter, and I had to give him space. It was a close moment. That was our one shot. I used up a lot of the truck just to make that one move.”Stewart Friesen finished fourth, followed by Justin Haley. Grant Enfinger, Todd Gilliland, Johnny Sauter, Matt Crafton and Joe Nemechek to complete the top 10.Gragson was suffering from a stomach virus and wasn’t cleared medically to compete after a visit to the infield care center. But Gragson will receive a medical waiver from NASCAR that keeps him eligible to compete for the series championship.With one victory to his credit this season, Gragson held on to second in the standings, 65 points behind Sauter.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race - Gander Outdoors 150Pocono RacewayLong Pond, PennsylvaniaSaturday, July 28, 20181.

* Carmakers to co-operate on hybrids, carbon fibre -sources* BMW needs hybrids, electric cars to meet EU targets* Toyota becomes more important to BMW as PSA ties fadeMUNICH/HAMBURG, June 27 (Reuters) - BMW and Toyota plan to expand a technological partnership, two sources close to the companies told Reuters, a deal that could prompt a shift in auto industry allegiances.The agreement will be extended to include hybrid powertrains and lightweight design, the sources said on Wednesday.However, BMW has not agreed a deal to tap General Motors�� advanced hydrogen fuel cell technology, a spokesman for the German luxury carmaker said.BMW has primarily preferred France’s PSA Peugeot Citroen as a partner when it comes to reducing development and production costs.But the cash-strapped French have recently sought savings through an alliance with GM. By aligning more with Toyota, BMW would have a partner that offers greater scale than Peugeot and a financially healthy one at that.BMW will host a news conference at 1030 GMT on Friday to mark a visit from Toyota scion and chief executive Akio Toyoda to the German carmaker’s Munich headquarters.The companies declined to comment on the conference’s subject matter, but the sources said Toyoda and BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer would explain their new ideas. The sources added, however, no contracts have been drafted for them to sign.Eager to bulk up its diesel engine line-up in a sagging European market, Toyota agreed to collaborate with BMW on lithium-ion battery research in exchange for a steady supply of BMW-made diesel engines starting in 2014.This time BMW looks to be the partner in need. Now that Peugeot is devoting resources to cementing an alliance with GM, the joint venture with the French firm on hybrid parts looks shaky.Additionally, BMW, whose hydrogen concept of burning the gas in an internal combustion engine never took off, has failed to reach an agreement to access GM’s technology in this area.“We are still in talks with GM, but no longer about this issue,�� a spokesman said on Wednesday, confirming a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt.A successful partnership with the Detroit-based automaker could have helped build trust with the new large shareholder of PSA.BMW needs to reduce the carbon emissions of its new car fleet by roughly a third, to 101 grams per kilometre, by 2020, which Reithofer argues can only be achieved if it ramps up the number of hybrid and electric cars in its range.“I would bet that there will soon be BMW cars equipped with Toyota’s hybrid powertrains,�� one of the sources said.The Japanese carmaker could then gain access to the carbon fibre joint venture with SGL, which produces cutting-edge lightweight materials that BMW aims to use on an industrial scale to mass produce its Megacity electric car, dubbed the i3.	-3.293182983

* Nikkei briefly touches 23,000 level* Auto-parts makers soarTOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei surged to 11-week highs on Tuesday morning after a trade agreement reached between the United States and Mexico lifted investor risk sentiment and triggered buying in automakers.The Nikkei share average rose 0.6 percent to 22,944.77 at the midday break, after briefly touching the 23,000 level.The United States and Mexico agreed on Monday to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), putting pressure on Canada to agree to new terms on auto trade and dispute settlement rules to remain part of the three-nation pact.“Investors are relieved on receding trade worries but there are several other factors in the U.S. that are raising sentiment for the Japanese market,�� said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.“The U.S. economy is strong, its corporate earnings are bright while inflation is under control, so the environment is favourable for risky asset investors.”He said one concern is that trading volume and turnover have been thin in the Japanese market, even though hedge funds are seen buying back Japanese stocks that they sold a few weeks ago.“Unless trade becomes more active, the Nikkei is unlikely to rise and stay above 23,000,�� Fujito said.Shares in Japan’s top three automakers, which have plants in Mexico, surged on Tuesday. Toyota Motor Co advanced 1.9 percent, Nissan Motor Co soared 2.2 percent and Honda Motor Co rose 2.3 percent.Autoparts makers followed suit, with Denso Corp up 3.3 percent, Aisin Seiki gaining 2.4 percent, and Jtekt Corp rising 2.5 percent.Investors also took heart from news that the Toyota group of companies said they would form a joint venture to develop software that manages brakes, steering and other components for automated driving.The broader Topix gained 0.7 percent to 1,740.36.

DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The top five automakers in the United States on Tuesday reported higher March sales, beating forecasts and raising expectations April could show an even stronger sales rebound after a long winter.Sales rose 5.7 percent in March to an annualized selling rate of 16.4 million vehicles, well beyond the expectations of 40 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. They on average expected a 2 percent increase for an annualized selling rate of 15.8 million vehicles.Cold weather and snow kept many consumers away from dealer show-rooms in early March. But the second half of the month showed promise that April will be a strong sales month, said sales executives from Ford and Toyota.Ford Vice President of U.S. Sales John Felice said the sales momentum in late March shows “the trend positive heading into April.”Bill Fay, general manager for Toyota brand U.S. sales, said,“We’re optimistic that momentum will spring us in into April.”General Motors Co GM.N U.S. sales rose 4 percent, Ford Motor Co F.N reported a 3 percent rise in U.S. sales, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T a 5 percent rise and Chrysler Group, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FIA.MI, a 13 percent increase from a year ago.All beat expectations by industry research firm Edmunds.com.No. 5 in the U.S. market for March, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, also came in ahead of estimates, selling 149,136 vehicles in the month, up 8 percent.GM’s 4 percent sales gain beat estimates of a 0.5 percent rise. But most of the attention on GM on Tuesday was focused on Chief Executive Mary Barra’s appearance at a congressional hearing on the company’s slow response to defective ignition switches, blamed for at least 13 deaths.Alec Gutierrez, analyst with industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, said it was too early to tell if GM’s recall crisis has hurt its sales, but said that it is possible that buyers may stray to other automakers soon.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see some conquest activity maybe in April or May,�� said Gutierrez.GM shares closed down 0.2 percent at $34.34, after trading higher earlier in the day. Ford shares added 4.6 percent to $16.32. The wider S&amp;P 500 index was up 0.7 percent.Auto sales are an early indicator of U.S. consumer demand for big-ticket items that comes right at the start of a new month, before government reports on retail sales and durable goods. The economy sagged in the first two months of year, as did auto sales, amid massive snowstorms over much of the United States. But there were signs of a pickup since then.The boost in sales may be linked to higher incentives by automakers in March, said Larry Dominique, executive vice president at industry researcher TrueCar. He said incentives rose 8 percent to an average $2,800 per new vehicle sale.Automakers and dealers offer incentives, ranging from discounts to low interest rates, to entice consumers to buy.Honda Motor Co 7267.T showed a decline in U.S. March sales of 2 percent, to 133,318 vehicles. Although Honda's sales fell, many analysts had forecast a deeper drop, including Edmunds, which saw a 10 percent decrease.GM’s full-size pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra saw sales of 53,378, up 11 percent. Its Buick brand sales rose 13 percent and its Cadillac brand fell 6 percent.Ford said its F-Series pickup truck sales rose 5 percent to about 71,000 in March and its Fusion sedan sales rose 9 percent to nearly 33,000. Ford’s luxury brand, Lincoln, increased sales 31 percent, led by a 72 percent sales jump for its best-selling vehicle, the MKZ sedan.Toyota’s top-selling sedan, the Camry, increased sales 11 percent to 41,953 in the month, and Toyota’s eight crossovers and SUVs increased sales 19 percent. Sales of Toyota’s smaller cars fell, including a drop of 16 percent for its hybrid Prius, 5.5 percent for Corolla and 24 percent for the Yaris subcompact.Chrysler relied on hefty sales of its Ram trucks and Jeep Cherokee SUV, which both showed 26 percent sales jumps from a year ago.Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS U.S. sales fell 2 percent in March to 67,005 vehicles. Its sister company Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS increased U.S. sales 11.5 percent to 54,777 vehicles.BMW BMWG.DE said its March sales rose 8 percent to 35,762 vehicles, despite a drop of 40 percent for its MINI brand. The BMW brand had a 19 percent sales rise to 32,107 vehicles.Subaru, a division of Fuji Heavy Industries 7270.T, said its March sales rose 21 percent to 36,701, led by a 53 percent rise for its best-selling vehicle in the U.S. market, the Forester crossover vehicle.Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE U.S. auto sales fell 3 percent to 36,717 vehicles in March.

Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. consumers buyers are taking out bigger car loans with longer pay-back periods as lenders offer lower interest rates and accept borrowers with weaker credit ratings, a report released on Wednesday showed.The average loan on a new car climbed to $26,719 in the third quarter, up by $756 from a year earlier, and the most in at least five years, according to data collected by Experian Plc .Despite borrowing so much more, average monthly payments on new car loans rose only $6 to $458. That is because banks and finance companies were willing to lend at lower rates and grant borrowers more time to repay.The average interest rate fell to 4.27 percent from 4.53 percent a year earlier and the average loan term stretched one more month to five years and five months, according to Experian.“The third quarter of 2013 proved to be a good time to purchase a new vehicle, particularly for consumers who buy based on their monthly payments,�� Melinda Zabritski, senior director of automotive credit for Experian Automotive, said in a statement from the data and analytical firm. “Shoppers perceive they are getting better deals and manufacturers and dealers are boosting sales,�� she said.Major automakers reported their best U.S. sales month in 6-1/2 years in November as the industry’s annual U.S. sales pace reached 16.41 million vehicles, the best showing since February 2007, according to industry research firm Autodata. That handily beat expectations for a rate of 15.75 million.The Experian report suggests that easier credit contributed to the sales increase, as did discounts by manufacturers and the popularity of big pickup trucks.Leasing has also increased and accounted for 27.2 percent of all new financing in the quarter, up from 24.4 percent a year ago and 14.2 percent in 2009.The Toyota Financial Services unit of Toyota Motor Corp had the biggest share of new leases, with 15.2 percent, according to Experian. Well Fargo &amp; Co made the most loans, with 5.4 percent of the total.Lenders made 26.04 percent of their loans on new cars to buyers with subprime credit scores, up from 24.84 percent a year earlier, said Experian, which collects car title and financing information to compile its reports. For loans on used cars, the portion to subprime borrowers rose to 54.95 percent from 54.43 percent.As the lenders made bigger loans, they also extended credit further beyond the value of the vehicles. The average loan-to-value on new cars rose to 110.6 percent, up by 1.17 percentage points. On used cars it rose to 133.2 percent, up by 2.18 percentage points.Auto lenders often provide loans that exceed the value of cars they are financing because borrowers want cash to pay sales taxes and fees.Extra-long loans are becoming more common. Some 19 percent of new car loans were made for more than six years, up from 16.4 percent a year earlier.For lenders, car loans performed much better in the last recession than had been expected. Some lenders have said that strapped consumers were more determined to keep up their car payments than their house payments because they needed vehicles to get to work or look for jobs.That experience has encouraged lenders to be more lenient with people borrowing for cars. So far, the tactic has largely worked. The percentage of loans 30-days delinquent was down in the third quarter to 2.58 percent from 2.67 percent a year earlier, Experian said.However, the average loss on loans gone bad jumped to $7,770 in the third quarter from $7,026 a year earlier and repossessions increased sharply, particularly for subprime borrowers.	-1.175986842
TOKYO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese electric car maker BYD Co Ltd and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday they planned to set up a joint venture to design and develop battery electric cars as they ramp up efforts to produce zero emissions vehicles.The two companies said in a statement that they would each invest 50% of the capital needed to establish the company, which will be set up next year and be based in China. The companies did not disclose the value of the venture.Widely considered a late comer in embracing battery EVs, compared with rivals including Nissan, Toyota had flagged in June that it aimed to get half of its global sales from EVs, including gasoline hybrids, by 2025, five years ahead of schedule.The venture aims to develop vehicles that run solely on batteries, rather than plug-in hybrid or gasoline-electric vehicles which also have a combustion engine.In July, the companies said they would develop battery-electric sedans and sport utility vehicles, which would then be sold under the Toyota brand in China before 2025.Toyota also develops hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and plans to launch fuel-cell car models with its Chinese partners, Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) and FAW Group, in China, as the world’s largest auto market increases support for fuel-cell vehicles.Shenzhen-based BYD, backed by Warren Buffett, whose models include the Song series and the Qin plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, aims to move to completely electric-powered vehicles. However, its profits are expected to drop this year as China cuts subsidies on EV.(This story fixes spelling in final paragraph)	-1.731421844

(Reuters) - Elfyn Evans opened his account with Toyota by taking a dominant win in Rally Sweden on Sunday to lead the world championship for the first time.The Welshman, who led from the opening stage of a winter event shortened due to a lack of snow and unusually mild conditions, beat reigning world champion Ott Tanak by 12.7 seconds.The victory was the second of Evans’s WRC career, and made him the first Briton to triumph in the Swedish round of the championship.Second place provided a first podium for 2019 winner Tanak since the Estonian, who had a big crash in the Monte Carlo opener last month, switched from Toyota to Hyundai at the end of last year.Evans’s only other win was at home in Wales Rally GB in 2017, with M-Sport Ford, the team he left at the end of last season for Toyota.Young Finn Kalle Rovanpera took third place for Toyota, ahead of six-times world champion team mate Sebastien Ogier, after winning the final power stage to collect five bonus points.“It was a tricky stage to finish and with the grip changing so much I didn’t take any chances. I felt it was a bit too much on the edge to take big chances,�� Evans told the official wrc.com website.“It’s been a big effort trying to settle into a new team and these guys have made the job very, very easy and given us everything we possibly could have wanted to do this.”After two races of the 13-round championship, Evans and Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville are tied on 42 points with Evans leading on a countback. Ogier has 37.Neuville, who claimed four bonus points from the power stage, was sixth in Sweden while Evans finished third in the Monte Carlo round won by the Belgian.Toyota lead the manufacturers�� standings with 73 points to Hyundai’s 63.Mexico is the next round of the world championship, on gravel roads around the central city of Leon on March 12-15.	-16.72406371
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O cloud computing unit will help Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T build a platform to help manage and monetize data gathered from the automaker's global vehicle fleet, the companies said on Monday.Toyota said its Mobility Services Platform will enable it to process and analyze data that can be used to develop vehicle services from ride and car sharing to behavior-based insurance and maintenance notifications.The deal is an expansion of Amazon Web Services�� existing collaboration with Toyota, and marks the e-commerce giant’s expanding foray into the transportation business.In July, AWS announced it was expanding a partnership with Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE to help develop the automaker's cloud-based software and data portal into an industry-wide marketplace where business customers can buy and sell industrial applications.In the automotive sector, AWS previously has partnered with automotive suppliers such as Aptiv, Panasonic Corp and Nvidia Corp, big transportation providers such as Uber and Avis, and self-driving heavy truck startups Embark and China’s TuSimple.	-0.7936507937
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp's 7261.T Mexican arm is recalling around 2,800 cars to check for possible defects in Takata air bags, the company said, the second such recall by an automaker in Mexico in as many weeks. Mazda will be contacting owners of the Mazda6 sold between 2006 and 2008 in Mexico for a voluntary review, the company said in a statement emailed late on Wednesday. The recall includes approximately 2,816 cars.Nissan, Honda, BMW and Toyota have also announced recalls in Mexico for a combined total of 159,485 cars to check Takata air bags, according to figures published on the website of Mexico’s consumer protection agency, Profeco.Around 21 million vehicles have been recalled worldwide since 2008 because of defective Takata inflators, which have been linked to five deaths.	1.692780096
(Adds details)* Jump comes despite stricter downpayment rules* Sales surge on growing middle class, low interest rates* Competition heating up with new Toyota, Daihatsu modelsBy Rieka RahadianaJAKARTA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Indonesian auto sales surged 25 percent to a record in 2012 and look set to keep growing strongly this year as sharply rising wages and low interest rates encourage more consumers to swap two wheels for four.The jump in annual sales to 1.1 million vehicles comes despite more stringent downpayment requirements. In December alone sales climbed 11.4 percent from a year earlier.A key indicator of domestic consumer spending, auto sales have been emblematic of a sterling year for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, although weakness in global demand for commodities has recently taken some shine off the country’s economic performance.Automakers, however, are developing more affordable cars for the domestic market with the latest offerings from Toyota Motor Corp and Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd priced under $10,000 to compete with models from Nissan Motor Co and Tata Motors Ltd. Expectations are high for continued robust sales.Bahana Securities estimates 18 percent growth in 2013 and 2014 though others say the pace of growth this year could slow due to regulatory efforts.“There is downside risk from regulation noise as Jakarta’s provincial government is keen to tackle congestion,�� said Adrian Joezer, an auto analyst at Mandiri Sekuritas, who predicts 10 percent growth this year.The Indonesia Automotive Industry Association has forecast 2013 sales at 1.1 million vehicles.“There are still impediments in 2013 which, according to our consideration, it will cause sales obstacles, such as government downpayment regulations and low commodity export prices,�� Sudirman Maman Rusdi, chairman of the association told Reuters.Industry leader Toyota led sales with 406,026 vehicles sold in 2012, accounting for a 36 percent market share.The shift to autos has hit sales of motorbikes, which fell 12 percent last year to 7 million.	6.914172489
(Reuters) - Spaniard Dani Sordo won the Rally of Italy in Sardinia for Hyundai on Sunday after Toyota’s overnight leader Ott Tanak suffered a steering problem on the final stage and slumped to fifth.Tanak, who still took over the championship lead from Citroen’s Sebastien Ogier, had been 26.7 seconds clear and heading for his third win in a row going into the final Sassari-Argentiera 2 power stage.The Estonian, who won all six stages on Saturday’s second leg, then spun and lost two minutes in the late drama.Finland’s Teemu Suninen finished second for M-Sport Ford, 13.7 seconds behind, with Norwegian Andreas Mikkelsen third for Hyundai and claiming five bonus points from the power stage.The win was Sordo’s first since 2013 and second of his career.Six-times world champion Ogier hit a rock and retired on Friday but returned to limit the damage by taking four bonus points in the power stage.Tanak is now four points clear of Ogier in the championship.	4.179753564
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T slashed its annual profit and global sales outlook to a four-year low, citing a firmer yen and bleak business in both India and its main market of North America, even as it unveiled plans to buy back $915 million shares.The dour outlook comes at a time when Honda is struggling to shore up its automobile operations, with its profitability down more than half in the past two years due to a series of quality-related issues constraining its financial firepower to invest in new vehicle technologies.Japan’s third-largest automaker now expects an operating income of 690 billion yen for the year to March, lowest since the year-ended March 2016, from 770 billion yen previously.It sees the yen averaging 107 versus the dollar over the period, from a previous assumption of 110 yen. A stronger currency eats into profits because exports become more expensive and the value of overseas earnings decreases.Honda said it had also been hit by an almost 20% slide in motorcycle sales over the six months to September in India. The world’s No.4 auto market has gone into a tailspin this year amid tight liquidity, high taxes and a weak rural economy.“The Indian market is contracting at a very rapid rate,�� said Honda Executive Vice President Seiji Kuraishi.“I must say, we are struggling there.”While Honda’s vehicle sales were overall flat in its main market of North America in the first half, it expects a “moderate�� decline over the course of the fiscal year.The company cut its outlook for global group auto sales to 4,975,000 vehicles, versus a previous forecast of 5,110,000, for the current financial year.For a graphic on Honda's operating profit, vehicle sales, please see : tmsnrt.rs/2p2j3AoHonda joins compatriots Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T, Subaru Corp 7270.T, Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T in slashing profit projections in recent days.Toyota bucked the trend and retained its forecast on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O posted its second quarterly profit in a row as vehicle deliveries hit a record and the company said it would comfortably make more than half a million units this year, pushing its shares to new highs.The delivery forecast, higher by more than a third than last year’s production, suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between chief executive Elon Musk and U.S. regulators.The electric carmaker’s stock, which has nearly doubled in the past year, jumped 13% after hours on Wednesday, cracking the $600 mark for the first time.Tesla said that the manufacturing process at its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China.The $2 billion Shanghai factory is key to Tesla’s growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later increase output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y.But the company warned of a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars because China ordered a shutdown of the factory after a new coronavirus breakout that has killed 170 people and infected thousands.“This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages,�� Tesla’s chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on a post-earnings call.The company is evaluating whether it will be hurt by the virus and whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California plant will be affected, he said.Tesla said it started production of the new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y at the Fremont factory this month and plans to deliver the first cars by the end of March, ahead of schedule.Tesla already starting Model Y production was the most notable item in the release, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note.“For a company that has always been late, this is a big improvement,�� he said.Tesla initially did not expect to make the Model Y until late 2020 and then moved up the forecast to this summer, finally beating that deadline by several months.The results indicate that Tesla is controlling costs better, a metric that investors have questioned Musk on before and that he was quick to talk about on the call.“In 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y production,�� he said.Tesla’s cash balance increased to $6.3 billion and total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion in the December quarter.And while its revenue per unit delivered rose by only 3% in the fourth quarter, operating profits per vehicle rose by roughly 19%.(Graphic: )Tesla, which last week overtook Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE as the second-most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, still trails luxury carmaker rivals on steady profits per vehicle, a key metric. (Graphic: )Some analysts have questioned the more than $104 billion valuation, but investors are betting that Tesla has overcome its many struggles and can compete with larger, better capitalized rivals to lead the industry in technological innovation for next-generation cars.The company’s debt pile is high as well, amounting to $13.42 billion at the end of 2019.Tesla reported a 4.9% operating margin in the fourth quarter and said Model Y production and the Shanghai factory ramp-up were likely to weigh on margins temporarily.Its new initiatives, which also include the construction of its first European factory in Germany, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features, are also likely to put a strain on its cash pile.Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $105 million, or 56 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, from $140 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $7.38 billion from $7.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.02 billion. (bit.ly/2GvolcO)(GRAPHIC-Tesla debt and cash flow - )	-5.932804083
(Reuters) - Audi Sport technical director Joerg Zander is rejoining the Sauber Formula One team after the German manufacturer’s decision to quit the world endurance championship and Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race.“After many years at the top level in endurance motorsport, I am very pleased to become technical director and to undertake the challenge...in the new era of Formula One,�� the German said in a team statement on Monday.Zander, 52, was chief designer at Sauber in 2006 and 2007 when they were owned by BMW and will start work with the Swiss-based team in early 2017.The German also has previous experience with the now-defunct Toyota, BAR-Honda, Honda and Brawn Formula One teams as well as Williams.“This is a very important step for the implementation of our strategic goals, in order to guide the team into a new and successful era,�� team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said.Struggling Sauber have yet to score a point this season and are last in the championship with two races remaining.The team announced a change of ownership in July, with founder Peter Sauber retiring and handing over control to the Swiss investment firm Longbow Finance.Audi announced last month that it was leaving endurance racing to focus on the electric Formula E series.	7.907916703
WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - German luxury automaker Audi on Tuesday topped the annual ranking of new vehicles by influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports, which dropped the best overall vehicle award that Tesla Motors Inc’s Model S luxury car won in prior years.Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit was named best overall brand, based on the magazine’s road testing, reliability, safety and owner satisfaction scores, followed by Fuji Heavy Industries�� Subaru unit, Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand, Porsche and BMW AG.Tesla’s Model S electric car was named best overall car in 2014 and 2015, but this year the magazine opted not to name any best overall vehicle.Jake Fisher, director of auto testing, said because of faltering reliability scores, the Model S is no longer the top ultraluxury car and ranks behind the BMW 750i xDrive, Lexus LS 460L and Audi A8 L. He said Tesla’s quality problems including issues with hatches, door handles, electric motors and batteries have increased as the automaker has ramped up production.“They are having issues and they need to work that out before they introduce new models,�� Fisher said.Consumer Reports unveiled the results in Washington. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and gets survey data from 740,000 owners. Many car shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising.U.S. brands lagged most other automakers, but General Motors Co’s Buick brand ranked seventh, just ahead of Mazda. Motor Corp. The Toyota brand finished in eighth place, ahead of Hyundai Motor Co’s Kia unit and Honda Motor Co’s Honda brand. The Volkswagen brand ranked 15th overall.GM’s top-selling Chevrolet brand ranked 20th, while the GMC brand ranked 23rd and Cadillac 24th.Ford Motor Co’s Ford brand ranked 16th, but its best-selling F-150 pickup truck was named best pickup for the first time since 1999.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV continued to struggle in the rankings. The automaker’s Fiat unit finished last among 30 brands rated, with its Jeep brand in 29th place. FCA’s Dodge and Chrysler brands also rated near the bottom.Tesla did not have enough models tested to be considered for overall brand scores.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Tuesday it would invest $373.8 million in five manufacturing plants in the United States to produce its first American-made hybrid powertrain, as it looks to build more vehicles in the market which it sells.The automaker said the investment would also be used to roll out Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) strategy at its Alabama plant, an initiative that aims to reduce the cost of developing new vehicles, partly by using more common components. (reut.rs/2yr9Twv)The company would also start production of hybrid vehicle transmissions at its Buffalo, West Virginia facility and expand its 2.5-liter engine capacity at Georgetown, Kentucky, Toyota said.“This latest wave of investment represents our efforts to localize production of hybrid powertrains to the U.S.,�� said Jeff Moore, senior vice resident, manufacturing.Toyota will modify its plant in Jackson, Tennessee to accommodate production of vehicle transmissions while its Huntsville, Alabama plant would undergo an upgrade enabling it to build engines complementing its strategy, the company said.The projects are set to begin this year and would be operational in 2020, Japan’s biggest auto company said.In January, Toyota’s North America CEO Jim Lentz said the company would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years to meet demand and upgrade plants to build more fuel-efficient models.(Corrects paragraph 3 to say Buffalo, West Virginia, not Wyoming.)	2.255329657
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will return to its pre-Lehman crisis dividend payout ratio of 30 percent, the Nikkei reported, quoting the company's Managing Officer Takuo Sasaki.The automaker maintained a policy of paying out 30 percent of its earnings per share through fiscal 2007, but stopped publishing targets after the Lehman shock in 2008, the paper said.Toyota Motor’s payout ratio came in well above 30 percent even during the financial crisis as it continued to pay dividends despite the strengthening yen eroding its earnings, the Nikkei reported.Sasaki, however, said, “to get investors to hold Toyota stock over the long term, we need stable dividends based on higher profits, not the kind of outlier payout ratios we had in the past.”With its earnings recovering, Toyota has decided to clarify its payout ratio target again, the Japanese daily said.“Our earning power has recovered since the financial crisis, and we are strengthening it further,�� Sasaki said.Sasaki, however, said the company was not looking at stock buybacks as a possibility, at least for now.The company is resolved to keeping its operating profit at 1 trillion yen ($9.96 billion) or higher, even if the yen skyrockets or economic conditions deteriorate abruptly, Sasaki said.($1 = 100.4250 Japanese yen)	3.206334274
TOKYO (Reuters) - Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T, the maker of Subaru cars, plans to invest $400 million to expand production capacity at its sole U.S. plant in Indiana by around 100,000 vehicles, the Japanese automaker said on Wednesday.The company, which exports nearly 70 percent of its Japan-made production, wants to make more vehicles in its biggest market, the United States, to limit the impact of currency moves.Along with the expansion, which will utilize an existing line, Fuji Heavy is set to hire about 900 employees at the Subaru of Indiana factory, CEO Yasuyuki Yoshinaga told reporters.“We continue to see strong sales in the United States, and we were seeing a situation in which there was a lack of car supply,�� Yoshinaga said. “We think this will contribute to the regional economy of Indiana.”The plant will start to produce the Impreza compact car using the added capacity, he said, the first time the Impreza will be produced outside of Japan.The carmaker currently produces Outback, Legacy and Tribeca at its plant in Indiana, as well as Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Camry. Toyota owns 16.47 percent of Fuji Heavy shares.The plant currently has an annual capacity of 270,000 vehicles, of which 100,000 is devoted to the Camry. The capacity for Toyota’s Camry will stay at 100,000 vehicles, Yoshinaga said.The $400 million investment will boost total capacity to 400,000 vehicles by end-2016.Fuji Heavy, Japan’s smallest carmaker by volume, booked on Wednesday a record annual operating profit of 120.4 billion yen ($1.22 billion) for the financial year ended March, more than double the 44 billion yen it booked in the previous year, on strong sales in the United States, aided by the yen’s depreciation versus the dollar.	2.547824615
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber’s autonomous vehicle unit has raised $1 billion from a consortium of investors including SoftBank Group Corp, giving the company a much-needed funding boost for its pricey self-driving ambitions on the eve of its public stock offering.Uber Technologies Inc said on Thursday that the investment values its Advanced Technologies Group, which works to develop autonomous driving technology, at $7.25 billion. SoftBank will invest $333 million from its $100 billion Vision Fund, while Toyota Motor Corp and automotive parts supplier Denso Corp will invest a combined $667 million.Toyota will also contribute up to an additional $300 million over the next three years to help cover the costs of building commercial self-driving vehicles, Uber said.Reuters had reported in March talks of the investment in ATG.Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the funding “will help maintain Uber’s position at the forefront of�� a transforming transportation industry.The funding allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors. That is likely to appease some of Wall Street’s concerns over Uber’s spending on the autonomous unit, which has topped $1.07 billion since the program started in 2016.In its filing for an initial public offering this month, Uber cautioned that development of self-driving technology “is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful�� and the company lagged certain competitors.The self-driving business unit brings in no meaningful revenue for Uber, which last year lost $3.03 billion.As part of the investment, ATG becomes its own legal entity but remains under the control of Uber. A new ATG board will be formed, with six directors appointed from Uber, one from SoftBank and one from Toyota. Eric Meyhofer, currently the head of ATG, will take the title of CEO and report to the new board.Such sizeable deals are unusual for companies so close to an IPO, because bringing in large new investors changes the company’s capital structure.Uber is preparing to launch its “roadshow,�� when it will pitch its company prospective investors, the week of April 29, setting up for an early May debut on the New York Stock Exchange. It is expected to raise $10 billion at a $90 billion to $100 billion valuation.The transaction is expected to close the third quarter. The deal, however, will almost certainly require approval from the inter-agency regulatory group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).A law enacted last year expands that group’s powers to review minority stakes by foreign investors in startups with certain sensitive technologies, and self-driving technology is widely considered to have defense applications.SoftBank’s investment in General Motors Co’s self-driving car unit Cruise is still under CFIUS review and is likely weeks away from any decision, even though that investment was announced nearly a year ago.Both SoftBank and Toyota are repeat Uber investors. SoftBank took a more than 16 percent stake in the company after investing around $8 billion last year, becoming its largest shareholder. Toyota invested in Uber in 2016 and again in August with a $500 million check to work jointly to develop self-driving cars.The investment comes despite growing disillusion with the self-driving business, which has failed to deliver on bold promises of commercial autonomous cars, and Uber’s setbacks. A crash in March 2018 involving an Uber self-driving SUV killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, and forced the company to shutter its biggest testing operation and halt autonomous driving in other cities.Uber now has a small number of cars testing in Pittsburgh, during the day and in good weather, with two safety drivers. They do not offer rides to passengers.The Tempe crash hurt the entire industry, say self-driving company executives, dealing a blow to public confidence in the safety of robot cars.ATG chief scientist Raquel Urtasun said in an interview with Reuters this month it “is not clear�� when self-driving cars will be deployed at a large scale, and for the next decade at least there will be a mix of robot and human-controlled cars.	-4.872744845
BEIJING, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two Chinese joint ventures sold about 92,300 vehicles in China in November, up 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday.That followed an 27.1 percent year-on-year jump in October and a 26.1 percent rise in September.

(Adds Honda comments, paragraphs 8-9)Jan 31 (Reuters) - The auto industry’s air bag troubles deepened on Saturday as U.S. federal safety regulators said three big automakers will recall about 2.1 million older vehicles to fix defects that could cause air bags to deploy when they are not supposed to.The vehicles involved in the recall announced by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are made by Toyota Motor Corp, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co.There have been about 400 reported cases of inadvertent air bag deployments in the recalled vehicles, NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said. The incidents have caused some minor injuries, but no known deaths, he told reporters.The recall concerned a defective chip in air bag systems and the fix involved replacing the entire air bag module, including circuits manufactured by parts maker TRW Automotive Holdings , Rosekind said.The automakers involved had issued three earlier recalls to fix the chip problems. But the NHTSA said it had reports that 39 vehicles fixed under those actions had experienced inadvertent air bag deployments, hence the new recall.It was not related to millions of vehicles recalled over Takata Corp air bags. U.S. safety regulators have said defective Takata air bag inflators in certain vehicles can rupture and spray metal fragments inside the vehicle.Air bag failures were also central to the controversy last year over General Motors Co’s delay in recalling millions of vehicles with defective ignition switches that could unexpectedly cut off power to the safety systems.Honda said that approximately 374,000 Honda and Acura vehicles are affected in the United States.“Honda has received a small number of complaints of inadvertent airbag deployment in these vehicles after the original recall repair was completed,�� Honda said in a statement. “No crashes have been reported to Honda related to this issue.”Noting potential consumer concerns about air bags, the NHTSA said the chances of being involved in a crash in which an air bag could prevent serious injury or death were far greater than the risk of serious injury from an inadvertent bag deployment.NHTSA blamed the problems it reported on Saturday on “electrical noise�� in the air bag system. It said a fully effective solution might not be available until late this year.The agency said the models affected were: 2002-2003 Jeep Liberty and 2002-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees (about 750,000 vehicles); 2003-2004 Honda Odyssey; and 2003 Acura MDX (about 370,000 vehicles) and 2003-2004 Pontiac Vibe; Dodge Viper; and Toyota Corolla, Toyota Matrix, and Toyota Avalon (about 1 million vehicles, not all of which were sold in the United States.)The agency said the affected models had a part called an electronic control unit that controls deployment of its air bags. TRW supplied control units containing the same control circuit to all three automakers.Although the recalls were not related to the Takata cases, the NHTSA said there was an overlap, in that about 1 million of the vehicles affected were also covered in separate recalls of Takata air bag inflator systems.The recall highlights the difficulty automakers and regulators have with increasingly complex electronic systems. The agency said in a statement it could take several months for the companies to obtain enough parts to fix all the vehicles involved.In the Takata cases, Honda on Friday said it has confirmed that a Takata air bag inflator ruptured in a Jan. 18 crash in Texas that killed the driver. Prior to that incident, air bags made by the Japanese company had been linked to at least five deaths.

(This July 28 story was corrected to state in sixth paragraph that Toyota is reporting first-quarter, not first-half, results on Tuesday; also corrects day in advisory line to Tuesday)MUNICH/TOKYO (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE overtook Toyota 7203.T as the world's largest carmaker by sales in the first half year, achieving its long-held ambition three years ahead of target.But staying on top will be a challenge for the German maker of the Golf and Polo, as deliveries are falling in China, destination of a third of its global sales, making it overly reliant on relatively stagnant western European demand.“The hunt for scale only makes sense if it boosts synergies, something VW hasn’t really been able to achieve,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank. “Dependence on China is VW’s weak spot and managing such a large group inevitably poses problems.”VW has been pushing for greater scale under Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn’s eight-year reign, propelled by adding brands and factories and roaring sales in China.The German group on July 17 reported 5.04 million deliveries in the first half year. By comparison, Toyota said on Tuesday it sold 5.02 million cars between January and June, a 1.5 percent decline on year-ago levels.Toyota, due to announce first-quarter earnings next Tuesday, said sales were dragged down by a slowdown in emerging markets and increased taxes on mini vehicles in Japan.VW’s rapid expansion has masked underperformance in the United States and Brazil, where it has been slow to upgrade models and adjust its offerings to market trends, analysts say.Although boosting market share and brand awareness, VW’s race for volume has triggered a costly proliferation of models and equipment, especially in its core passenger-car brand where profit margins have languished amid growing inefficiencies.With over 310 models and nearly 120 factories worldwide, VW’s size may be turning into a disadvantage, forming the backdrop to a leadership crisis in April when ex-chairman Ferdinand Piech was ousted after publicly criticizing CEO Winterkorn.VW’s top management has since been trying to regain the initiative, though other top players, notably its unions and stakeholder Lower Saxony, are seeking to influence the course of its move to a leaner structure as VW is pushing 5 billion euros of cost savings in its core division.Wolfsburg-based VW last year started shifting its focus to boosting earnings quality to help fund growing technology needs and plant upgrades.VW has a goal of “moderately�� raising deliveries from last year’s record 10.14 million cars. The group will publish first-half results on Wednesday.	-11.68343595
PARIS, April 18 (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen and Toyota are in talks to share vehicle production at a factory in northern France, President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a newspaper interview.Sarkozy, who last week summoned Peugeot Chief Executive Philippe Varin for talks on another threatened plant, told La Voix du Nord that the Sevelnord facility was likely to be saved by the new partnership.“Sevelnord will be OK,�� the French president was quoted as saying, before adding that he had discussed the plant with Varin. “My understanding is that there’s a deal in discussion with Toyota for light commercial vehicles.”The French president did not say whether Toyota was the only potential Sevelnord partner in talks with Peugeot.Europe’s auto industry is grappling with excess capacity and cut-throat price competition as overall demand sags under the weight of the debt crisis. All major car makers except Volkswagen lost money in the region last year.Auto workers at Peugeot and at GM’s Opel unit are braced for a fight with management as a clearer picture emerges of the job cuts and plant closures likely to result from their cost-cutting alliance, announced in February.The Sevelnord factory near Valenciennes employs some 2,800 workers and produces Peugeot Expert, Citroen Jumpy and Fiat Scudo delivery vans. Italy’s Fiat is withdrawing from the venture in 2017, and Peugeot’s Varin said in January he was seeking a new partner to take its place.Toyota, which has ruled out buying a stake in Sevelnord, declined to comment on Sarkozy’s remarks or say whether there were plans for the factory to assemble vehicles under the Japanese automaker’s brand. Peugeot also had no comment.Peugeot unions are seeking to put feared plant closures at the centre of France’s presidential election campaign, which culminates with a second round of voting on May 6.Sarkozy, who is trailing Socialist challenger Francois Hollande in opinion polls, summoned Varin talks after workers from Peugeot’s Aulnay plant near Paris organised a protest outside his campaign headquarters.	-6.223254677

In his sophomore season in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series -- and his first with veteran crew chief Chad Knaus -- William Byron continues to make history.On Saturday at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina, Byron covered the 1.366-mile distance at the egg-shaped track in 28.510 seconds (172.487 mph), winning the pole position for Sunday’s Bojangles�� Southern 500 (6 p.m. ET on NBCSN, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).Not only did Byron claim his first Busch Pole Award at Darlington and his fourth of the season, he also became part of an elite triumvirate. Before his pole-winning run on Saturday, only Fireball Roberts in 1962 and Bill Elliott in 1985 had ever won poles for the Daytona 500, the Coca-Cola 600 and the Southern 500 in the same season.With his fourth career pole, Byron is now a member of that exclusive club.Byron acknowledged that he and Knaus have concentrated on qualifying at the marquee races, but with Darlington being an impound event, there’s a necessary compromise between race and qualifying setups.“Our race setup (at Darlington) was good in qualifying trim,�� Byron said. “It just happened to work out that way that we focused on qualifying, and I’m sure Chad puts his extra little bit into, too, and I kind of put my extra couple cents into it to make sure I hit everything right.“I felt good driving down here this morning. Only having to make one lap today is pretty easy, so I said, ‘Go on out there and try to not screw up and make a good lap.”Driving a throwback City Chevrolet paint scheme on his No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Camaro -- a nod to the movie “Days of Thunder�� -- Byron did exactly that, edging Ford driver and defending race winner Brad Keselowski (172.088 mph) for the top starting spot by .066 seconds.The Chip Ganassi Racing duo of Kyle Larson (171.842 mph) and Kurt Busch (171.764 mph) earned the third and fourth starting positions for Sunday’s race. A pair of drivers fighting for the final playoff positions -- Daniel Suarez and Jimmie Johnson -- will start fifth and sixth respectively.Two-time Darlington winner Denny Hamlin qualified ninth in the fastest Toyota.Ryan Newman, 15th in the standings, will start 24th as he tries to hold on to his provisional playoff spot.“I’m not happy with it because we’re not P1, but I felt like I got everything I could as far as driving out of it,�� Newman said. “It’s kind of a crapshoot. We’re wide open from Turn 4 to Turn 3, and however you get through 3 and 4 coming to your green, and then your timed lap is where it’s all at.“It’s my favorite race track. I’m looking forward to the race. I feel like we’ve got a car that drives fairly good. I just don’t know that we have the speed that it takes to be as good as we need to be.”Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Qualifying -- 70th Annual Bojangles�� Southern 500Darlington RacewayDarlington, South CarolinaSaturday, August 31, 20191.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Didi Chuxing signed an agreement with German automotive supplier Continental AG on Tuesday to cooperate in developing internet-connected, electric cars tailor-made for Didi’s ride hailing services.Didi currently uses regular passenger cars for its service, but has said it needs more dedicated “purpose-built�� vehicles.These are set to be electric cars that industry experts say may start replacing staples such as the Buick GL8 minivan or the Toyota Camry in congested cities such as Beijing and Shanghai as people increasingly use ride-hailing and shared-car services.Didi wants to build a fleet of connected, environment-friendly cars with more comfortable seats and luggage space, sources close to the company have told Reuters.The agreement between Didi and Continental follows an alliance that Didi formed with the German company and 30 other auto industry partners in April, including China’s GAC Motor and BAIC Group, as well as Toyota Motor Corp.“Based on Didi’s practical experience on mobility as well as Continental’s advanced products and technologies ... the parties will explore cooperation mainly in the areas of intelligent &amp; connected vehicles (ICV) and customized new energy vehicles,�� Didi said in a statement on Tuesday.A vehicle adapted to Didi’s needs is expected to roll out by 2020, the company said. The two companies signed the agreement in Shanghai on Tuesday.	-2.955055311
TROY, Michigan (Reuters) - For nearly two years, a team of former Chevrolet Volt and Toyota Prius engineers has been working on the next big thing in electric cars: the latest version of the 154-year-old lead-acid battery.Their aim is to build a battery strong enough to power a wider range of vehicles, something they think the current cutting-edge technology - lithium ion - can’t do cheaply, particularly given recent safety scares.The focus of Energy Power Systems on a technology older than the automobile itself illustrates the difficulty with lithium-ion batteries. While widely used in everything from laptops to electric cars and satellites, a number of high-profile incidents involving smoke and fire have been a reminder of the risks and given them an image problem.The overheating of the batteries on two of Boeing Co's BA.N high-tech 787 Dreamliners, which prompted regulators to ground the aircraft, served to underline the concerns and forced the plane maker to redesign the battery system.On Thursday, battery experts will gather in Washington, D.C., to discuss the technology in a forum organized by the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation of one of the 787 incidents.Experts are certain to point out red flags. Indeed, a growing number of engineers now say the lithium-ion battery revolution has stalled, undercut by high costs, technical complexity and safety concerns.“Smart people have been working on this for 10 years already and no one is close to a new kind of battery,�� said Fred Schlachter, a lithium-ion battery expert and retired physicist from the U.S.-funded Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Many experts now believe it will take at least another decade for lithium-ion technology to be ready for widespread adoption in transportation. Others, including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, believe the solution lies beyond lithium-ion.Interviews with two dozen battery executives, experts and researchers, including the founder of Securaplane, which made Boeing’s battery charger, reveal an industry in which some are having second thoughts about using lithium-ion, and are instead looking to enhance previous technologies or to leap ahead.These people say expectations were set too high, too fast. People projected that “clean technology�� batteries would shrink in size and weight at the speed of the microchip revolution. That hasn’t happened, and Schlachter says it won’t any time soon. “We’re not going to see a different chemistry, unless we’re very lucky, for decades.”Just as recent developments in technology have allowed cars to improve their mileage using traditional engines, the lead-acid battery research is aiming for improved power in a smaller package.Lithium-ion supporters, including Boeing, Tesla Motors Co TSLA.O and General Motors Co GM.N, maker of the Volt, say they can make the batteries safe, and problems with new technologies are to be expected.GM overcame an early problem when a Volt caught fire during tests run by the U.S. National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, for instance, and after all, car and plane engineers successfully tamed gasoline and jet fuel.“GM is committed to lithium-ion technology for our vehicle electrification solutions,�� the largest U.S. automaker said in a statement, adding that it has been seeing “improved economies�� on the technology.Boeing said it has years of experience with the technology and is confident in its safety and reliability. “Nothing that we’ve learned as a result of the ongoing investigations has caused to change the decision to use lithium-ion batteries,�� said the company in a statement.Tom Gage, a battery expert whose company EV Grid works on ways to manage the charging of electric cars, says lithium-ion may be a little more “tempestuous�� than other technologies, but is the best industry now has and he’s confident it will improve.“It’s just a technological challenge,�� he said.But other companies are looking beyond the technology. Toyota, for example, has tasked one team of battery engineers to explore a range of alternatives to lithium-ion.“We don’t think that lithium-ion batteries are going to help us get to a point where we can dramatically increase volume and really call it a mass market,�� Toyota spokesman John Hanson said. “We’re going to have a more significant breakthrough and probably go into some other area of battery chemistry.”Subhash Dhar, who founded Energy Power Systems, the advanced lead-acid battery company, said promised improvements with lithium ion were never met.Dhar, who helped develop the nickel-metal hydride battery for the Toyota Prius, described his own “disenchantment�� with lithium-ion’s complexity and cost.“Before the technology was fully optimized and before the markets were ready, we just kind of threw billions of dollars in setting up these manufacturing plants,�� Dhar said. “They’re all sitting idle right now.”In February 2010, the U.S. government gave more than $150 million to help build a lithium-ion battery factory owned by a unit of Korea's LG Group 051910.KS, LG Chem Ltd. The plant was supposed to make enough battery cells for 60,000 electric vehicles by the end of 2013.But the demand never materialized. A U.S. Department of Energy report described the Holland, Michigan factory as a place where workers spent their days playing board games, watching movies or volunteering at a local animal shelter.The Volt battery makes the case for critics and fans. After initial problems, it has worked without incident. But to keep it safe, the battery has more parts than the rest of the car combined, including 600 seals and cooling components.“That’s 600 seals that all have to stay for the entirety of its life otherwise you have catastrophic failures,�� said Josh Payne, who worked on the first Volt battery and is now senior engineering manager at Troy, Michigan-based Energy Power Systems. GM has repeatedly said the Volt battery is safe.Lithium-ion batteries have been used to power electronics like camcorders, cell phones and laptops since 1992, and the Economist magazine in 2002 hailed them as the “foot soldiers of the digital revolution.”The batteries also were flammable. Some early laptops burned spectacularly, but the consumer electronics industry largely solved the problem. That set up expectations that bigger batteries would be tamed as well.Inside the aviation industry, however, experts are wary.“These things go into a flare type burn. I call it a whoosh. It is not an explosion per se,�� said aviation consultant Richard Lukso. “I’ve heard that whoosh four times, so I know what I’m talking about.”Lukso founded Securaplane, the company that made the battery charger for the 787. He left to found a lithium-ion battery startup, but after spending $6 million, failed to build a lithium-ion battery safe enough for planes.Lukso was startled by how difficult it was to track what was happening inside the battery. New microchips do the job, but he did not have them when he closed his company several years ago.Meanwhile, Lukso faced the same problem as Boeing - once a fire got started in a big lithium-ion battery, it is tough to put out, since it creates its own oxygen and has its own fuel. The cost and weight of safeguards to stop heat spreading between cells, and to contain a fire, offset lithium-ion’s advantages.Boeing rival Airbus dropped lithium-ion batteries for its next passenger jet, the A350, to let the technology “mature.”�They are definitely powerful and they’re more advanced,�� said Subhas Chalasani, an engineer who consulted for Boeing on the 787 battery and previously worked at GM. “But you’ve got to babysit them.“We need, at various levels, some kind of breakthrough so we can make this technology more robust and safe,�� added Chalasani, who declined to specifically discuss his time at Boeing.Chalasani is not working on that lithium-ion breakthrough. He’s working at East Penn Manufacturing Co on advanced lead-acid batteries.	11.49108292
SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 (Reuters) - Uber’s autonomous vehicle unit has raised $1 billion from a consortium of investors including SoftBank Group Corp, giving the company a much-needed funding boost for its pricey self-driving ambitions on the eve of its public stock offering.Uber Technologies Inc IPO-UBER.N said on Thursday that the investment valued its Advanced Technologies Group, which works to develop autonomous driving technology, at $7.25 billion. SoftBank will invest $333 million from its $100 billion Vision Fund, while Toyota Motor Corp and automotive company Denso Corp will combined invest $667 million.Reuters had reported in March talks of the investment in ATG, which has locations in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The funding allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors. That is likely to appease some investor concerns over Uber’s spending on the autonomous unit, which has topped $1 billion since the program started in 2016.The business unit brings in no meaningful revenue for Uber, which last year lost $3.03 billion. The company is not even offering free rides in the robot cars to passengers, like some of its rivals are, following a fatal crash last year in Arizona involving an Uber self-driving SUV.Uber released its IPO filing this month and is preparing to launch is “roadshow,�� when it will pitch its company prospective investors, the week of April 29, setting up for an early May debut on the New York Stock Exchange.Uber is expected to raise $10 billion at a $90 billion to $100 billion valuation, at least an 18 percent jump from its current $76 billion valuation.As part of the deal, ATG becomes its own legal entity but remains under the control of Uber with its financial performance folded into Uber’s. A new ATG board will be formed, with six seats from Uber, one from SoftBank and one from Toyota. Eric Meyhofer, currently the head of ATG, will take the title of CEO and report to the new board.Such sizeable deals are unusual for companies so close to an IPO, because bringing in large new investors changes the company’s capital structure. The deal, however, will almost certainly require approval from the inter-agency regulatory group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).A law enacted last year expands that group’s powers to review minority stakes by foreign investors in startups with certain sensitive technologies, and self-driving technology is widely considered to have defense applications.SoftBank’s investment in General Motors Co’s self-driving car unit Cruise is still under CFIUS review and is likely weeks away from a decision, even though that investment was announced more than a year ago.	-4.872744845
DETROIT, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp erased a black mark on its reputation for quality on Thursday when Consumer Reports restored a recommended rating for the flagship Camry sedan less than two months after the influential magazine had pulled the rating due to poor crash test results a year ago.The 2014 Camry was retested this month by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and its rating raised from poor to acceptable in a year-old IIHS test procedure.The group said the Camry was rated a top safety pick “after Toyota made changes to the structure of the front end for 2014 models built after November 1,�� according to IIHS spokeswoman Kristin Nevels.Consumer Reports said it was reinstating its recommended rating “based on the Camry’s performance in the latest IIHS small frontal-overlap test��. The procedure is designed to emulate a collision involving the front corner of a vehicle and another vehicle or large object.In late October, the influential magazine said it would no longer recommend the Camry, the Prius v hybrid or the RAV4 sport utility vehicle because they received “poor�� ratings last December in the IIHS small frontal-overlap test.Consumer Reports is one of the most widely trusted names for consumers shopping for cars, and companies try to ensure their vehicles earn the magazine’s coveted “recommended�� rating.The IIHS, a non-profit group funded by the insurance industry, last year increased the rigor of its tests.Consumer Reports waited to adjust its buyer recommendations until it saw how the entire industry was affected by the test.The magazine does not recommend consumers buy a car that fares poorly in any crash tests.Through the first 11 months, Camry was the best-selling passenger car in the United States, with sales of 378,520.In its latest round of testing 2014 models, the IIHS said 22 vehicles received the highest safety rating and another 17, including the Camry, got the next highest rating.Among the redesigned 2014 models that received the top safety pick+ rating were Honda Motor Co’s Acura MDX and RLX, Nissan Motor Co’s Infiniti Q50, the Mazda 3 and the Toyota Highlander.	1.474180777

BOSTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Two security experts who a year ago exposed methods for hacking the Toyota Prius and Ford Escape say they have developed technology that would keep automobiles safe from cyber attacks.At last summer’s Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas, the two researchers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller, described ways to launch dangerous attacks, including manipulating the brakes of the moving Prius and the Ford Escape.Valasek told Reuters on Tuesday that he and Miller will show off a prototype vehicle “intrusion prevention device�� at next month’s Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas.They built the device with about $150 in electronics parts, though the real “secret sauce�� is a set of computer algorithms that listen to traffic in a car’s network to understand how things are supposed to work. When an attack occurs, the device identifies traffic anomalies and blocks rogue activity, Valasek said.The two well-known computer experts decided to pursue the project because they wanted to help automakers identify ways to defend against security vulnerabilities in their products.“I really don’t care if you hack my browser and steal my credit card,�� Valasek said. “But crashing a car is life or death. It is dramatic. We wanted to be part of the solution.”The research the two have released on the Ford and Toyota cars, as well as work by other experts on different types of vehicles, has raised concerns that somebody might one day try to replicate their work to launch a real-life attack.Yet the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement on Tuesday that it is not aware of any incidents of consumer vehicle control systems having been hacked.The auto industry has beefed up efforts to identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity risks over the past few years.“Cyber security is a global concern and it is a growing threat for all industries, including the automotive,�� said Jack Pokrzywa, manager of global ground vehicle standards with SAE International, a group that represents industry engineers.Pokrzywa declined to comment on the specifics of the new technology from Valasek and Miller, though he said “Any viable solution reducing cyber threats is a step in the right direction.”A representative for Ford said she had no immediate comment on the device. Officials with Toyota could not be reached for comment. (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Dan Grebler)	-4.471238382

SHANGHAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Executives at Toyota Motor Corp said the Chinese government is taking an “initial�� look into the auto parts policies of its premium brand Lexus as regulators conduct probes into possible monopoly behaviour across the industry.Two Beijing-based Toyota executives said the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is making initial enquiries about Lexus via the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), which has been conducting an industry-wide survey since April.Nearly all of the survey questions were focused on Lexus’s spare and replacement parts policies, including pricing, the executives said.“At one point during the long process of answering all questions in the survey, CADA people told us the regulators mean business this time, and told us to take the survey seriously,�� one of the executives said.China is ramping up efforts to bring foreign companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008, having taken aim at industries as varied as milk powder and jewellery. Regulators have recently widened their probes to sectors including pharmaceuticals, electronics and autos.Earlier this week, Chinese regulators said they would punish Volkswagen AG’s Audi brand and Fiat SpA’s Chrysler for monopoly practices, potentially paving the way for the automakers to be fined up to 10 percent of their local annual revenue in the world’s biggest car market.According to the two executives, Toyota’s legal department in Beijing has provided written answers and evidence in “several thick binders��. The survey was capped by a visit by a CADA official to Lexus’s office in Beijing last month, they said.The executives said their understanding is that CADA earlier this year had sent similar surveys to a dozen other foreign brands operating in China.“In our case, the inquiry focused on spare parts. They asked about our spare parts prices, whether or not dealers are able to procure spare parts from any supplier, among other things,�� said one of the two Toyota executives, both of whom asked not to be identified because the inquiry is ongoing.“Our guess is that they wanted to make sure we’re not too tightly controlling provision of spare parts to dealers, making sure dealers are allowed to buy spare parts not just from Lexus but other sources.”Takanori Yokoi, a Beijing-based Toyota spokesman, declined to comment, but said Toyota would “cooperate�� with Chinese authorities if there was an investigation into anti-competitive matters.Earlier this week, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz unit said it was cooperating with China’s anti-monopoly authorities over an investigation into unspecified matters, after Chinese media reported the German carmaker’s Shanghai office had been raided.Lexus brings in from Japan and elsewhere outside China all of the vehicles it sells in China. Last year, it sold about 73,000 vehicles. (Editing by Ryan Woo)	-1.351695996
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei average was seen treading in range on Wednesday as investors took profits ahead of the key 9,500 level, while the initial euphoria over Greece’s second bailout cooled and turned to concern over Athen’s ability to stick to painful cuts.Market players said the Nikkei was likely to trade between 9,400 to 9,550 on Wednesday after Nikkei futures in Chicago closed at 9,480, down 10 points or 0.1 percent, from the Osaka close of 9,490.“The market lacks a sense of direction today and will be stuck in recent ranges as we are at a level that prompts many investors to take profit,�� said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.“I think it is a definite possibility for the benchmark to briefly top the 9,500 level, but without some positive factor to boost the index, it’s unlikely to break out of the range,�� he said.Market players said they will be watching forex moves to see if the Japanese currency could soften further against the dollar and the euro.The dollar was last trading at 79.70 yen, easing from a six-month high hit on Monday.On Tuesday, the Nikkei failed to top its resistance at 9,500, slipping 0.2 percent to 9,463.02, while the broader Topix .TOPX edged down 0.3 percent to 816.29.The Nikkei is up 7.5 percent this month, taking this year’s gains so far to more than 11 percent, supported by a run of strong economic data out of the United States, as well as the European Central Bank’s liquidity injection of nearly half a trillion euros and further easing steps by the Bank of Japan.Wall Street ended little changed overnight, paring gains after the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI briefly topped 13,000. &gt; Wall St loses steam after Dow hits 13,000 .N--TOYOTA 7203.TToyota Motor Corp is considering importing cars to South Korea from Europe, the head of its South Korean unit said on Tuesday, a possible move aimed at further cutting reliance on the neighboring Japan for shipments amid the yen’s strength.--UNIVERSAL ENTERTAINMENT 6425.OSWynn Resorts Ltd WYNN.O plans to give evidence to U.S. authorities that claims its board member Kazuo Okada, chairman of Japanese Universal Entertainment Corp and largest shareholder of Wynn, bribed foreign gaming regulators and may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.--SUMITOMO CHEMICAL 4005.TSumitomo Chemical Co Ltd hopes to go ahead with the expansion of the Petro Rabigh petrochemical complex with state-run Saudi Aramco but is still unsure if it makes economic sense, a senior executive at the Japanese firm told Reuters.--TOYOTA INDUSTRIES 6202.TToyota Industries Corp will take a 7.3 percent stake in Seibu Electric &amp; Machinery Co Ltd 6144.T next month through a private placement of shares worth about 400 million yen and outsource production of warehouse equipment, the Nikkei business daily said on Tuesday.	-0.6523544064

"(Reuters) - Texas auto dealer Hayden Elder says March was his worst month in 42 years selling cars thanks to the coronavirus, but April brought days that were “almost normal�� and he expects bigger customer discounts to help him sell more Dodge Ram pickup trucks this month.The virus outbreak and resulting stay-at-home orders have clobbered the U.S. vehicle market.But from his corner of Texas, which pushed ahead on Friday with a phased relaxation of restrictions put in place to curb the virus, Elder sees enhanced incentives from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MIFCAU.N playing a big part in boosting sales.“I think that will open the door for a ton of orders for the factory,�� said Elder, who owns two Dodge, Jeep and Ram dealerships in a rural eastern region of the populous state. His businesses have remained open as they are considered essential.With levels of unemployment not seen since the Great Depression - 30.3 million Americans filed jobless claims from March 21 to April 25 - it is difficult to predict the level of demand for new vehicles.Jeff Schuster, president of the Americas for consultancy LMC Automotive, said the market should rebound in the second half of the year, but 2020 sales could be up to 25% lower than 2019.“Until we get plants up and running and the economy restarted, we’re in uncertain territory,�� he said.That uncertainty is even greater if America experiences a second wave of COVID-19 infections.Automakers have been burning through money while their plants are shuttered. Many industry experts agree that larger discounts could generate demand and cash flow when they reopen, even if they erode carmakers�� profit margins.Used cars have been piling up at auction lots since the coronavirus crisis began. New imported vehicles now clog major ports. Dealerships across much of the country are closed.On Friday, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said its sales plummeted 54% in April, while Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T reported drops of 39% and 45% respectively.As states begin to reopen, the next months will be turbulent and the pace of recovery will vary by state, industry officials, analysts and dealers said.Some automakers have already taken advantage of cheap money to offer no-interest loans for up to seven years.Auto retailer Sonic Automotive Inc's SAH.N Chief Executive David Smith said this week that automakers' current discounts were already unprecedented. They pushed sales higher in late April and will hopefully boost them further in the second and third quarters, he said.“I’ve never seen that level of incentives,�� Smith said.Automakers in the United States can look to China for some inspiration. Sales there have rebounded since virus lockdowns lifted.""My belief is that demand will come back fairly well,"" Ford Motor Co F.N Chief Executive Jim Hackett said on Friday during an online interview with the Washington Post. Industry officials have also talked about the need for Washington to help.“Certainly we believe that some level of government stimulus post crisis to help customers and the auto industry to recover would be appropriate,�� Ford’s U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve told Reuters last month.One wild card for the new vehicle market is the way the coronavirus has disrupted the used U.S. vehicle market, where about 40 million cars and trucks change hands a year.More than 4 million low-mileage, nearly-new lease vehicles are due to return to the market this year, at a rate of around 340,000 per month. That could push used vehicle prices down in the near term, hurting new vehicle pricing and demand, industry officials said.Scott Cooke, chief financial officer of Toyota’s U.S. captive finance arm, said the Japanese automaker does not have excess inventory on dealer lots, but is seeing a build-up of customers in lockdown states unable to return vehicles that have reached the end of their lease.Cox Automotive economist Charlie Smoke said late last month that “competition for these off-lease customers will be fierce,�� with automakers dangling discounts for their business.Some automakers have extended consumers�� leases to keep their cars out of the used vehicle market logjam. As of late April, used-car auction house Manheim, a unit of Cox, was holding about 40% more off-lease inventory for corporate customers versus a year earlier, rather than flood the market and undercut resale prices.George Augustaitis, director of automotive industry analytics at CarGurus Inc CARG.O, an online marketplace for new and used cars, said automakers' captive finance arms have many tools to manage the used car glut - from discounts, to financing deals and attractive lease programs.“That can draw people back to the new market,�� Augustaitis said.The risk for automakers that offer aggressive discounts is that customers will demand them for the long term, hurting margins, said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at consultancy AlixPartners.“Those things are hard to walk back,�� he said.But back in Texas, Elder said that with the right attitude and well-placed discounts, the U.S. economy will come roaring back.“It’s going to be fun around here again,�� he said.In tough times, Americans preferred used cars:"	5.083633978
"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus brand is planning to launch a second top-of-the-line ""flagship"" model to accompany a new generation of its LS sedan, the head of the brand's U.S. operations told Reuters on Wednesday.“We need a flagship. It doesn’t have to be a sedan,�� Jeff Bracken, Lexus division general manager, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference.Bracken noted the success of luxury sport utility vehicles such as Tata Motors' TAMO.NS Land Rover brand, the Cadillac Escalade from General Motors Co GM.N and large SUVs coming from the German luxury automakers.Luxury SUV sales have grown more quickly than sales of large luxury sedans, which have for decades anchored the top ends of the model lines of luxury auto brands. The SUV surge has prompted even luxury brands with no history of selling SUVs, such as BMW's BMWG.DE Rolls-Royce, to develop models to compete in the super luxury SUV segment.U.S. sales have been supported by a prolonged drop in gasoline prices. Average prices at the pump on Tuesday were $2.63, down 25 percent from a year ago, according to the AAA travel group.“In addition to the LS (a large sedan), there could be another flagship in our lineup,�� Bracken said. “We’ll define what it is in January.”Lexus also is looking to strengthen its SUV lineup by offering a version of the midsize RX SUV with a third row seat. An RX with room for seven or eight passengers is the No. 1 request from U.S. Lexus dealers, Bracken said. A new RX is due this fall but will not have a third row seat.“We don’t want to wait for a next generation�� to add the extra seating row, Bracken said."	-5.876872914
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE has abandoned its decades-old obsession with empire building and no-expense-spared engineering to free up resources for the development and mass production of electric cars, its CEO Herbert Diess told Reuters.A global clampdown on toxic exhaust fumes has triggered a new wave of consolidation in the auto industry as carmakers look for ways to slash development costs for low-emission and self-driving technologies.While rivals such as FiatChrysler and Renault explore a $35 billion deal to bulk up, Volkswagen is taking the opposite approach: slimming down.“We don’t need more brands. With very few exceptions we can tap the world’s large profit segments with our existing brands,�� Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters at the Frankfurt auto show.VW is spending 80 billion euros ($88.55 billion) to buy battery cells and develop electric cars and has struck a broad alliance with Ford to help share development and manufacturing costs.Volkswagen grew into a multi-brand empire under the leadership of Ferdinand Piech, the company’s chief executive and chairman between 1993 and 2015, whose aggressive expansion resulted in the acquisition of Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini in a single year.Today the German company has 660,000 employees and owns the Seat, Skoda, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Ducati and Audi brands in addition Scania, MAN and VW.Piech, who passed away last month, took pride in emphasizing engineering brilliance ahead of earnings, a culture which caused VW’s profitability to lag behind rivals such as Toyota and Peugeot.Diess told Reuters that creating the best product without regard to costs is a perilous strategy in today’s world, given the task of overhauling combustion engines at the same time as developing new technologies.“The product experience needs to be right. But you need to keep an eye on cost. You cannot run the business by focusing only on product,�� Diess told Reuters.“There are several examples where this has failed. Look at Borgward, they had by far the best products, but they disappeared,�� Diess said, referring to a company which made popular passenger cars in the 1950s. Borgward filed for bankruptcy in 1961 and was revived by Chinese investors in 2015.This week European auto leaders warned that a new emissions clampdown threatens jobs and profits after the European Union forced carmakers to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 37.5% between 2021 and 2030. This comes in addition to a 40% cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021.Frank Witter, the company’s chief financial officer said he wants to raise profitability to help shoulder the emissions clampdown by slimming down, rather than bulking up the car and truck maker.“Reducing complexity has its value in terms of the overall group structure,�� Witter said in an interview at the company’s headquarters in Wolfsburg.“In the past, strategy was reduced to 10 million retail sales and overtaking Toyota,�� Witter said. Last year, Volkswagen sold 6.2 million passenger cars.VW has begun dismantling Piech’s empire, selling some assets, including transmissions and bearings manufacturer Renk, MAN Energy Solutions, and listing trucks maker Traton earlier this year.Volkswagen is still reviewing its assets and products in its drive to increase profits, Witter told Reuters.“There are other things we certainly could think about, but I continue to refrain from speculation because that makes things more complicated.��	-0.6399882301
* All GM brands perform above industry average* GM finishes ahead of Japanese rivals Toyota, Honda* Toyota, Honda remain highly ranked* Porsche finishes in top spot on surveyBy Bernie WoodallDETROIT, June 19 (Reuters) - General Motors Co. vehicles won eight awards in the annual J.D. Power &amp; Associates survey of initial quality, a marked improvement since the largest American automaker turned itself around after a 2009 bankruptcy.GM cars and trucks won eight top prizes as the best vehicles in their segments of the U.S. auto market in the survey of new vehicle owners.Chevrolet, which accounts for 71 percent of General Motors�� U.S. sales, jumped 10 spots to No. 5 on J.D. Power’s initial quality ratings for 33 brands, the marketing information consultants said on Wednesday.David Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power, said GM has “done an outstanding job�� of working to change the long-held perception that its products were of inferior quality.“GM’s always been good at improving a vehicle once it’s come to market,�� Sargent said in an interview. “What they’re also showing to be pretty good at now is launching vehicles with pretty good quality too.”In the past, Sargent said, GM often introduced new products fraught with problems and then improved those models over time.The J.D. Power survey is in its 27th year. This was the first year that participants could fill out surveys online regarding their experiences in the first 90 days of new-vehicle ownership.The survey was conducted from February to May this year, and all of the vehicles in the survey were 2013 models.This year’s survey was updated to add more consumer feedback on the quality of new technologies, including navigation, lane-departure, telephone, information-entertainment and voice-activated systems.Sargent said that for the overall industry, quality slipped from last year, with the survey results showing more consumer dissatisfaction. That was largely due to expanded inclusion of new technologies in vehicles and consumers having difficulty using many of the new systems.But Sargent added that more complaints were linked to design-related issues rather than a defect or malfunction that could more easily be fixed by dealers than in years past.The best showing by brand, as measured in fewer reported problems per 100 vehicles, was Porsche, the German luxury sports car maker, followed by GM’s GMC marque, Toyota Motor Corp.’s luxury Lexus brand, Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti luxury brand and Chevrolet.GMC, which jumped 10 spots in the ratings, and Chevrolet were the top-rated non-luxury brands in the survey.The top 10 was rounded out by Honda Motor Co.’s luxury brand Acura, Toyota, Honda, Tata Motor’s luxury Jaguar brand, and Hyundai Motor Co..The industry average was 113 problems reported per 100 vehicles. All of GM’s brands, including Cadillac and Buick, performed better than the industry average.Non-luxury brands that scored better than the industry average were, in order of finish, GMC, Chevrolet, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia Motors Corp. and Chrysler Group LLC’s namesake brand, Chrysler. Chrysler Group is majority owned by Fiat SpA.Ford Motor Co.’s namesake brand remained in 27th place. Sargent said that while the automaker has improved on its touch-screen and voice-command controls, it has also offered its information-entertainment systems on more models, which opened it up for complaints.��(Ford’s) systems themselves are getting better,�� he said.Falling the most spots from a year ago were Nissan’s namesake brand, which dropped 14 places to 30th, and Chrysler’s Ram truck brand, which skidded 14 slots to 28th.Scoring the worst on the survey were the Fiat brand at 32nd and Toyota’s Scion brand at 33rd.Winners of some of the non-luxury best-in-segment awards were the Toyota Camry for midsize cars, Honda Civic for compact cars, Chevrolet Impala for large cars, Chevrolet Silverado for large pickup trucks, Honda CR-V for compact crossover vehicles, Nissan Murano for midsize crossover vehicles, and Chrysler Town &amp; Country for minivan.For more details on the study, go to www.jdpower.com/quality.	11.31043909

* Toyota unveils fuel-cell car to be sold in Japan, U.S. and Europe from 2015* Toyota’s hydrogen car to sell for about $70,000 in Japan* Japan government promises subsidies to cut vehicle prices, to promote infrastructure (Updates with Toyota announcement on fuel cell vehicle launch in paragraph 2)TOKYO, June 25 (Reuters) - Japan’s government and top carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp, are joining forces to bet big that they can speed up the arrival of the fuel cell era: a still costly and complex technology that uses hydrogen as fuel and could virtually end the problem of automotive pollution.Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, unveiled its first mass-market fuel-cell car on Wednesday, which is due to go on sale in Japan by end-March next year priced at around 7 million yen ($68,600). A U.S. and European launch will follow in the summer.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth strategy, announced the day before, also included a call for subsidies and tax breaks for buyers of fuel-cell vehicles, relaxed curbs on hydrogen fuel stations and other steps under a road map to promote hydrogen energy.That will bolster plans by Toyota and Honda Motor Co , Japan’s No.3, to start fuel-cell vehicle sales in 2015.“This is the start of a long challenge to make hydrogen a standard feature in society and to make the fuel-cell vehicle an ordinary automobile,�� Toyota Executive Vice-President Mitsuhisa Kato told a news conference.With two of Japan’s three biggest automakers going all in on fuel cells, the country’s long-term future as an automotive powerhouse could now hinge largely on the success of what they hope will be a key technology of the next few decades.The auto sector carries special significance in Japan, providing nearly one in 11 jobs and about one-fifth of its manufacturing output. It is also one of the few big industries where Japan remains at the pinnacle of global competition after losing much of its edge in electronics and elsewhere.Japan’s ruling party is pushing for ample subsidies and tax breaks for consumers to bring the cost of a fuel-cell car down to about $20,000 by 2025. The government is also aiming to create 100 hydrogen fuel stations by end-March 2016 in urban areas where the vehicles will be launched initially.“To stay globally competitive, Japan cannot afford to lag behind in this area,�� said Yuriko Koike, a former environment minister who heads a group of ruling party lawmakers advocating hydrogen energy.A fuel cell vehicle, running on electricity from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen, emits only water vapour and heat. Hydrogen fuel production from hydrocarbons emits some carbon dioxide, although Japan hopes to implement carbon-free production by 2040.Hydrogen vehicles can run five times longer than battery-operated electric cars, and their tanks can be filled in just a few minutes compared with recharging times from 30 minutes up to several hours for electric cars.The challenges for fuel cell cars nevertheless remain daunting and growth could be slow, especially given the expense of building up an infrastructure of hydrogen fuel stations and the likely reliance on subsidies until costs come down.“Even after 10 years, fuel cell cars are likely to be less than 10 percent of the Japanese market,�� said Ryuichiro Inoue, a professor at Tokyo City University and an expert in the auto industry.“This isn’t a strategy to talk about for the next 10 years, but for the next 20 to 30 years.”Even Toyota only expects tens of thousands of fuel-cell cars to be sold annually a decade from now as the new technology will need time to gain traction.The government’s commitment to hydrogen vehicles in its growth strategy, however, shows how far the technology has come since Toyota and Honda began leasing fuel cell-powered cars in Japan 12 years ago. Japan had set out bold predictions, later abandoned as unrealistic, of putting 5 million fuel cell cars on the road by 2020.Engineers have since overcome a variety of technological challenges, including cold-weather ignition glitches due to water freezing and the need to reduce loadings of platinum - the precious metal that fuel cells use as a catalyst.Rivals such as South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Daimler AG are also producing fuel-cell vehicles, but Japan believes it will have an advantage after the UN adopted many of its proposals for global fuel-cell safety standards last June. This means it can avoid major changes to fuel cell specifications for exports, keeping costs low.Toyota, which astounded rivals 17 years ago by developing the Prius hybrid car in barely two years and then swallowed initial losses to establish its dominance in the segment, is confident of its prospects in fuel cells.“When we first introduced the Prius, there was little way we could make a profit and our vision was longer-term, for the second- and third-generation models,�� Toyota managing officer Satoshi Ogiso told Reuters in March.“Unless you are willing to accept losses initially, it’s not possible to increase sales.�� ($1 = 102.0500 Japanese Yen) (Editing by Edmund Klamann and Rachel Armstrong)	2.490437739
YOKOHAMA, Japan, June 25 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said he was paid 988 million yen ($10.1 million) in the financial year that ended in March, little changed from the previous year and putting him among the highest-paid executives in Japan.The 0.1 percent increase in Ghosn’s annual compensation came after Japan’s second-biggest automaker saw its operating profit margin decline to 5.4 percent last financial year, lagging rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co.Ghosn’s compensation, which excludes stock options, is higher than that of his peers at other Japanese companies, who tend to have risen through the ranks over their careers.Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota, the world’s best-selling carmaker, was paid 184 million yen ($1.9 million) for the year ended in March.Ghosn, who is also CEO of Renault SA, has led Nissan since 2001.

* US NHTSA says BMW did not promptly report defects* Investigation found a number of violationsWASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - BMW North America will pay a $3 million fine to settle U.S. government allegations that it failed to promptly notify auto regulators about safety defects and recalls.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Friday that it found a number of disclosure violations related to 16 investigations of 2010 recalls affecting more than 338,000 passenger vehicles and motorcycles.The biggest recall, accounting for nearly two thirds of the total number of vehicles cited by NHTSA, involved certain BMW 5 and 6 Series cars from 2004-10 and 7 Series models from 2002-08. A potential oil leak in the brake vacuum pump heightened crash risk, regulators said.“NHTSA expects all manufacturers to address automotive safety issues quickly and in a forthright manner,�� NHTSA Administrator David Strickland said in a statement.BMW could not immediately be reached for comment.The BMW penalty was the largest since Toyota Motor Corp agreed to pay nearly $50 million in fines stemming from disclosure issues that included massive recalls in 2009 and 2010 for sudden acceleration.Since Toyota, U.S. auto regulators have become more aggressive in launching safety investigations and have gotten tougher with automakers about their recall practices.In many cases, NHTSA initiates defect investigations that sometimes lead to recalls based on consumer complaints or safety related incidents. In other cases, automakers find defects themselves or through other sources and take action without government involvement.Regardless, U.S. law gives manufacturers five business days to notify NHTSA of any defects in cars, trucks or motorcycles sold in the United States.NHTSA said BMW failed on multiple occasions to promptly report problems in certain motorcycle and vehicle models that led to recalls initiated by the company.In documents released by NHTSA, investigators noted a “troubling trend�� regarding BMW disclosure. They said the company provided little information initially about recalls and then dragged its feet when asked to follow up.Missing or incomplete information sought by U.S. regulators included plans by the company for addressing defects and details about the number of vehicles potentially affected.In addition to the pump problem in the 5, 6, and 7 series models, other cases involved insufficient windshield bonding in certain 2010 X5 and X6 sport activity vehicles. NHTSA also cited side lighting problems with certain 2010 X5 M SAVs and chain and brake problems in some motorcycles.BMW North America and its parent, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, agreed to address internal recall decision making to ensure that any future problems are reported to the U.S. government and consumers, NHTSA said.	4.904321379
(Adds comments from industry source, paragraphs 5-6)TOKYO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A Japanese government fund is considering a bailout of Renesas Electronics as part of a consortium including Toyota Motor Corp, countering a 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion)bid for the chip maker by private equity firm KKR, two sources said on Saturday.The taxpayer-funded Innovation Network Corp’s plan may include an offer of more than 150 billion yen in return for a controlling stake in Renesas, the two sources familiar with the discussion said on condition they not be identified.The offer may be delivered to Renesas’s shareholders, NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric Corp next month, the Nikkei business daily reported earlier. The group wants to acquire a majority stake in Renesas before the end of the year, the Nikkei said.A spokesman for Toyota declined to comment on the report. Renesas in a statement said it had not released the information.Being customers of Renesas, Toyota and other Japanese manufacturers might be persuaded to help the chip maker in order to secure their supply chains, an industry source told Reuters on condition he was not identified.KKR “just wants to break it up and make money. They don’t care about the supply chain,�� he said.Officials at the three owners, who asked not to be identified, said they were unaware of the bid. One source at a financial firm said the plan that counters KKR could take several months to devise.Joining Toyota and the government fund will be Panasonic Corp, Nissan Motor Co Honda Motor Co, Canon Inc, Fanuc Corp and auto parts makers Denso Corp and Keihin Corp, the Nikkei reported.The group may also invite German industrial group Bosch GmbH and other foreign firms to join it, the Nikkei added.KKR is also in talks to buy control of Renesas, which would be its largest investment in Japan, sources told Reuters last month. That deal would give KKR more than 50 percent of cash-strapped Renesas, and could speed the pace of its restructuring in the face of sinking prices and aggressive overseas rivals.Renesas, the world’s leading manufacturer of microcontroller chips used in cars, is laying off 12 percent of its workforce and plans to sell or consolidate half of its domestic plants.It would be among the top 10 biggest private equity investments into the world’s third largest economy. Run by cousins and private equity pioneers Henry Kravis and George Roberts, KKR has operated in Asia since 2006. Its only purchase in Japan to date is the 2010 acquisition of recruitment services company Intelligence from Usen Corp for $357 million.KKR’s bid is the second this year in Japan by a foreign private equity firm in a Japanese chipmaker, after China’s Hony Capital and U.S. buyout fund TPG Capital teamed up to bid for Elpida Memory Inc.Elpida, Japan’s last remaining player in the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market, is now in talks to be bought by U.S. rival Micron Technology Inc.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel 5406.T executives, including President Hiroya Kawasaki, will decide whether to resign to take responsibility for a cheating scandal after a report from independent investigators due by year-end, two sources told Reuters.The company also plans to release an internal report on the falsification of product specifications around Friday, said one of the sources, who has been briefed on the matter.The other source is a senior executive at Kobe Steel. Both requested anonymity because decisions on the future of the executives and a firm date for the release of the report have been not been finalised.Kobe Steel’s admission last month that workers had tampered with product specifications for at least a decade has sent global carmakers, airplane manufacturers and other companies racing to check whether the safety or performance of their products have been compromised.The company was ordered by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) last month to provide a detailed explanation of the data cheating and steps to prevent future abuses by around Nov. 12.It later appointed a team of outside investigators, who are due to report to management by the end of the year.“We received an instruction from METI on Oct. 12 to take steps to find the cause of the problem and craft preventive measures within a month and we are working toward that,�� a spokesman told Reuters by phone on Monday.“We can’t comment on whether we will announce this on the 10th and we can’t comment on the issue of management responsibility,�� the spokesman said.Kobe, which is now the subject of a U.S. Justice Department inquiry, has had a Japanese government-sanctioned seal of quality revoked on some of its products and lost customers.No safety issues have so far been identified from the data cheating, which mainly involves falsely certifying the strength and durability of products.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it had found no negative impact on vehicles that used Kobe Steel parts and materials, including copper tubing, aluminum extrusions and steel powder. The automaker, which earlier confirmed aluminum plates from Kobe Steel used in its cars were safe, said it was still making checks on other parts.Kobe has said it cannot yet fully state what impact the tampering will have on its finances. Last week, it pulled its forecast for its first annual profit in three years for the 12 months through next March.Its shares have fallen by about a fifth since it revealed the fabrication nearly a month ago. They rose 0.6 percent on Monday, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 index .N225 gained slightly.	-2.117328664
(Adds details on plants)TOKYO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it would resume operations at all domestic assembly plants by Thursday as a transmission plant in Hokkaido was poised to restart production following last week’s earthquake.A Toyota spokeswoman said partial production would resume on Tuesday at some plants including those near the company’s headquarters in Aichi Prefecture, and at subsidiary Toyota Auto Body Co operations on remaining lines would resume on Thursday.The automaker suspended production on Monday at 16 of its 18 domestic plants that manufacture the brand’s vehicles as it assessed the supply chain impact of a stoppage at a transmission plant in Hokkaido operated by Toyota Motor Hokkaido, which supplies Toyota assembly plants at home and abroad.Toyota said production at the Hokkaido plant would resume later on Monday, after operations were halted following last week’s 6.7 magnitude earthquake in Japan’s northernmost island that resulted in 44 deaths and hundreds of injuries.The Hokkaido plant produces transmissions for gasoline vehicles, transaxles for hybrid gasoline cars and other components, shipping components domestically as well as globally for use in popular models including the Corolla, the RAV4 SUV and Lexus NX and RX SUVs.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. on Tuesday suspended some of its car production operations in China after anti-Japan protests flared across China in response to a territorial row between Tokyo and Beijing.Beijing-based spokesman Hitoshi Yokoyama said in a text message sent to Reuters that the Japanese auto maker has decided to halt manufacturing and other operations, jointly run with its two Chinese partners, to “ensure employee safety.”He declined to elaborate and provide information on which plants are being affected by the move Tuesday. He did not say how long the suspension would last.Toyota and its partners manufacture automobiles in the southern China city of Guangzhou, the eastern city of Tianjin, as well as the northeastern city of Changchun.The company aims to sell 1 million cars in China this year, up from the nearly 900,000 cars it sold last year.The Toyota move follows a string of anti-Japan protests that have erupted in China over the last several days. Over the weekend, Toyota and other Japanese-brand outlets in Qingdao were torched by angry demonstrators.Hundreds of Japanese businesses and the country’s embassy suspended services in China on Tuesday, as anti-Japan protests threatened to reignite and drag a territorial dispute between Asia’s two biggest economies deeper into crisis.	-3.574060427

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday said it was planning to transfer some its parts manufacturing operations to its main supplier Denso Corp 6902.T to free up resources to compete more effectively on new vehicle technologies.Toyota said it would consolidate core electronics component operations of within Denso from late next year, adding that Denso would take over mass production of electronic parts used in its vehicles from 2022.Leveraging its “keiretsu�� tight-knit relationship with its group supplier, Toyota is shedding some of its in-house parts production as it looks beyond making conventional vehicles to develop new technologies including electric cars, self-driving vehicles, ride-sharing and other mobility services.Friday's announcement is the latest move by Toyota, which sells 10 million vehicles each year, to streamline its operations as it faces fierce competition from rivals including Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and also from technology companies such as Google GOOGL.O which are moving into the automotive space.Toyota said that consolidating development and mass production of components which control electric cars and automated driving functions would eliminate operational overlap, helping it to shift resources to new technologies.“By consolidating mass-production development and production of electronic components of both Toyota and Denso within Denso ... Toyota and Denso aim to establish a speedy and competitive development and production structure,�� Toyota said.Denso, which manufacturers components ranging from air conditioning systems to semiconductors, already counts Toyota as its biggest customer, accounting for nearly half of its annual sales. Toyota is Denso’s biggest shareholder, owning a 24 percent stake.“They’re basically pulling in all of the forces they need among the group companies to go electric. It’s reinforcing that they will be working very closely with Denso,�� Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities, said.“This move highlights the scope and scale of investment needed to develop all these new technologies.”Toyota and Denso’s relationship goes back to 1949, when Nippondenso was formed as a spin-off of Toyota. After years of supplying Toyota nearly exclusively, Denso has expanded its non-Toyota client base, particularly overseas.The two companies have also been setting up partnerships with other companies as they pool resources to contain the rising costs of developing new technologies.Toyota has teamed up with Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T to develop lower emission cars, while it is developing next-generation batteries for electric cars with Panasonic Corp 6752.T. Denso has formed alliances with electronics makers including Toshiba Corp 6502.T, while also scooping up tech start-ups. Also on Friday, Toyota said it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Toyota Tsusho Corp 8015.T, its trading arm, to consider transferring the automaker's sales and marketing operations for Africa to Toyota Tsusho from January 2019.	-4.728924635
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS said on Thursday it had invested in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab, as it seeks to expand into the region to reduce its reliance on China following a damaging diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing. Hyundai’s first direct investment in a ride-hailing firm gives it a “foothold�� in the world’s third-biggest ride-hailing market after China and the United States, it said.Singapore-based Grab, the biggest operator in the region’s third-party taxi hailing and private-vehicle hailing sector, has expanded to eight Southeast Asian countries.“The deal should help raise the exposure of Hyundai Motor in the region, while responding to the future mobility market,�� said Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at IBK Securities.Hyundai’s interest in Southeast Asia has grown since South Korean companies were targeted last year in a Chinese backlash over Seoul’s decision to deploy a U.S. missile defense system against Beijing’s objections.The region of about 500 million people is dominated by Japanese carmakers, while Hyundai has focused on China and the United States.Hyundai is also looking to catch up with its peers in future mobility, the personal transport innovations from ride-sharing to self-driving cars that are expected to reshape the auto industry.While it does offer car-sharing services in the United States and Europe, until now it has watched from the sidelines as competitors like GM GM.N and Toyota 7203.T have allied with ride-sharing partners.Hyundai and Grab said they would jointly develop services in Southeast Asia, including one utilizing Hyundai’s eco-friendly models such as the IONIQ Electric. They did not disclose the value of Hyundai’s investment.Hyundai last week announced for the first time a self-driving technology partnership with Silicon Valley start-up Aurora, a shift from its usual preference for developing technology itself.The Hyundai tie-up is part of Grab's latest financing round that raised $2.5 billion and included Chinese peer Didi Chuxing, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T and Toyota Tsusho 8015.T, a Grab spokeswoman said. Hyundai Motor vice chairman Chung Eui-sun said on Wednesday it is considering building a car plant in Southeast Asia, possibly in Indonesia or Vietnam.	1.351252648
TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - For three years, Akio Toyoda has had to steer Toyota Motor Corp through one crisis after another, from a damaging safety recall that took up to 10 million cars off the road to last year’s devastating earthquake and tsunami.Now, the 56-year-old grandson of the automaker’s founder is ready to go on the offensive.With Toyota’s U.S. dealerships humming again, Toyoda and his aides have sketched out a strategy in recent weeks aimed at stripping costs from everything - from production lines in Japan to Mississippi to the years of design and engineering that go into producing new vehicles and parts.The goal is to push up profit margins even as Toyota rides a wave of recovering demand while tapping into its tradition of incremental improvement - or “kaizen�� - the corporate creed that once made it the world’s most feared and studied manufacturing enterprise.At stake is Toyota’s ability to keep building some 3 million vehicles a year in Japan - roughly triple the equivalent output at Nissan Motor and Honda Motor and about 40 percent of the cars and trucks Toyota builds globally.The first down-payment on Toyota’s emerging plan comes on Wednesday with earnings for the just-ended fiscal year and its forecast for the current year.Senior executives pull no punches about both the scope of the challenge Toyota faces and how it lost its way when demand was booming. In the key markets of China, Brazil, Russia and India, “we’ve let Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor take the lead,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Atsushi Niimi said recently.In the United States, a market where Toyota’s reputation for quality with vehicles like the Camry was once unassailable, the Japanese firm is under pressure from both the rapid rise of South Korea’s Hyundai and the recovery of the Detroit automakers, Niimi said.And in Japan, Toyota is handcuffed by a strong yen, costly labour regulations, high corporate taxes and an energy policy deadlock that has shut down all Japan’s nuclear reactors, driven up costs and raised the prospect of summer blackouts.But the failure that stings most for Toyota executives was self-inflicted.When Toyota was racing to add factories to meet booming demand in the last decade, it stopped finding new ways to make the process better. “We hardly achieved any innovation in production engineering,�� said Niimi, noting a more flexible assembly line design promises to cut by 40 percent the time it takes to switch models on the floor.Skeptics believe Toyota will have to take more drastic action than turn around by a thousand cuts.“What we need to see now from Toyota is further cost cutting, a shift of production out of Japan so they can compete on prices,�� said Julie Boote, auto analyst at UK-based research firm Pelham Smithers.Importantly, although Toyota’s sales and production have come roaring back, analysts still expect it to trail both Nissan and Honda as well as overseas rivals in operating margin.Toyota is expected to forecast a more than quadrupling in operating profit for the year to next March, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That would put Toyota’s operating margin near 4.8 percent from an estimated 1.8 percent for the year just ended.While that would set Toyota within reach of its target of at least a 5 percent margin before 2015, it would fall short of Nissan’s 7.1 percent margin and 6.5 percent at Honda, the Japanese automaker that was slowest to recover from last year’s lost output, and lag well behind Hyundai’s 10 percent margins.To do better, Toyota executives say they have gone back to war against waste - or “muda�� - one of the key components of the automaker’s vaunted production system.At a factory tour in Toyota City last month, Toyota showed off some of those innovations, including an assembly line that can be more rapidly reconfigured during model changes. The technique, developed in Japan, has been adopted at the Mississippi plant that builds the Corolla and factories in India and Changchun, China.At the same time, Takeshi Uchiyamada, the Toyota executive vice president who heads engineering and research, wants to cut vehicle development costs by more than a fifth, in part by driving for a greater use of common parts.The use of shared parts across a range of models allows automakers to cut the procurement costs on items that customers don’t see or necessarily appreciate like the metal brackets that hold seats in place.While Toyota was once considered a benchmark of success in that area, rival automakers now look to follow VW’s progress in using a wide range of shared parts in both its luxury Audi and mass-market Volkswagen brands.The reforms at Toyota come with the automaker showing signs of new momentum in the United States market - still its largest and most important. Toyota’s U.S. sales jumped 12 percent in April - though that’s still close to a fifth below the same month in 2008 before the financial crisis triggered the car industry’s worst downturn in a generation.Christopher Richter, Tokyo-based auto analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, expects the recovery to pick up pace this year.“They’ve got a pretty aggressive product offensive coming up, and if you add what we’ve seen in their cost structure, we’re looking for a (big jump) in operating profits this year.��	-5.015518312
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s quarterly profit edged up as demand for its bread-and-butter car models from cost-conscious Chinese buyers helped offset bleak North American sales, although the firm’s shares slipped as it cut its annual net income outlook.Japan’s biggest automaker attributed the smaller forecast to unrealised losses from equity investments, but, in an indication that business was still strong, it kept its full-year operating profit view unchanged at 2.4 trillion yen ($22 billion).The automaker posted Asian sales of 464,000 units in the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, as strong demand in China for its cheap-and-cheerful Corolla and Levin sedans continued into the end of 2018.Popularity of its luxury Lexus brand also helped it buck a broader slowdown in the world’s biggest auto market.Toyota’s global sales rose 2.8 percent to 2.71 million units with Asia making up for the slack in North America, where its sales slid 7.5 percent to 680,000 units.“When one region is underperforming, other regions can compensate for that weakness. Likewise, when some vehicle models are underperforming, other models can compensate,�� Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama told reporters at a briefing.“It’s a work in process, but as we diversify our markets and our models, little by little we’re starting to see this happen.”Toyota shares dropped as much as 1.5 percent on Wednesday, but recovered slightly to end down 0.7 percent in a broader market that was mostly steady.(For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit, vehicle sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2Ro1enH)Toyota has been hit hard in the United States by slowing sales of its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and the Camry, as well as by its steep discounting to boost sales over the past two years as overall demand stagnates.In contrast, the Corolla, Levin and Camry were Toyota’s top three selling models in China in 2018, outselling larger ones like the RAV4 SUV crossover, as buyers reined in expenses amid an economic slowdown exacerbated by a Sino-U.S. trade war.(For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' vehicle sales in the U.S., China, see tmsnrt.rs/2RjnBuA)Toyota sold 1.47 million vehicles in China in 2018, up 14 percent, and aims to lift sales to 1.6 million this year, even as it and other automakers brace for another tough year there.Auto sales in China last year contracted for the first time since the 1990s, hurt by the phasing out of purchase tax cuts on smaller cars and the trade war. The world’s No.2 economy grew at its slowest in almost three decades in 2018, and the pace is expected to weaken further this year.But Japanese automakers, such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan, are expected to benefit from warming political ties between Tokyo and Beijing at a time when the Sino-U.S. trade war is weighing on rivals such as Ford.However, niche players such as Japan’s Mazda Motor have not been able to escape the broader China weakness.Mazda’s China sales sank 36 percent to 62,000 units in the third quarter, due partly to bleak sales of its Axela sedan that is priced slightly above than sold by many of its competitors.Mazda’s global sales fell 7 percent, but the lower-volume automaker still raised its annual earnings view as its quarterly operating profit dropped less than expected.(For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' annual global vehicle sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2RnFOr2)Toyota cut its full-year net profit forecast by about 19 percent to 1.87 trillion yen. It did not say which investments hit its net profit, but it is a major shareholder in Subaru, whose shares tumbled more than 30 percent in 2018, and Akebono Brake Industry, whose shares tanked 40 percent.Toyota booked an operating profit of 676.1 billion yen for the third quarter, slightly below the market’s average estimate of 680.8 billion, according to Refinitiv, but up 0.4 percent from a year earlier.($1 = 109.5700 yen)	-2.759190417
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, June 23 (Reuters) - In a country where owning a car has long been a symbol of luxury and success, around 85 percent of Chinese car buyers still buy cars with cash.But people like Chinese accountant Grace Mi and her peers in their 20s and 30s are changing the car financing game and are the ones catching the attention of global carmakers looking to boost revenue and defend margins in an increasingly competitive market.These young people are willing to buy big-ticket items like a car on credit - a behaviour unheard of some 15 years ago in China - and have led carmakers to boost their financing units in the mainland.The push by automakers to steer more people to buy on credit comes as part of their broader efforts to make up for sliding margins on new-car sales in China where more companies are cutting prices to entice buyers. Other key revenue sources include maintenance and repairs, vehicle leasing and sales of accessories and parts.Mi, a 27-year-old accountant in Beijing, did not have enough cash on hand to outright buy her dream car, a Nissan Sylphy, with a price tag of about 150,000 yuan ($24,200). Instead, she saved enough money for a down payment and took out a loan.“I didn’t want to take a penny from my retired parents,�� Mi said, adding that owning a car had become increasingly important for her personal and work life. “I didn’t have to wait for years to own a car.”Mi has been repaying 2,500 yuan, or one-fourth of her monthly wage, since November for her Sylphy. While the loan payments are not small, she says she doesn’t feel burdened.“Accountants are needed everywhere so I’m not worried about job security. I don’t think I am enslaved by the car loan.”Around 70 percent of car buyers in the United States and other developed countries take out loans, according to a Deloitte report in 2012 and the reason global carmakers are trying to seize on the rise in auto financing in China is because the sector is highly profitable.The financing unit of Ford Motor Co contributed nearly a quarter of the Deerborn, Michigan-based company’s overall profit last year while rival GM saw 12 percent of its profit come from its finance unit.“China’s car market remains primarily a cash market, but it is starting to move to credit,�� John Lawler, head of Ford’s operations in China, told Reuters in an interview. “It’s a demographic and generational phenomenon. Those people who finance cars are primarily younger buyers.”China’s central bank gave the sector a boost in early June when it cut the amount of money auto financing firms need to set aside as reserves in a bid to stimulate the economy which is showing signs of slowing.Global carmakers have been funding their financial units�� expansion by selling off their loans in the form of asset-backed securities to beef up their operations in China. That frees up money they can use to lend to Chinese consumers.So far this year, the financing units of Ford, BMW , Volkswagen AG, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp have each issued around 800 million yuan ($128.85 million) of asset-backed securities.The country’s automobile association forecast the auto financing industry to more than double to 525 billion yuan ($84.55 billion) by 2025.In an email to Reuters, GMAC-SAIC Automotive Finance Co Ltd, the financing joint venture of General Motors Co in China, said auto financing will be “integral in facilitating sales�� in the world’s biggest auto market.Bankers and analysts say the chances of car loan defaults are limited in China because the country requires a large down payment - 20 percent for new cars. Consumers here also have a higher savings rate compared with other countries like the United States.“It is viewed as a future source of income rather than a source of default and losses,�� said Patrick Steinemann, co-head of Asia Industrials Investment Banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.Indeed, GM’s China chief, Matt Tsien, said financing has proved a “steady business�� in China.“One of the characteristics in the Chinese market that’s very good for the financing business is that default rates tend to be very low,�� he told Reuters in Detroit. “So the risks are pretty good in that sense. People tend to pay up,�� Tsien said.Such a rapid expansion in auto financing does have risks, coming at a time when worries are mounting over the country’s corporate and government debt. These include the fact that, relatively, Chinese consumers have a short credit history.One executive at Toyota said the Japanese carmaker has encountered some fraud cases involving fake IDs that first appeared about a year ago in southern China and then began spreading to other parts of the country.Toyota uses a set of risk assessment tools modelled around those used in other countries and refined to local practices in China that are being used by global carmakers, two Toyota executives said. Both declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak the media.Toyota has further beefed up its loan assessment process and on occasions turn to the old-style approach of home visits, they added.“Home visits are still the most direct way of verifying customer addresses, but due to time and labour requirements we can only use it sparingly,�� one of the executives said.

* Bellwether Toyota offers no base pay hikes in FY2020* Wage hikes lose momentum as firms wary of profit squeeze* Tame wages hinder ‘Abenomics�� aim of sustained growthTOKYO, March 11 (Reuters) - Against the backdrop of the coronavirus epidemic and a looming global economic slowdown, big Japanese carmakers and electronics firms are tightening their belts in influential annual wage deals being hammered out with unions.Setting the tone, Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it had agreed to give workers an average monthly pay raise that’s 20% lower than last year’s hike. What’s more, the hike reflects factors like seniority - for the first time in seven years, base pay will not rise.The prospect of tame wage rises to shelter corporate profits will curb consumer spending and make Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s lofty goal of generating a self-sustaining growth cycle - a key plank of his ‘Abenomics�� policies to stimulate the world’s 3rd biggest economy - even more remote.Over the past six years, major firms raised wages more than 2% each spring as Abe heaped the pressure on businesses to boost pay to put an end to deflation and stagnation that has dogged Japan for two decades.BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said he would closely watch the outcome of the wage talks for a clue to gauge the price trend, as the central bank may expand monetary stimulus next week to counter the fallout from the spread of the coronavirus.“Substantial wage increases cannot be expected in 2020 as base pay won’t rise much,�� said Yoshiyuki Suimon, senor economist at Nomura Securities. He was referring to base pay hikes, which determine regular pay that accounts for most of monthly salary.Economists expect to see more wage deals like Toyota’s, with no base pay hike but an average increase of 8,600 yen ($82.15) per month more in the fiscal year starting April, compared with last year’s average 10,700 yen raise.Koya Miyamae, a senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities said: “Companies are turning cautious about base pay hikes as the new virus outbreak will exacerbate declines in profits.”�As the virus outbreak deepens, labour unions are also losing momentum towards base pay hikes, and both manufacturers and non-manufacturers become half-hearted about wage hikes.”With the economy already teetering on the brink of a recession, however, Japanese firms have become wary about wage hikes committing them to higher fixed costs.Companies have begun to take a varied approach, with more withholding blanket pay hikes and shifting to merit-based pay rather than seniority-oriented pay in an effort to attract young and skilled workers, while restraining wages for the middle-aged and elderly.Wage strategies have also been affecting by diversification in Japan’s work structure.About 40% of workers are now lower-paid part-time staff and contract workers - double the proportion seen in 1990, just before the Japan’s asset bubble burst, ushering in deflation.The growing army of low-paid workers has led unions to prioritise addressing the income gap between permanent employees and others, rather than broad uniform pay raises.

(Reuters) - Asian companies dominate the market for electric vehicle (EV) batteries and they are expanding their production capacity in Europe, China and the United States in a fight to win lucrative contracts from global automakers.Some carmakers worry, however, there won’t be enough batteries for all the EVs they plan to launch in the coming years and a bitter row between South Korea’s SK Innovation and LG Chem risks exacerbating the potential shortfall.Below are details of the world’s leading EV battery makers with details of their customers and expansion plans:China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's biggest EV battery maker, counts BMW BMWG.DE, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, Daimler DAIGn.DE - which makes Mercedes cars - Volvo, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T among its customers. The company emerged as a major force partly thanks to Beijing’s policy of only subsidizing vehicles equipped with Chinese batteries in the world’s biggest EV market. Beijing is phasing out EV subsidies next year.CATL, which operates factories in China, is building its first overseas plant in Germany and is considering a U.S. factory.PANASONIC CORP 6752.TJapan's Panasonic, a supplier of U.S. EV pioneer Tesla TSLA.O, said it has installed equipment to ramp up production at Tesla's Nevada plant to 35 GWh from its current production of around 30 GWh as of late October.

* Vehicle sales up 2.1 pct in Sept from a year earlier* Sales tax for smaller cars halved from Oct. to end 2016 (Recasts and adds dealer comments)BEIJING, Oct 13 (Reuters) - China vehicle sales climbed for the first time in six months in September, bolstering hopes that a tax cut for small cars which started this month will help breathe fresh life into the world’s largest auto market.The sales rise encouraged China’s main auto association to reiterate an earlier forecast of 3 percent growth for 2015, a marked change in tone from last month when it warned that slowing economic growth meant there was a chance of an annual sales decline.September sales gained 2.1 percent from a year earlier to 2 million vehicles, contributing to a 0.3 percent increase for the first nine months of 2015, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.Association chief Dong Yang said that while the reason for the September climb was not immediately apparent, he believed that government policies including a halving of the sales tax on cars with 1.6-litre engines or smaller to 5 percent would have a positive impact on the market.But a wave of discounting by General Motors, Volkswagen and others earlier this year failed to produce robust sales. Industry experts say the tax cut, a repeat of a similar policy move after the global economic crisis in 2008, is not likely to trigger a turnaround in the overall market.Auto dealers said showroom traffic for October so far showed the tax cut was having some impact but cautioned this could just be smaller cars accounting for greater proportion of sales rather than overall sales volume increasing.“Almost all cars selling in my store are below 1.6 litre,�� said Lan Zhijun, a sales manager at a Geely dealership in Shanxi province.Foot traffic is up 10 percent year-on-year, while sales are up 4 percent, Lan said. “Almost all customers coming in our store will ask about the policy.”Automobiles in the 1.6 litre and under category account for nearly 70 percent of total sales in China, and Volkswagen makes five of the 10 best-selling models in the segment.Shanghai Volkswagen, a joint venture between VW and SAIC Motor, said buyers would save 3,200 yuan to 9,100 yuan ($500-$1,440) on its various models eligible for the tax cut.A senior executive at Zhongsheng Group Holdings Ltd , one of China’s biggest dealer chains with nearly 200 outlets, said the tax cut has so far not affected overall sales at many of Zhongsheng’s retail outlets for Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and other brands.“At our Toyota outlets, we don’t really see much significant change or impact on overall volume,�� the dealer executive said, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.“People who planned to buy cars with 1.8-litre or 2-litre engines are now taking smaller engine models to take advantage of the new policy. That’s about the extent of impact we have seen so far.”The tax cut, which came into effect on Oct. 1, is set to run through to the end of 2016.($1 = 6.3323 Chinese yuan)	0.5451391757

YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan's 7201.T new chief executive said on Tuesday he would accept being fired if he fails to turn around Japan's second biggest automaker which is grappling with plunging sales in the aftermath of the scandal surrounding ex-chairman Carlos Ghosn. Makoto Uchida, who took over the top job in December, put his job on the line at a raucous shareholders�� meeting, where he faced demands ranging from cutting executive pay to offering a bounty to bring Ghosn back to Japan after he fled to Lebanon.Nissan’s worsening performance has heaped pressure on the 53-year-old Uchida, formerly Nissan’s China chief who became its third CEO since September, to come up with aggressive steps to revive the company.On Tuesday, Uchida, who faced repeated heckling by shareholders, said he was ready to face dismissal if he failed to improve profitability at the company, which is on course to post its worst annual operating profit in 11 years.“We will make sure that we steer the company in an effective way so that it is visible in the eyes of viewers. I will commit to this: if the circumstances remain uncertain you can fire me immediately,�� he said.Uchida did not give a timeframe for improving Nissan’s performance.The new boss must prove to the board he can accelerate cost-cutting and rebuild profits at the 86-year-old Japanese giant, and that he has the right strategy to repair its partnership with France's Renault RENA.PA, sources have told Reuters.Uchida pleaded for patience while he compiles a plan by May to recover from crumbling profits and a corporate shake-up following Ghosn’s arrest in Japan in late 2018 over financial misconduct charges.“If you can be patient a little bit longer, on a day-to-day basis you will be able to sense we are changing,�� he said.Angry shareholders questioned the ability of Uchida and other executives to lead Nissan’s recovery, and aired misgivings about issues including ex-CEO Hiroto Saikawa’s resignation, transparency into the company’s probe into Ghosn and the use of Toyota vehicles to transport board members.Attendance at the meeting to vote in new directors, including Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta, stood at 666 and was the lowest on records dating back to 2005.Before it began, some shareholders demanded more clarity about Uchida’s plan.“I just want to know what the plan for recovery is. At the moment, the share price has dropped again, and the value of the company has plummeted,�� said a 70-year-old former employee who owns shares in the company.“If this is the situation, part of me thinks that we would be better off with Ghosn ... If we don’t get a clearer vision of the path the company is taking, it will be a worry.”Nissan’s shares are trading around their lowest level in more than a decade following its latest earnings.Last week, it cut its dividend outlook to its lowest since the 2011 financial year, after dwindling car sales drove the company to post its first quarterly net loss in nearly a decade.	-15.17434352

* Companies reporting earnings include Toyota, Renesas and Isetan Mitsukoshi* Japan Display falls after loss forecastTOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose for a third day in volatile trade on Wednesday morning as the weak yen helped overall sentiment, while index-heavyweight SoftBank Group Corp soared on strong earnings.The Nikkei rose 0.1 percent to 16,574.06 in midmorning trade after rising as high as 16,814.64 earlier.The Nikkei’s gains have been trimmed as the yen strengthened against the dollar during Asian trade, with currency levels likely to dominate market direction, traders said.Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 0.1 percent, while both Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co were flat. The dollar climbed as far as 109.38 yen , pulling further away from an 18-month trough of 105.55 set last week. At 02:25 GMT, the dollar stood at 108.67 yen.With the market in peak earnings season, investors will be waiting for big companies like Toyota to announce their results later in the day. But as investors are prepared for profit declines the impact should be limited, traders say.“Since the yen’s rise has paused, the market seems to have turned around,�� said Masaru Hamasaki, head of market &amp; investment information department at Amundi Japan.He added that the market seems to have moved past guidance of profit declines. As long as the yen stayed on the weaker side, the Nikkei was expected to recover the 17,000 level soon.Other companies reporting results include Takata Corp , Renesas Electronic Corp, McDonald’s Holdings Company Japan and Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings.SoftBank soared 3.3 percent after it posted an operating profit of 999.5 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March, up 8.8 percent on the year.Sumitomo Heavy Industries soared more than 14 percent after it said net profit rose 36.1 percent to 33.13 billion yen for the year ended March.Japan Display Inc tumbled 4.2 percent after the Apple iPhone supplier forecast a net loss of 31.84 billion yen for the year ended March.The broader Topix dropped 0.1 percent to 1,334.41 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 fell 0.1 percent to 12,062.14.

* Nikkei, Topix at 13-mth high* Despite uncertainties, U.S.-China tariffs rollback hopes help* Toyota hits 4-yr high as cyclicals gain* Shiseido, Rakuten, Mercari down on earningsTOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s benchmark stock index rallied to a 13-month high on Friday on growing optimism for the economy, before paring part of those gains due to conflicting reports on how much progress has been made in U.S.-China trade negotiations.The Nikkei average was up 0.26% at 23,391.87, after climbing to as high as 23,591.09 - the highest point since Oct. 10 of last year. For the week, the index logged a 2.37% gain for its fifth consecutive weekly rise.The broader Topix advanced 0.27% to 1,702.77, its highest in more than a year, with trade turnover reaching 3.12 trillion yen ($28.6 billion), 47% above the average over the past three months.The Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday that the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases, which was confirmed by a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Although the plan appears to have met opposition from some advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump and there is no clarity on when and where the deal will be signed, investors have so far bet that a deal will come through in the end.“If you think corporate earnings will recover from here, you can expect further rise in share prices. Investors are now starting to expect such a scenario, which you can tell from the fact that cyclicals such as financials and energy shares are doing well,�� said Takuya Hozumi, global investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley.Carmakers and steelmakers rose 1.4%, and banks gained 0.9%.Toyota rose 2.2% to four-year highs, helped by its release of a share buyback plan and estimates-beating quarterly results.Terumo rose 13.4% to record highs after the medical equipment maker posted strong earnings in the three months to September.Isetan Mitsukoshi jumped 11.7% after the department store operator posted upbeat quarterly earnings and announced a share buyback.Kirin Holdings gained 9.6% after the beer and beverage maker announce a buy-back totalling up to 6.8% of its shares.On the other hand, Shiseido shed 8.3% after the cosmetics maker cut its outlook on poor sales in South Korea and Hong Kong.Rakuten dropped 4.5% as its quarterly operating profit was almost wiped out in the three months ended September as investment in its e-commerce and mobile units weighed on profits, with the value of its bet on ride-hailing firm Lyft also sliding.Mercari lost 18.9% after the internet shopping service operator’s earnings underwhelmed investors.

* Workers reached three-year wage deal on Sunday* Toyota, BMW see full production this week* Financial impact on automakers still unknownCAPE TOWN, Oct 7 (Reuters) - BMW said on Monday the labour situation in South Africa remained “inherently unstable�� and it had no plans to reverse a freeze on expansion, even after car parts makers ended a four-week strike.Car makers told Reuters they were hoping to return to full production later this week, after parts manufacturers agreed to a three-year wage deal with the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) on Sunday.The deal gave a breathing space to an industry that accounts for 6 percent of GDP.But prolonged labour turmoil has left some firms considering how much to invest in South Africa and BMW said last week it was no longer considering expanding production there because of the labour unrest.“The fact that the strike went on for four weeks is proof-perfect that the labour environment in South Africa in inherently unstable,�� BMW spokesman Guy Kilfoil told Reuters.“And that’s a perception - certainly in our parent company’s mind - that won’t change overnight, and certainly not by a strike ending that should have ended weeks ago,�� he added.NUMSA leaders have already dismissed BMW’s comments on freezing expansion as brinkmanship, saying the German car maker must seek the union’s approval before making any major changes to its operations.The car parts strike hit as the industry was recovering from three weeks of industrial action by more than 30,000 workers at major auto makers including BMW, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.Makers estimated that earlier strike cost them $2 billion in lost output while it was too early to estimate the impact of the latest action.“The extent and the duration of the industrial action this year has been the worst and longest on record,�� said the executive director of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers, Nico Vermeulen.Toyota Motor Corp lost production of 14,889 vehicles during the nearly two months of strikes, said spokesman Leo Kok.“We restart production with today’s night shift and hope to be up to full production later this week,�� he added.German automaker BMW aimed to be back to full production by Friday, after losing production of about 13,000 vehicles during the strikes, spokesman Kilfoil said.The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has protected the auto sector to provide relatively well-paying manufacturing jobs in a country where unemployment has been stuck at around 25 percent for years.But some car makers have long complained that wage hikes have not been met by higher productivity and labour relations are ranked as among the world’s worst in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report.Economists have said a long-standing governing alliance between the ANC and unions has led to labour-friendly legislation which has made the jobs market overly rigid and is eroding the country’s competitive edge.The central bank has been worried about the damage caused by labour strife that has slowed production in mines and factories, especially after South Africa’s trade shortfall unexpectedly widened to 19.05 billion rand ($1.90 billion) in August, the biggest gap in seven months.Workers at Anglo American Platinum, the world’s top platinum producer, have been on strike for more than a week in protest against planned job cuts the company says it needs to return its operations to profit.Amplats has said it is losing an average of 3,100 ounces of production a day from the strike. Gold producers and unions agreed to wage hikes of up to 8 percent last month, ending a three-day strike.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The problems for Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp 7312.T grew after U.S. safety regulators expanded a warning about faulty air bags to 6.1 million vehicles in the United States while two more lawsuits have been filed over accidents in older Honda cars.The news came a day after Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T recalled 247,000 vehicles in the United States because of potentially defective Takata air bags that can rupture and spray metal shrapnel at occupants. “The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) urges owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors vehicles to act immediately on recall notices to replace defective Takata air bags,�� the regulator said in a statement on Tuesday.“Over six million vehicles are involved in these recalls, which have occurred as far back as 18 months ago and as recently as Monday.”The previous NHTSA warning, issued on Monday, covered 4.74 million vehicles, and dragged Takata’s shares down 23 percent on Tuesday in Tokyo, the stock’s biggest-ever one-day drop.Its shares were initially up 7.5 percent early on Wednesday, but quickly fell back to trade flat, leaving them down 44 percent so far this year.In a statement released before the most recent NHTSA warning was issued, Takata said it would cooperate with U.S. authorities and automakers.Takata said the cost of repairs for the 4.74 million vehicles subject to the NHTSA’s earlier bulletin had been set aside, and that any additional costs would be minimal.The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said on Tuesday it was seeking information about the air bag defects from NHTSA and automobile manufacturers.Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, where some of the air bag incidents have occurred, wrote to NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman urging the agency to further expand the recalls.“NHTSA should ensure that owners of cars that are not registered in Florida, but spend a substantial portion of the year operating in the state of Florida are covered by the recall,�� Nelson wrote.He was referring to “snowbirds��, people who spend winters in Florida to escape the cold in the northern part of the United States.Cars produced by nine automakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MI Chrysler Group are affected by regional recalls that started in June. They began in certain high-humidity areas of the United States after the NHTSA started investigating reports of air bag explosions in Florida and Puerto Rico.The NHTSA is investigating whether Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.More than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled because of defective Takata air bags since 2008.The two accidents resulting in lawsuits against Honda and Takata both took place in Florida.A Honda spokesman declined to comment on both lawsuits because they are pending. A Takata spokesman referred questions to Honda.According to an accident report and lawsuit filed in July in a Florida state court, Corey Burdick, 26, was driving his 2001 Honda Civic in Eustis, Florida, on May 29 when he was involved in an accident with another vehicle.The accident report said an eye injury Burdick suffered was “possibly caused by the air bag deployment.�� The lawsuit, which is seeking damages above $15,000, said “shards of metal were propelled through the air bag’s fabric and struck Corey Burdick in the eye, resulting in disfigurement, impaired vision and other severe permanent injuries.”In the second accident, Stephanie Erdman, a then 28-year Texan stationed at a military base in Florida, was driving her 2002 Civic in Santa Rosa County when she was involved in an accident with another vehicle on Sept. 1, 2013, according to an accident report and lawsuit.The lawsuit described how “shards of metal, like shrapnel, were propelled toward Stephanie Erdman ... striking (her) in the face and right eye.�� It included a picture of her bloody face and the metal lodged in her eye.Erdman’s lawsuit, which is seeking more than $1 million in damages, was filed in May in Texas, where she bought the car.	8.03420326
TORONTO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s Competition watchdog said on Wednesday it has fined Japanese car and truck tire maker Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Co C$1.7 million for its alleged participation in an international bid-rigging conspiracy.The Competition Bureau said the bid-rigging conspiracy is tied to the supply of anti-vibration components to Toyota Motor Corp.The independent Canadian law enforcement agency that ensures businesses operate competitively said its investigation found that between June 2004 and August 2006, Toyo engaged in secret pacts with other suppliers of anti-vibration parts in response to requests for quotes issued by Toyota for certain Corolla, RAV 4 and Lexus models.Toyo Tire was not immediately reachable for comment.To date, the Bureau’s investigation involving motor vehicle components has resulted in some eight guilty pleas and over C$58 million in fines imposed by the courts since April 2013.The fine comes just a day after John Pecman, the head of the agency vowed that the Bureau would not go soft on cartel and bid-rigging cases, despite a couple of setbacks in some recent cases.Last month, Canadian prosecutors dropped proceedings against the local arm of Nestle in a multi-year investigation into alleged price-fixing of chocolate products.Canada had charged Nestle and others in 2013 with colluding to fix the price of chocolate. At the time, the Bureau recommended lenient treatment for the Canadian arm of Hershey Co, which cooperated with the investigation and reached a deal to plead guilty to a single count of price fixing.“Cracking down on cartels has been, and continues to be, a top priority for the Bureau,�� said Pecman in a speech at law firm Goodmans in Toronto on Tuesday.“We have had some setbacks. I won’t pretend otherwise. But a Chicken Little reaction that ��the sky is falling�� is a wholly inappropriate response,�� he said. (Reporting by Euan Rocha; Editing by David Gregorio)	-8.07110257
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp retained its rank as the world’s best-selling automaker last year, beating out rivals General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG for the second year in a row as the weak yen underpinned sales overseas.Toyota sales rose 2 percent in 2013 to 9.98 million vehicles, the company said in a statement on Thursday. With the weaker Japanese currency still helping it compete against global rivals, Toyota expects annual group sales to top 10 million vehicles for the first time this year.The 2014 target of 10.32 million vehicles, including sales from affiliated companies Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd, would represent growth of 4 percent from last year. The Toyota group plans to manufacture 10.43 million vehicles globally this year, up 3 percent year-on-year.GM sold 9.71 million vehicles last year, up 4 percent year-on-year, while Volkswagen said its sales rose around 5 percent to more than 9.7 million vehicles. The German automaker has pledged to surpass GM and Toyota to become the world’s largest automaker by 2018.Toyota regained the global sales crown in 2012, after slipping to third place behind GM and Volkswagen in 2011, following natural disasters in Japan and Thailand.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Toyota said it plans to invest 240 million pounds ($294 million) to upgrade its car plant in central England for future output, but retaining tariff-free access to EU markets after Brexit remained crucial.The company said it would also move to use more locally sourced components, an area carmakers in Britain are focusing on as a way to overcome currency fluctuations and potentially meet new local content rules which could come into force after Britain leaves the European Union.Toyota builds the Auris hatchback and the Avensis family car at the plant in Burnaston in Derbyshire. It said it would begin upgrading equipment and technology at the plant this year to allow it to build models on its new car-building platform, which can be used for different models and is being rolled out globally.“Our investment demonstrates that, as a company, we are doing all we can to raise the competitiveness of our Burnaston plant in Derbyshire,�� Chief Executive of Toyota Motor Europe Johan van Zyl said in a statement.The British government would contribute an additional 21 million pounds to the investment, the carmaker said.Toyota said last week that it could delay a decision on whether to build its next-generation Auris model in Britain to see the outcome of Brexit negotiations.The carmaker, which also operates an engine plant in North Wales, has invested over 2.5 billion pounds in Britain and employs over 3,000 people at its sites.Only 41 percent of the parts in British-built cars are made within the country on average, less than the typical 50 to 55 percent local content requirement which Britain would have to agree to in some bilateral trade deals.But van Zyl warned that it was important for the government to secure unfettered access to Europe for British-built car exports as part of a Brexit deal.“Continued tariff-and-barrier free market access between the UK and Europe that is predictable and uncomplicated will be vital for future success,�� he said.	-5.427323768
TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei pared early losses and turned higher on Thursday after the yen weakened, but gains were capped by dismal earnings from companies such as Toyota Motor Corp.The Nikkei share average gained 0.3 percent to 16,623.95 points by mid-afternoon, putting the benchmark index on course to post its four straight session of gains.“The yen’s weakness is lifting investor appetite,�� said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.Toyota fell 1.4 percent, but had tumbled as much as 4.5 percent earlier after it forecast a 40 percent decline in operating profit for the current fiscal year.By 0532 GMT, the dollar was up 0.5 percent to 108.90 yen .The broader Topix added 0.1 percent to 1,335.83 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 0.1 percent to 12,074.26.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will ease regulations to allow for self-driving cars to be tested on public roads from fiscal 2017 with the aim of companies providing the service for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.Abe’s decision, which came from a meeting with the head of Toyota Motor Corp and other executives, could be a boon for Japan’s auto sector as they catch up with Google in the development of self-driving cars.Promoting the technology could also spark innovation and capital expenditure, two elements that economists say are essential if Japan wants to break out of its decades-long cycle of bouncing in and out of recession.“Investment holds the key to higher productivity, and based on this investment we can take the lead in sparking the next industrial revolution,�� Abe said on Thursday.Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, all hope to bring a car to market around 2020 that the driver can switch to autopilot mode and want to use the Tokyo Olympics as a platform to unveil their cars of the future.This vision should become easier to realize now that Abe has come out in support of the plan, because this commits the government to scaling back Japan’s often onerous regulations, a government official told reporters.The government is not planning to offer subsidies related to the development of self-driving cars, the official said.Abe will also ease regulations to allow small drones to deliver packages in three years, which could encourage innovation in another field that Japan has lagged behind in recent years.Abe’s administration is trying to revive its economic agenda by focusing on ways to get companies to increase domestic capital expenditure.Increased business investment is important because this will increase productivity, create jobs and make it easier for wages to rise, economists say.	0.2322601313
TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp raised its operating profit forecast for the financial year by 9 percent to a record 2.4 trillion yen ($23.7 billion) as the yen, which has fallen against the dollar by some 9 percent this financial year, buoys profits of the export-oriented car maker.The world’s best-selling automaker said on Tuesday it now expects to post 2.4 trillion yen in annual operating profit, up from its previous forecast of 2.2 trillion yen and higher than its pre-Lehman crisis record of 2.27 trillion yen from six years ago.The revision was almost in line with the 2.44 trillion yen estimated by 23 analysts.For the October-December third quarter, Toyota posted 600.5 billion yen in operating profit, above the average estimate of 575.9 billion yen and nearly five times what it posted a year ago.	1.920170682
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will spend about 150 billion yen ($1.3 billion) to build two new car plants in Mexico and China, two people familiar with plans said, ending a three-year freeze imposed after unchecked growth lumbered the world's biggest auto maker with too many idle production lines.Reuters reported in January that plans were in place for new plants in the two countries, awaiting a green light from top management that has now been given. President Akio Toyoda had been cautious about expanding after Toyota was hit by a capacity glut following the global financial crisis.The new plants will raise Toyota’s annual production capacity by nearly 300,000 cars, the two people said - 200,000 in Mexico and up to 100,000 in China. They declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media, and said the expansion may be announced formally as early as this month.The renewed expansion drive by Toyota will put more pressure on rivals such as General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, in a global automotive industry still burdened by being able to make more cars than it can sell. The increase in global production capacity of up to 300,000 compares with sales of just over 10 million in 2014.Immediately after the financial crisis, big carmakers were cautious about adding production capacity. Now, with demand in the United States back at pre-crisis levels and China’s auto market growing, albeit more slowly, expansion is back on the agenda.A Toyota spokeswoman said nothing had been decided.The Mexican plant is likely to be based in the central state of Guanajuato, the two people said.It’s set to build the next-generation Corolla sedan for the North American market starting in 2019, they said, confirming a Reuters report last month. It would be Toyota’s first passenger car plant in Mexico, where it currently only has a small factory building less than 100,000 Tacoma pickup trucks a year.In China, the world’s biggest auto market, the new plant will be located in the city of Guangzhou. It will produce up to 100,000 Yaris subcompacts a year, starting in 2018, the people said.($1 = 119.7000 yen)	-0.4124004551

* New model’s fuel economy up 13 percent to 34 mpg* Sentra sales through July down 11 percent* Sentra No. 9 in compact sedan segmentAug 31 (Reuters) - When the Nissan Motor Co compact sedan Sentra rolls into U.S. showrooms in the fourth quarter, consumers may notice that it looks a lot like its bigger stable mate, the recently introduced Altima.Nissan is pinning expectations of increased Sentra sales for the all-new Sentra in part on the more aerodynamic design and resemblance to the better-selling Altima midsize sedan.“The 2013 Nissan Sentra is the most revolutionary design in the nameplate’s 30-year history,�� said Al Castignetti, vice president and general manager of the Nissan brand in North America.Nissan has eliminated 150 pounds and increased the small car’s aerodynamics to help boost its fuel economy to 39 miles per gallon on the highway and 30 mpg in city driving. Sentra’s combined fuel economy rating of 34 mpg is a 13-percent improvement over the current model.The 2013 Sentra will have a 1.8-liter engine, smaller than the current model’s 2-liter engine.Nissan’s compact Sentra has a long way to go if it is going to catch up with the leaders of the compact sedan segment of the U.S. auto industry.Through July, its sales put it ninth in the segment. No. 1 in the compact sedan segment is the Honda Motor Co Civic, with sales of 187,586, almost three times the Sentra.Sales of the Sentra are down 11 percent so far this year, at 65,872. This lackluster performance has allowed the Mazda Motor Corp Mazda 3 to overtake it, at 68,554 sold.Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds.com senior director of industry analysis, said that the Sentra once was among the top compact sedans on the market, but has been passed by better offerings from competitors.“The compact car market has grown in size and opportunity. More people are looking at it because there are better cars than there were before. The new Sentra is a chance for Nissan to take back its place among the more prominent compact cars,�� she said.Competition in the compact sedan segment is keen. The top five entrants all sold well over 100,000 vehicles through July. In order, behind the Honda Civic were the Toyota Motor Corp Corolla, the Ford Motor Co Focus, the General Motors Co Chevrolet Cruze, and the Hyundai Motor Co Elantra.And the Toyota hybrid entry, the Prius, which is the size of a compact sedan, has sold just over 100,000.Nissan has not announced pricing for the new Sentra.Brian Brockman, a company spokesman, said the 2013 Sentra’s prices will not change much from the current offering.The base model of the 2012 Sentra goes for $17,210, and the most-popular offering, the 2.0-liter SV, sells for $19,140. Those prices include destination charges.The Sentra is the third of five new vehicles that Nissan is introducing in the U.S. market in a 15-month period.Its top-selling vehicle, the Altima midsize sedan, recently rolled out to U.S. dealers and the Pathfinder crossover SUV will be available nationwide in the fall.Next year, Nissan will bring out replacements for the Rogue crossover and the Versa subcompact hatchback.With the new vehicles, Nissan hopes to increase its U.S. market share to 10 percent by 2016 or before, up from its current market share of 8 percent.Nissan is the No. 7 automaker in the U.S.	-2.108471993
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T will take small equity stakes in each other, the Japanese car makers said on Wednesday, as they seek to develop newer technologies and meet sweeping changes upending the global auto industry.The tie-up is the latest example of automakers chasing scale to manage costs and boost development. Car makers - especially smaller ones like Suzuki - are struggling to meet the breakneck growth of an industry transformed by the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), ride-hailing and autonomous driving.Toyota will pay around 96 billion yen ($910 million) for a 4.94% stake in Suzuki, while Suzuki will acquire in the market around 48 billion yen worth of shares in Toyota. That is equivalent to 0.2% of Toyota’s shares as of Wednesday’s closing price, before the announcement.The companies said in a joint statement they intended to overcome challenges facing the industry by “building and deepening cooperative relationships in new fields while continuing to be competitors��. They said they would strengthen technologies and products in which each of them specialize in.The firms had said in 2016 they were exploring a partnership, citing technological challenges and the need to keep up with industry consolidation. Earlier this year they said they would produce EVs and compact cars for each other.Automakers around the globe have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. Ford Motor Co F.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.Shares of Toyota and Suzuki closed little changed before the announcement.The deal brings Suzuki firmly into Toyota' orbit, alongside Daihatsu Motor Co, Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T, Subaru Corp 7270.T, Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Yamaha Motor Co 7272.T.Rival Nissan Motor Co 7201.T has an alliance with France's Renault RENA.PA, although that has been shaken following the ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, and with Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T.Honda Motor Co 7267.T has a tie-up with General Motors Co GM.N.Toyota has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for EV motors and power control units. It believes that move would help it cut by as much as half the outlays for expanded electric and hybrid vehicle components in the United States, China and Japan.Supplying rivals would greatly expand the scale of production for hardware.Suzuki, which specializes in affordable compact cars, had been struggling to keep pace with the huge costs of investing in research and development for automated driving functions.Toyota said in June it aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, and will tap Chinese battery makers to meet the accelerated shift to electricity-powered cars.	3.057471264
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp last month announced two deals in China that were small in size but large in strategic planning.The automaker said it would establish a green-tech research institute with Tsinghua University and provide state-owned BAIC Group’s Foton unit with fuel-cell technology for buses. But before it could feel comfortable unveiling those plans, Toyota put in months of work to pledge fresh investment - in the United States.The technology transfers represent gestures of goodwill to Beijing by the Japanese automaker, which wants to “step on the accelerator in China�� as CEO Akio Toyoda told an internal management group, according to minutes of meetings on March 19 and April 23 viewed by Reuters.Announcing U.S. investment first was a strategy Toyoda felt the company needed to pursue to avoid U.S. President Donald Trump’s wrath, the minutes showed - providing a rare window into how it has sought to tread carefully as the United States and China battle for investment, jobs and influence in the global economy.“For Toyota to operate globally, we need to strike a fine balance between China and the United States,�� the March 19 minutes quoted Toyoda as saying. “It’s imperative to avoid making enemies.”According to the April 23 minutes, the Japanese automaker is making what one unnamed senior executive described as a “significant move to steer its focus to China�� �� a market where it is far behind industry leaders Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co.Toyota declined to comment on its internal meetings.Its pivot to China - one that many other global automakers are also making - has been made easier by a thaw in ties between China and Japan but complicated by Trump’s trade policies.That includes the trade war between Washington and Beijing as well as threats from Trump to impose tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars made by foreign automakers. On Friday, Trump declared that some imported vehicles and parts pose a national security threat, although he delayed a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose tariffs.In response, Toyota issued one of its strongest messages on potential tariffs to date, calling the designation “a major set-back for American consumers, workers and the auto industry�� and saying it sent the message “our investments are not welcomed.”Toyota has been at pains to show its commitment to the United States, and in the March 19 minutes Toyoda explained a fresh investment of $749 million in U.S. manufacturing capacity and jobs as “an essential�� step before it could speed up efforts to expand in China.Announcing the new investment on March 14, Toyota stressed the sum helped bump up a five-year investment pledge made in 2017 to almost $13 billion from $10 billion. The day following the announcement, Toyoda also spoke before the Economic Club of Washington, declaring: “I love America��.“I just don’t understand why we are called a national security threat and it pains my heart,�� Toyoda said in answer to a question after his speech. “One thing I would promise, no matter what direction the discussion takes us is that Toyota will not leave America.”Though many other automakers, including U.S. automakers, have announced investments in the United States since Trump came to power in 2017, the near $13 billion pledged by Toyota is the biggest amount by far.Toyota would have pressed ahead with fresh U.S. investment even without its China plans, but there was much internal planning around how the announcements should be timed, company sources with knowledge of the matter said. The sources, who were not authorized to speak to media, declined to be identified.In a further sign of Toyota’s careful approach to relations with Washington, board member Ikuro Sugawara was dispatched in April to meet with U.S. Ambassador William Hagerty at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo to give him the heads up that the two China deals would be announced.“I didn’t think we needed to do that but the Ambassador commended our effort more than I had expected,�� the April 23 minutes quoted Sugawara, a former vice minister for trade, as saying.The U.S. embassy in Tokyo declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting, saying only it was in regular contact with Toyota and many other Japanese firms about their plans to continue investing in the United States.For many automakers, the U.S. auto market is a key profit center that generates industry-wide sales of about 17 million vehicles annually. But China has rapidly grown in importance - with 28 million vehicles sold in 2018 - and is drawing new investment from global automakers eager to keep up with its heavy promotion of electric cars.Toyota commands 14% of the U.S. market, but in China it had just 5.3% share last year and the 1.49 million vehicles it sold were less than half the volume sold by VW and GM.It is aiming to lift sales 10% every year over the next five or six years - roughly equivalent to 3 million cars annually by the mid-2020s, according to a source at a Toyota parts supplier, who declined to be identified as he did not work for the automaker.Asked about Toyota’s China ambitions, a company spokesman said China was an important market and the automaker was looking at strengthening its base there so that it could propel the business forward.China has sometimes been a difficult market for Japanese companies due to historical reasons, with sales in 2012 taking a battering in the wake of diplomatic spats over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan.But company sources say Toyota’s pivot has gained steam on the back of an official visit to Japan in May last year by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, during which Toyoda accompanied Li on a tour of Toyota’s facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido.Since then, Toyota has embarked on an expansion of its manufacturing muscle in China, with plans to add annual production capacity of 120,000 vehicles each at its Tianjin plant and at its Guangzhou plant.It is also expanding distribution networks and is sharing technology to promote goodwill among Chinese leaders, Toyota sources have said.“We have full backing of the Chinese government, but we shouldn’t take it for granted and must continue to make efforts consistently,�� the April 23 minutes quoted Toyoda as saying.In contrast to the automaker’s efforts in the United States, Toyota is content to keep a relatively low profile with regards to its plans in China. Neither the Tianjin nor the Guangzhou plans were formally announced by Toyota. Investment amounts have also not been disclosed.Last month a news conference for international media at the Shanghai auto show was canceled - a move that one company source said was the result of a warning by Toyoda to be circumspect when dealing with the media on the topics of tariff hikes or U.S. import quotas.(This story has been refiled to correct the spelling of Guangzhou in paragraph 25)	6.384778013
TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - Japan’s largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp, said on Friday that its global output fell 4.3 percent in June from a year earlier to 743,404 vehicles.Its January-June global production fell 3.5 percent from the same period a year ago to 4.46 million vehicles.The following are figures for domestic output, exports, overseas and global output of vehicles at Japan’s eight carmakers for June and January-June, with percentage changes from the year before.

* Engine factory to open in late 2015, follows new car plant* Toyota doubling auto production in Brazil* New factories based in Toyota’s Sao Paulo industrial hubBRASILIA, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Toyota said on Wednesday it will invest about 1 billion reais ($494 million) to build a new Brazilian engine factory supplying local car plants, bringing more of its supply chain to Brazil under government pressure.“With the local production of this engine, the national content of the Etios and Corolla will jump from 65 percent to 85 percent,�� Chief Executive Akio Toyoda told reporters during a visit to the Brazilian capital.“This is a sign of gratitude and greater cooperation with Brazilian society,�� he added.The investment comes as Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff shapes a new set of rules for the local auto industry, after imposing a steep tax increase on vehicles with significant foreign content to protect local jobs.Toyota executives were in Brazil for the inauguration of a new factory making Etios compact cars, built with an investment of $600 million. That plant is set to produce 70,000 vehicles per year, employing some 1,700 workers.The Etios factory, along with the new engine plant slated to open in the second half of 2015 and the factory currently making the larger Corolla, are clustered in an industrial corridor in Sao Paulo state.Toyoda said initial estimates for the new engine plant suggested it would employ around 600 to 700 workers at first and the workforce would grow as needed.	0.1593918588
BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - In a significant and potentially risky move in an Indian market that global automakers use as a test-bed for smaller, no-frills cars, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is betting on pricier premium models offering better safety and quality.The Japanese automaker has been in India for almost two decades, but has failed to displace rivals Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and Hyundai Motor 005380.KS, which together control around two-thirds of a market skewed towards cars costing less than $7,000.Now, Toyota aims to buck that trend by focussing on quality over quantity.Naomi Ishii, managing director of the firm’s India unit Toyota Kirloskar Motor, reckons providing dual air bags as standard features will sell core models such as the family-friendly Innova MPV and upmarket Fortuner sport utility vehicle - and help boost Toyota’s 5 percent share of the world’s sixth-largest auto market.“We don’t want to ... just introduce a price-competitive car,�� Ishii told Reuters in an interview at Toyota’s India headquarters in Bengaluru’s business district.“In case we introduce a smaller car, it should have very advanced features in safety, fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions. The price might be higher, but we can show this is the direction.”Ishii, 50, was brought in from Japan last year to head up the Indian operations and form a mid- to long-term strategy for the market. He is among the youngest managing directors, but has already clocked up decades of experience in global product strategy and pricing, and has been advising on Toyota’s future plans.As the India strategy takes shape, Toyota’s two new launches in the next three years will aim at the higher end, where wealthier middle-class Indians want safety and quality rather than just a brash sound system.People familiar with the company say Toyota will launch a compact utility vehicle and a sedan - most likely the Vios, to compete with Honda Motor's 7267.T popular City.Ishii declined to comment on the specific launches.Industry consultant IHS predicts Toyota could sell up to 30,000 of the sedans a year, and up to 50,000 of the compact utility vehicles.Toyota could be shifting its focus to the premium segment ahead of introducing its mini-car affiliate Daihatsu Motor 7262.T to India, said Kaushik Madhavan, automotive head at Frost &amp; Sullivan.“As a brand, Toyota’s not expected to play in the lower segment, but it could have an offering from a different name.”Toyota and Daihatsu dominate in Indonesia, another big emerging market. Ishii does not rule out working with Daihatsu to crack India’s lower-end car segment, but said there are no immediate plans.THE ‘TOYOTA WAY’A straight-shooter, according to employees, Ishii is reinforcing the ‘Toyota Way��, delegating more responsibility to staff, encouraging them to set targets, identify problems and provide solutions.Ishii sees most of Toyota’s existing product range in the premium segment, and doesn’t want to lose any of the company’s 1.1 million customers, who, he says, increasingly want more eco-friendly and technologically advanced cars.Some customers may want these features in smaller cars, and Toyota will address that in its future product planning for India, he added. But N. Raja, head of sales and marketing at Toyota Kirloskar, said the company will not launch a car priced below 500,000 rupees ($7,555).Maruti's top-seller, the Alto, starts at just 250,000 rupees, while Renault RENA.PA has launched its Kwid mini-car priced from 270,000 rupees. “REALLY HAVE TO MODERNISE”Toyota has struggled in India partly because it has been unable to make more of its parts locally, unlike Suzuki Motor 7269.T, which has reduced its costs and cut its prices.Toyota launched its first no-frills car, the Etios sedan, in 2010 and, a year later, the Liva hatchback. In trying to control costs and keep the price low, the company was criticised for compromising on quality and finish. Sales did not take off as expected, hurting plant utilisation levels.A wealthier population, and government plans to tighten safety and emissions rules should help Toyota, analysts say, though a shift upmarket is not without risk in a country where low wages mean no-frills cars make up some 60 percent of total sales.“Indian consumers perceive Toyota as a brand with quality, and that comes at a cost,�� said Puneet Gupta, senior associate at consultant IHS Automotive. “If Toyota is not in the mass segment ... the big risk is if the market starts growing at 15-20 percent, Toyota may not have the dealer network and supplier back-up that is required.”Ishii wants Toyota to double its Indian customer base by 2020 - suggesting it will need to sell 1 million cars over the next five years. By then, India is expected to be the world’s third-largest market with annual sales of 5 million cars.Toyota sold 141,347 vehicles in the year to end-March - a fraction of the 1.2 million sold by Maruti.Last fiscal year, Toyota turned a profit in India, ending three straight years of losses, and held on to its 5 percent market share.“The way I see the future of the Indian car market... is that we really have to modernise,�� Ishii said.	0.613447413
* Toyota says will not disclose timing, amount of share sale* Toyota invested $50 mln in Tesla before IPO in 2010* Follows Daimler’s sale of remaining Tesla shares this week (Updates with Toyota confirmation)TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it had sold some of its shares in Tesla Motors Inc but that it would continue to study possible cooperation with the U.S. electric car maker in the future.Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, invested $50 million in the Palo Alto-based startup in May 2010 ahead of Tesla’s initial public offering in June that year.Toyota said at the time the investment would give it a stake of about 2.5 percent, but the size of its current stake is not clear. Toyota said it would not disclose the timing or amount of the latest sale, which was first reported by the Nikkei business daily.“We will continue to have good relations with Tesla,�� Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said, adding that the sale resulted from Toyota’s regular review of its investments.Tesla’s shares were trading at $236 on Thursday, up from their IPO price of $17.Tesla has been supplying batteries and motors for Toyota’s RAV4 electric SUVs that went on sale in 2012, but that arrangement is set to end this year after Toyota sold just 2,000 of the vehicles.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company could sign a new deal with Toyota over the next two to three years.Daimler AG, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, said earlier this week it sold its remaining 4 percent stake in Tesla for a gain of $780 million. Daimler took a 9.1 percent stake in Tesla for around $50 million in May 2009. (Reporting by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan and Maki Shiraki; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)	6.069338922

KANSAS CITY, Kan. - Playoff driver Joey Logano bucked conventional wisdom with his pole-winning run in Friday’s knockout qualifying session for Sunday’s Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas Speedway (2:30 p.m. ET on NBC, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).The driver of the No. 22 Team Penske Ford was fourth fastest in the first round and third in the second round. In the final round, however, with the Busch Pole Award on the line, Logano ran the fastest lap of the day (191.646 mph) on tires that had already completed two hot laps.Logano wasn’t shocked that he could sustain that sort of speed in the money round. Far from it, actually.“Not surprising, for multiple reasons,�� Logano told the NASCAR Wire Service. “Sun was going down. It was getting colder. It definitely seems like, as the sun goes down, the track picks up grip. It had so much grip today. From Lap 1 (teammate Ryan) Blaney and I were laughing about it. It was like, ‘Oh my gosh, we’re going so fast.’�It’s definitely one of those race tracks that the more you go for it, the bigger the reward is. Also, the penalty is pretty big. We’ve seen that for a couple cars, too (notably Kyle Larson’s crash in opening practice). You get a little outside of it, and you are going for a ride, and it’s hard to regain control. It’s one of those places that the more risk you take the faster you go, but it is also more risk.”Just because Logano ran fastest on two-lap-old tires doesn’t mean there won’t be tire degradation in Sunday’s Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Round of 12 elimination event.“When the race starts, there will be some tire fall-off, for sure,�� Logano said. “This place has definitely worn into a really good race track, one that you can run the top as fast as you run the middle or the bottom for that case.“It puts on a good race. That’s probably what makes this one of the best repaves we’ve had. The fact that, when they redesigned the race track and paved it to make the top really come in, they did a really good job with that.”Fast, but not fast enough.That was the consistent refrain from Toyota drivers after qualifying.Led by Erik Jones, Joe Gibbs Racing drivers claimed the sixth through ninth spots on the grid. The No. 78 Camry of reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr. was too loose in the first two rounds and too tight in the final round after an adjustment went too far. He qualified 12th on the 1.5-mile track.On a positive note, all five of the Cup series�� top Toyotas made the top 12. On the other hand, they all qualified behind the five Fords that led the field. That defined the mission of the Camry drivers in Saturday’s two practice sessions: find more speed.“I think our Craftsman Toyota had pretty good speed, but just not quite enough to get the pole,�� Jones said. “We’ll keep working on it, but not a bad effort. We’ll start up here in the top six and go from there.”Seventh-place qualifier Kyle Busch, second in the series standings and likely a shoo-in to the Round of 8, hopes to make his task easier at Kansas than it felt during opening practice.“Feels like I have to push too hard to make lap time to what I need lap time to be,�� Busch said. “We’re struggling for free speed right now -- you have to earn it. You just have to figure out what your car is doing, figure out the balance and try to get as much speed as you can.“With the temperatures being cool, it’s just so fast -- just really, really, really fast. You’ve got to be all but perfect in order to have a fast car.”Denny Hamlin, who will start ninth behind teammate Daniel Suarez, echoed that sentiment.“Just a little bit slower than what we had hoped for,�� said Hamlin, who is looking for his first victory of the year after scoring at least one win in each of his previous 12 seasons. “Organizationally, we’re all kind of right there bunched together, and that’s what we had for speed.“Just have to make it a little bit better in race trim.”Busch and Jones accomplished that objective in Saturday’s first practice. Jones was second to Aric Almirola on the speed chart. Busch was fifth fastest but paced the field in consecutive 10-lap average.Jamie McMurray will join Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Kyle Larson at the back of the field for the start Sunday. McMurray blew his engine 19 minutes into Saturday’s early practice, forcing a change in engines and thus a drop to the rear to start the race. Larson, hoping to keep his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series title hopes alive with a victory, went to a backup car after the practice crash and consequently will start from the back ...Kurt Busch, last week’s Talladega pole winner, was back on top of the speed chart in Saturday’s final practice. His turn of 28.997 seconds (186.226 mph) edged that of Jones (186.104 mph) for the fastest lap in Happy Hour. Almirola, who paced Saturday’s first practice at 186.683 mph in cooler temperatures, was third in the final session, followed by Kyle Busch, Paul Menard and Blaney. Alex Bowman, who needs a victory on Sunday to advance to the Round of 8 in the Playoffs, was ninth fastest, with 184.919 mph as his best lap.--By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T set what it called an ambitious target to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles a year by the end of the decade under a plan to cut carbon emissions nearly to zero by 2050.Toyota, which is betting heavily on fuel-cell technology as carmakers rush to develop environmentally friendly vehicles, said on Wednesday it had so far sold 350 of its Mirai fuel-cell car, launched in December. It retained a target of boosting production to about 2,000 next year and 3,000 in 2017.Potentially the ultimate “green car��, fuel-cell vehicles run on electricity generated by mixing hydrogen fuel and oxygen in the air, without the carbon emissions produced by gasoline-engine vehicles.“When we first announced the Mirai, we said we were at the start of the age of hydrogen,�� senior managing officer Kiyotaka Ise told reporters.“The figure we’ve announced today is ambitious, but it needs to be to keep the ball rolling.”Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS is also producing fuel-cell vehicles for the consumer market and Honda Motor Corp 7267.T is widely expected to unveil its own offering later this month.The Mirai target compares with the 1.5 million hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles Toyota aims to be selling annually by 2020, up from 1.26 million in 2014.Toyota said that cars running on conventional engines will have virtually disappeared by 2050.Sales of the Mirai are limited to Japan but Toyota has been taking orders in the United States since August.A global rollout has been delayed due to a dearth of hydrogen fuel stations outside Japan. Supply of the hand-assembled vehicles is also still very tight, with roughly three a day produced at a single plant in Toyota City, the company’s sprawling headquarters in central Japan.Toyota added that it aimed to eliminate carbon emissions from its production facilities by 2050 by using renewable and hydrogen-based energy.	1.016243232
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co agreed to a $299.1 million so-called economic loss settlement covering at least 6 million U.S. vehicles with potentially faulty Takata air bag inflators, court documents filed in a federal court in Miami on Monday show.The settlement covers several forms of economic damages linked to the inflators, including claims that vehicles were inaccurately represented to be safe, and that buyers had overpaid for cars with defective or substandard air bags. Previously, six automakers to date have agreed to similar settlements collectively worth more than $1.2 billion including Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Subaru Corp and BMW AG.

(Reuters) - Rainy weather led to the postponement of the NASCAR Xfinity Series at South Carolina’s Darlington Raceway on Tuesday evening as organizers were forced to reschedule the event for daytime on Thursday.The 147-lap Toyota 200 was set to take place in front of empty grandstands due to the COVID-19 crisis but Mother Nature had other ideas as rain lashed the course.Race officials on Tuesday also moved up the start time of Wednesday’s NASCAR Cup Series Toyota 500 at Darlington by an hour-and-a-half due to forecast inclement weather.NASCAR was one of just a handful of sports that was able to return to action for the first time in two months last weekend.Kevin Harvick won the Real Heros 400 on Sunday to collect his 50th career victory in the Cup Series.NASCAR released a schedule last week that included 13 races between May 30 and June 21 with no fans in attendance.	6.651644133
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will cut production of its premium Lexus vehicle by about 20 percent as anti-Japan protests hit sales in China, the Nikkei reported.Toyota’s sales fell about 30 percent after some of its stores in China were damaged during violent demonstrations over Japan government’s acquisition of three islands in the East China Sea, the business daily said.Worries are simmering that the row could hurt economic ties between Japan and its largest trading partner. In 2011, their bilateral trade grew 14.3 percent to a record $345 billion.Toyota will lower production of Lexus models such as the ES, a sedan sold exclusively abroad, and the CT 200h, a compact hybrid vehicle, at a factory in Fukuoka Prefecture, reducing daily vehicle output to 1000 from 1300, the daily said.The factory, which sent 22 percent of its output from last year to Asia, may not meet its 350,000-unit production target for this year, the Nikkei said.However, the feud will not impact the production of other Japanese automakers such as Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T as they export fewer vehicles to China, the paper said.	-2.522365805
TOKYO, July 30 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is poised to overtake Toyota Motor Corp as the global leader in vehicle sales, with a rapid expansion drive in China - the world’s biggest auto market - while Toyota curbs growth to focus on shoring up quality.Toyota, reigning at the top spot in the auto industry for two years in a row, will announce its global sales for the first six months of the year on Wednesday, which could fall short of Volkswagen’s half-year total.The Volkswagen group sold 4.97 million vehicles in January-June, up 5.9 percent from the same period a year ago. That excludes figures from truck makers Scania and MAN, which will be released on July 31.IHS Automotive forecast Volkswagen’s total first-half sales at 5.07 million vehicles and Toyota’s at 4.83 million, although it added that Toyota could end up outperforming its projections in the Middle East and Africa.“China is the driving force of the global market, and the degree to which a company is focused on that region is linked to the global sales performance,�� said Yoshiaki Kawano, a Tokyo-based analyst at IHS Automotive.General Motors Co, which Toyota overtook two years ago, said it sold 4.92 million vehicles in January-June.For the full year, IHS expects Volkswagen to sell 9.91 million vehicles versus Toyota’s 9.47 million.Volkswagen, which sold 3.27 million vehicles in China last year, is planning to invest 18.2 billion euros ($24.4 billion) between 2014 and 2018 in new plants and products there together with its Chinese joint venture partners.Toyota’s China presence is much smaller with annual sales of 1 million vehicles, and while it plans eventually to double that it has given no time frame.Toyota has put a freeze on the building of new plants until about 2016 and President Akio Toyoda has stressed that the company is focused on building better cars rather than chasing sales volume.“Even if Toyota makes up its mind on potential investments soon, it’ll be around 2017 when those plants can start operating,�� said Takaki Nakanishi, auto analyst and CEO of Nakanishi Research Institute.Nakanishi expects Toyota to start announcing investment plans for new plants in the near future. It could open a new plant in Mexico, according to analysts and media reports.Despite VW’s expansion, profitability remains an issue, with its namesake brand’s 2013 profit margin at 2.9 percent while Toyota’s auto division achieved 8.8 percent and Hyundai Motor Co stood at 9 percent. Much of VW’s production is in its home market of Germany, where workers secured a significant pay increase last year.The Volkswagen group’s brands include Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche and Skoda, among others.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd (SMM) plans to focus on two key customers for its battery materials, Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp, supplier of car power packs to Tesla Inc, SMM’s new president said.While Toyota and Panasonic are already SMM’s biggest customers, rising sales of electric cars - led by Tesla’s mass-market Model 3 - mean the Japanese miner and smelter is in a sweet spot it needs to protect.SMM has spent 37 billion yen ($332 million) over the past four years to boost capacity of the nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode materials used in Panasonic’s lithium-ion battery that powers Tesla’s Model 3 and Model X.“Our cathode material plants are running at full capacity,�� Akira Nozaki, president of Sumitomo Metal Mining, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.The company’s monthly capacity of NCA cathode materials is due to reach 4,550 tonnes later this year, more than five times the monthly output of 850 tonnes in 2014, Nozaki said.Tesla formally launched the Model 3 electric sedans in July 2017, and has attracted deposits from more than 500,000 potential customers.After repeatedly pushing back internal targets, Tesla nearly hit its target of building 5,000 Model 3 per week for the first time in late June and “multiple times�� during July. It was targeting to produce 6,000 per week by late August.“We see Tesla’s production and sales have gotten into gear,�� Nozaki said.Asked about any further expansion of its capacity, Nozaki said any decision will depend on consultations with Panasonic.SMM, in which Toyota owns 3.8 percent stake, also supplies different types of cathode materials to batteries used in Toyota’s hybrid cars such as the Prius.Nozaki said his company will likely remain focused on its existing customers for now.“Battery materials are a custom-made product, not a commodity,�� he said. “We need to join hands with our customers to be able to respond changing needs for battery materials.”SMM, Japan’s biggest nickel smelter, aims to boost its annual nickel output through smelting to 150,000 tonnes by March 2022 from 90,000 tonnes in March 2018.It also plans to increase copper output from its equity holdings in mines to 300,000 tonnes from 260,000 tonnes, and gold output to 30 tonnes from 14 tonnes.SMM, together with nickel miner PT Vale Indonesia, are conducting a feasibility study on a nickel smelting project in Pomalaa, Southeast Sulawesi, using high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) technology in which SMM has expertise.If the smelter is given the go ahead, the Japanese company wants a majority stake in the project, Nozaki said.The strength of SMM, founded as a copper smelter in 1590, lies in its integrated production from raw nickel up to electronic components including battery materials, unlike global resource majors, who tend to focus on mining or smelting, Nozaki said.“Nickel smelters worldwide want to supply battery materials but they don’t know what quality of nickel products they should offer, but we clearly understand those needs thanks to our supply chain,�� he said.($1 = 111.4600 yen)	-5.43833824
NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of foreign companies rose on Thursday, led by Japanese exporters�� shares, which rallied on a weaker yen.The BNY Mellon index of leading American depositary receipts rose 0.2 percent, while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index rose 0.3 percent.The BNY Mellon index of leading Asian ADRs rose 0.5 percent.In Japan, the Nikkei share average climbed to a seven-month closing high above the 9,500 mark, as the yen remained weaker on persistent speculation that the central bank would adopt bolder action to pull Japan out of deflation under a likely new government.The Nikkei rose 0.8 percent to 9,545.16 points, the highest closing level since April 26.U.S.-traded shares of Toyota Motor rose 0.5 percent to $85.66.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T upgraded its full-year operating profit forecast by 8 percent on expectations of a weaker yen but flagged a dour outlook for North America, its biggest market, where quarterly sales fell to the lowest in nearly three years.Japan’s largest automaker is struggling to sell more cars in North America, where automakers are battling for customers with aggressive discounts, particularly on sedans as driver preferences shift to bigger SUVs and pick-up trucks. This has raised marketing costs for Toyota and other automakers.Profitable growth in North America is important to Toyota to help it sustain big investments it is planning to make in fast-growing new technologies such as automated driving functions and artificial intelligence.Toyota said on Tuesday it now expects full-year operating profit to come in at 2.0 trillion yen ($17.54 billion), up from a previous forecast of 1.85 trillion yen, based on a revised assumption that the yen will trade around 111 yen JPY= to the U.S. dollar, from 110 yen. The updated profit forecast number is more or less similar to last year’s operating profit of 1.99 trillion yen and in line with forecasts of a profit of 2.04 trillion from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Toyota Executive Vice President Osamu Nagata said that the improved forecast was largely due to a positive currency impact, adding that marketing activities, including financial incentives in the United States, would cut into overall profitability this year.“Weakening profitability in our U.S. operations is still having a negative impact,�� Nagata told reporters at an earnings conference, adding that the shift in demand from sedans to SUVs and falling residual values of leased vehicles would continue to weigh on the company.“We still have a lot of work to do there.”In July-September, the maker of the Prius gasoline hybrid and the RAV4 SUV crossover sold around 672,000 vehicles in North America, down from around 684,000 a year ago. It was Toyota’s lowest quarterly sales there since the January-March 2015 quarter.The automaker anticipates lower annual retail sales in the region for the year to March. At home, sales fell 4.2 percent during the quarter to 543,000 units.Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T, Japan's third-biggest automaker, and smaller Subaru Corp 7270.T both reported earlier this month that they sold fewer vehicles in North America during July-September and spent more on incentives to whittle down inventories.Nissan Motor 7201.T, the nation's second-biggest vehicle maker, will report its results on Wednesday. Toyota is fighting to stay competitive in the U.S. market, which is coming off a strong run that culminated in record sales of 17.55 million vehicles industry-wide in 2016. For the past year or so, Toyota has been raising the production of its Tacoma and Tundra pick-up trucks and its RAV4 SUV crossover, to capitalize on strong demand for larger models.But improving sales in other markets have been offsetting weakness in the United States. Quarterly vehicle sales rose 8.0 percent in Europe, and 0.3 percent in Asia. In growing markets, which include central and South America, sales rose 0.6 percent.“Even if sales in the U.S. have flattened out, they’re seeing growth in a lot of other markets, like ASEAN, Brazil and Russia, which were considered weak spots not so long ago,�� CLSA managing director Chris Richter said.Toyota posted a 10 percent rise in operating profit for the second quarter, exceeding analysts�� forecasts for 515.3 billion yen. It also announced a share buyback worth 250 billion yen, the latest in a series of buybacks it has been making over the past few years.($1 = 114.0000 yen)	-3.193158638
TOKYO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp will begin production at its new Mexico factory in January, the carmaker’s chief said on Wednesday, describing the plant as a key foreign base for the Japanese company as it pares its reliance on domestic output.“I just visited the Mexican plant and all preparations are complete,�� Mazda’s head, Masamichi Kogai said at a press conference at the Tokyo Motor Show. “This factory will become a crucial overseas base for Mazda,�� he added.Selling just over a million cars a year and with most of its vehicles built in high-cost Japan, Mazda has struggled to compete with bigger automakers that are 10 times its size. In the four years to March 2012, the company chalked up combined net losses of nearly 250 billion yen ($2.5 billion).Since losing the backing of Ford Motor Co, which once owned a third of the Hiroshima-based company, Mazda has drawn closer to Toyota Motor Co winning access to its hybrid technology. Mazda will also build cars for Toyota at the Mexico plant.	-5.791352638
Wallace wins Kroger 200 in tribute to ScottBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeMARTINSVILLE, Va. -- Driving a No. 34 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota painted and numbered as a tribute to NASCAR Hall of Fame nominee Wendell Scott -- with Scott’s family in attendance at Martinsville Speedway -- pole-sitter Darrell Wallace Jr. held off Timothy Peters to win the Kroger 200 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race Saturday.Last year at Martinsville, driving the No. 54 KBM Tundra, Wallace became the first African-American driver to win a race in one of NASCAR’s top three touring series since Scott accomplished the feat in what is now the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series on Dec. 1, 1963, at Speedway Park in Jacksonville, Fla.Though his number was changed to 34 on Saturday, in honor of Scott’s traditional car number, the result was the same for Wallace, who grabbed the lead from Johnny Sauter in heavy traffic on Lap 188 of 200, moments before the record 11th caution slowed the race.Wallace pulled away after a restart with six laps left and beat Peters to the finish line by .495 second. Peters bumped Sauter out of the way in the closing laps, also opening the door for reigning series champion Matt Crafton, who came home third and extended his series lead to 18 points over fifth-place finisher Ryan Blaney.“I wasn’t worried about anybody, honestly,�� Wallace said. “They kept telling me where everybody was, and I said I didn’t care. It’s our weekend and we’re going to come out and take this (grandfather) clock (trophy) home with us. And we just did that.“That was so fun. Martinsville is my favorite place to come to. Without the support of NASCAR and Toyota ... the whole Wendell Scott family is here and this is a special moment, just a perfect weekend for us. It’s a true honor to have Wendell Scott on our Toyota Tundra and to be able to put it in Victory Lane. I know he (Scott) just said up there, ‘Hell yeah.�� This is cool.”Wallace said he appreciated the win even more than his first victory in the series, at Martinsville a year ago.“It means a lot. I know I had a guardian angel looking over me this weekend,�� said Wallace, who took over third place in the series standings, 22 points behind Crafton. “To be able to put it in Victory Lane, you couldn’t ask for a better weekend. You thought last year was special, but this definitely beats it.”Upset with what he deemed roughhouse tactics from Peters, Sauter attempted to confront the runner-up on pit road after the race, but NASCAR officials and crew members kept the drivers apart.“It’s Martinsville,�� Peters said. “If you’re going to dish it out, you’re going to need to be able to take it. Did I mean to run into him? Yeah. I’m not going to deny that -- maybe not as hard.“But it is what it is. I don’t want to waste too much of my breath on that. We’ll just focus on how well we ran today.”Wallace led 97 of the 200 laps. Second was the pace car, which was out front for a record 71 laps during a race that featured more rookies than veterans and six drivers competing in the series for the first time.Erik Jones ran fourth, followed by Blaney, Tyler Reddick, Sauter, Matt Tifft (a UNC-Charlotte freshman making his first start), Alex Guenette and German Quiroga, whose ill-fated attempt to take the lead in heavy traffic on Lap 188 caused his No. 77 Toyota to spin and brought out the 11th caution, solidifying Wallace in the lead.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- Kroger 200Martinsville SpeedwayMartinsville, Va.1.

(Corrects second paragraph to say more than 7 million, not 6.5 million; corrects bullet point to say the same)* Takata says more vehicles could be recalled* Record-keeping errors at plant in Mexico* Honda, Nissan, Mazda check for problem* 7 mln cars with Takata airbags recalled since late 2008By Yoko KubotaTOKYO, June 11 (Reuters) - Japanese airbag maker Takata Corp’s safety crisis deepened on Wednesday after the world’s biggest carmaker Toyota Motor Corp recalled 650,000 more vehicles in Japan, and the supplier cautioned further fixes may be needed.The latest recall brought to more than 7 million the total number of cars equipped with Takata airbags to be called back worldwide over the last five years.Takata, the world’s No.2 manufacturer of auto safety equipment, said there could be more recalls from other automakers because of problems tracking potential defects with airbag inflators that date back over a decade.The Tokyo-based auto supplier said it had discovered record-keeping errors at a plant in Mexico where potentially faulty airbag inflators were made in 2001 and 2002.In 2013, carmakers including Toyota, Honda, Nissan Motor Co and BMW recalled about 3.6 million vehicles because of flaws in Takata airbag inflators that could cause them to explode in an accident.Takata did not disclose how much it expected Wednesday’s Toyota recall would cost. The company’s shares were down over 4 percent when the Tokyo market closed.Previously, Takata told U.S. safety regulators that it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of the explosive propellants used to inflate airbags.The company has also said it kept inadequate quality-control records which made it impossible to identify vehicles with potentially defective and dangerous airbag inflators.The Takata-related recall in 2013 was the largest airbag-related recall in history and came after a series of recalls, accidents and at least two deaths allegedly caused by faulty airbags.Toyota said it was expanding a recall it announced in April 2013 that involved 2.14 million vehicles manufactured between 2000 and 2004. The serial numbers Takata provided for potentially flawed inflators had been incomplete, Toyota said.In an unusual step, Toyota also said it would instruct its dealers in the United States and other overseas markets to begin replacing suspect Takata inflators on all of the vehicles covered by last year’s recall. Previously, the automaker had asked its dealers to inspect the airbags and only replace those that were judged to be defective.“We have judged that it is more certain to replace everything,�� Toyota spokesman Naoki Sumino said.Toyota’s expanded recall comes as rival General Motors Co faces scrutiny over why it took more than a decade to come to terms with ignition switch problems that resulted in at least 13 deaths.Honda, Nissan and Mazda also said they were investigating whether they needed to recall more vehicles due to problems tracking faulty Takata parts. BMW said it was not aware of any impact to its vehicles.In January, Takata began investigating whether there were other vehicles with potentially faulty inflators not covered by the previous recalls after being contacted by Toyota, company spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa said.Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the automaker had been notified of one case in which a defective front passenger-side airbag inflator caused a seat cover to burn and two cases where the inflator ruptured when the airbag deployed.Toyota vehicles covered by the recall include the Corolla and Camry sedans, and Tundra trucks.The inflators under investigation were manufactured between September 2001 and September 2002 at Takata’s Mexico plant, Takata said. Some of the explosive wafers used in the airbag inflator may have been exposed to excessive moisture or pressed into shape with too little force, it said.That could cause the inflator to explode when the airbag is deployed, potentially sending bits of shrapnel into the vehicle, the previous investigation found.It was not immediately clear how many Takata airbag inflators could have defects. Takata has notified other automakers besides Toyota about the issue, Hishikawa said. He declined to name those companies.Takata will be supplying the inflators that will be used as replacements in the Toyota recall, Hishikawa said.The Takata problems may benefit rivals like Sweden’s Autoliv , where executives have noticed an increased focus on quality among clients since its Japanese competitor’s first airbag recall last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will buy back up to 1.89 percent of its shares worth up to 360 billion yen ($3.5 billion) in what would be the automaker's biggest buyback in more than a decade.Toyota, expecting record profits for the financial year ending March 31, is returning cash to shareholders and boosting its return on equity after its cash pile expanded to 1.8 trillion yen as of end-December.The world’s biggest automaker said on Wednesday it would sell 30 million shares to Japan Trustee Services Bank for a token sum of 1 yen per share, with the dividends used to fund a new foundation to support the auto industry’s development and environmental protection.The remaining 30 million shares will be cancelled.“We want to reward our shareholders through this buyback and cancellation,�� Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said.Toyota, helped by a weaker yen that boosts the profitability of its exports, has forecast a record 1.9 trillion yen net profit for the year to end-March.The buyback is the first for the company in five years and its biggest since 2003, when it paid around 390 billion yen. It follows similar moves by several Japanese companies, including Canon Inc 7751.T, to boost return-on-equity, an indicator that is lower among Japanese corporations than the global average.Some analysts said Toyota should have invested the extra cash to expand sales and production.“At a time when it’s no longer special for the biggest car makers to sell around 10 million vehicles a year, we want to see how Toyota will make investments to take charge in the industry,�� said Satoru Takada, senior analyst at industry research firm TIW in Tokyo.Toyota and its group companies aim to sell 10.32 million vehicles in 2014, up 4 percent from last year. It has said it does not plan to build any new factories over the next two years after a rapid expansion prior to the 2008 financial crisis led to huge losses.The share buyback plan is subject to approval by an annual general shareholders�� meeting in June, the company said.The shares will be purchased after the shareholders�� meeting and no later than March 26, 2015. The stock closed up 1.1 percent on Tuesday at 5,621 yen, prior to the buyback announcement.	-4.041943001

(Adds final industry sales figures for October, paragraphs 3 and 5)DETROIT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry is on track for a record year of annual sales, General Motors Co said on Tuesday, as the top U.S. automaker and its rivals reported October sales that far exceeded expectations.GM said U.S. auto sales are on pace to end 2015 topping the 1999 record of 17.8 million vehicles sold.At a seasonally adjusted annualized rate, October sales were 18.24 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp, which is the highest October level since 2001, when automakers offered zero percent financing in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the company said.In 2009, at the depth of the Great Recession, U.S. auto sales dipped to 10.4 million vehicles.U.S. October auto industry sales rose 13.6 percent from a year ago. Analysts had forecasted October sales to be 8 to 12 percent higher than last year. A Reuters poll of 45 economists showed expectations of a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 17.7 million vehicles for last month.“October was a huge month for the industry, smashing expectations and continuing its hot streak,�� said Bill Fay, Toyota’s U.S. general manager.The booming October sales materialized despite concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending and stagnant wages.U.S. economic data suggests consumer spending lost momentum at the end of the third quarter, with consumption in September posting its smallest increase in eight months. Personal incomes also barely rose that month.GM said its sales rose 16 percent to 262,993 vehicles last month, marking its best October since 2004.Ford Motor Co, No. 2 in the U.S. auto market by sales, reported it sold 213,938 vehicles last month, a 13 percent rise from the same period last year. Ford’s U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said the company commanded record average selling prices for its vehicles, at $34,600 per vehicle.Volkswagen AG sales were essentially unchanged, well below the overall industry, as it feels the sting of a diesel emissions scandal. Volkswagen sold 30,400 vehicles in the United States last month.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported its 67th straight month of year-over-year gains, selling 195,545 vehicles in October, up 14.7 percent from a year earlier.Toyota Motor Corp said it sold 204,045 vehicles in October, up 13 percent.Honda Motor Co sales rose 9.3 percent to 131,651 vehicles.Nissan Motor Co said its U.S. sales rose 12.5 percent to 116,047 vehicles in October.	1.893816769
CHENGDU, China (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T aims to sell up to 1.8 million cars annually in China by 2015, up from about 900,000 cars it sold in the world's biggest auto market last year, a senior executive said on Thursday.Executive vice president Atsushi Niimi, speaking at an auto conference in the southwestern city of Chengdu, said the Japanese car maker’s target this year is to sell 1 million cars in China.Niimi’s comments come after the Japanese car maker posted a second consecutive monthly fall in China sales in August, which company spokesman Takanori Yokoi said was due to a high base from last year.That 1 million level this year should account for about 12 percent of Toyota’s anticipated overall global sales this year.The company wants to push that ratio to 15 percent by 2015, Niimi said. That should translate into China-market sales of 1.5 million to 1.8 million cars by 2015, he added.	-3.710159363
LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - BMW did not receive any reassurances from the British government over post-Brexit trading arrangements as it made the decision to build its electric Mini at its Oxford plant, a spokesman said on Tuesday.On Tuesday the German carmaker said its plant in Oxford, England has been chosen as the location to produce an electric Mini in 2019, confirming an earlier Reuters report.Earlier this month two sources told Reuters the British government helped to secure a 240-million pound ($314 million)investment from Toyota with a letter reassuring the Japanese carmaker over post-Brexit trading arrangements.“BMW neither sought nor received any assurances around post-Brexit trading arrangements nor any subsidies,�� a spokesman at BMW said, adding that no letter was received.Britain’s business minister Greg Clark welcomed the decision, saying it was a “vote of confidence�� in government efforts to make Britain a go-to place for the next generation of vehicles.

Dec 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s U.S. sales rose 17 percent in November from the previous year, to 161,695 new vehicles, the company said on Monday.Toyota reported its total auto sales figure on Monday morning and indicated it would issue more details of sales by brand and models later on Monday.	11.51777362
TOKYO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has scrapped plans for widespread sales of a new all-electric minicar, saying it had misread the market and the ability of still-emerging battery technology to meet consumer demands.Toyota, which had already taken a more conservative view of the market for battery-powered cars than rivals General Motors Co and Nissan Motor Co, said it would only sell about 100 battery-powered eQ vehicles in the United States and Japan in an extremely limited release.The automaker had announced plans to sell several thousand of the vehicles per year when it unveiled the eQ as an pure-electric variant of its iQ minicar in 2010.“Two years later, there are many difficulties,�� Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota’s vice chairman and the engineer who oversees vehicle development, told reporters on Monday.By dropping plans for a second electric vehicle in its line-up, Toyota cast more doubt on an alternative to the combustion engine that has been both lauded for its oil-saving potential and criticised for its heavy reliance on government subsidies in key markets like the United States.“The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society’s needs, whether it may be the distance the cars can run, or the costs, or how it takes a long time to charge,�� said, Uchiyamada, who spearheaded Toyota’s development of the Prius hybrid in the 1990s.Toyota said it was putting its emphasis on that technology, an area in which it is the established leader. Toyota said on Monday it expected to have 21 hybrid gas-electric models like the Prius in its line-up by 2015. Of that total, 14 of the new hybrids will be all-new, the automaker said.Toyota has previously said that it expects to have a hybrid variant available for every vehicle it sells. In a gas-electric hybrid like the Prius, a battery captures energy from the brakes to provide a supplement to the combustion engine, boosting overall mileage, particularly in stop-and-go city traffic.Pure electric vehicles, like the Nissan Leaf, carry only lithium-ion batteries. Consumer demand for the vehicles has been capped by their limited range and the relatively high cost of the powerful batteries they require.The decision to drop plans for more extensive rollout of its eQ city car leaves Toyota with just a single pure EV in its line-up. The automaker will launch an all-electric RAV4 model in the United States that was jointly developed with Tesla Motors .Toyota expects to sell 2,600 of the electric-powered sports utility vehicle over the next three years. By comparison, Toyota sold almost 37,000 Camry sedans in August alone in the United States, the automaker’s largest market.Toyota is also far from its plug-in hybrid sales target. The automaker planned to sell between 35,000 and 40,000 Prius plug-in hybrids in 2012 in Japan. So far it has sold only 8,400, or about 20 percent of its target.The plug-in Prius is designed with a battery that can be charged for just over 20 km (12.4 miles) of battery-powered driving. After that, the vehicle behaves like a more traditional hybrid and relies on its gas engine for extended range.“We believe that there is social demand for the plug-in hybrid, but our efforts to let the customers know what it is have not been enough,�� Uchiyamada said.A broad industry consensus sees plug-in cars accounting for only a single-digit percentage of total global sales over the next decade. Nissan remains more bullish, forecasting that by 2020 one-tenth of all cars sold will be electric.Globally, Nissan has sold about 38,000 Leaf electric cars since the vehicle’s launch at the end of 2010.U.S. President Barack Obama has set a goal of getting one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015, a target many analysts say will be impossible to achieve.	-2.522365805
DETROIT (Reuters) - German automaker BMW said on Wednesday it is recalling about 1.6 million cars worldwide to replace passenger-side front air bags made by Takata Corp because the inflators could break apart during deployment and injure passengers.The recall affects 3 Series vehicles produced between May 1999 and August 2006.While BMW is still taking part in a regional recall requested by U.S. safety regulators, BMW spokesman Dave Buchko said it decided to recall all of the model year 2000 through 2006 cars potentially affected by the issue. The regional recall requested in June by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covered both passenger- and driver-side front air bags.The recall is an extension of last year’s recall of 240,000 cars globally for the same issue. However, it overlaps with the regional recall. “As a precaution, we just feel now that the right thing to do is just to bring them all in and replace the passenger-side air bag,�� Buchko said. The air bags were supplied by Japan’s Takata, which has seen more than 12 million vehicles recalled over the past five years for related issues.Also affected by the regional recall were Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Fuji Heavy Industries -owned Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Chrysler brand.Subaru’s recall of almost 9,000 cars was national from the start, while Honda’s regional recall hit more states than NHTSA requested. Honda said there was no change to its position and its investigation was ongoing.Nissan said a decision for a broader recall has not been made yet and the number of cars affected in the designated regions was still being determined. Mitsubishi said there was no change in status as the issue was still being investigated.Mazda said it would decide whether to expand the regional campaign after its engineers evaluated the air bag inflators already recalled. A Toyota spokeswoman said the company has not expanded the recall.A Chrysler spokesman said the automaker is still investigating the issue, which potentially affects about 298,000 older vehicles in the four regions NHTSA designated.Ford said its position has not changed and it is cooperating with safety officials. It previously said the regional recall affected 58,669 vehicles.NHTSA said it was aware of BMW’s decision to expand its recall, but that was different from the regional recalls.BMW is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue. The cars previously recalled are not part of this campaign.In the latest recall, about 574,000 of the cars were sold in the United States, 450,000 in Germany and 189,000 in the United Kingdom. Last year, BMW recalled 42,000 cars in the United States for this issue.In addition, BMW said it has also recalled 26 Mini cars and one BMW i3 from model year 2014 to replace Takata passenger-side air bags. These are not part of the larger recall.	-0.9883426254
June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators said Friday they have opened separate investigations into consumer complaints about possible stability control failures in 2005 Honda Pilot crossover SUV and possible corrosion-related failures of rear suspension arms in Toyota RAV4 crossover SUVs from model years 2006-2008.This type of investigation is short of a recall of the vehicles, but may lead to one after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration completes its probe.The Pilot is made by Honda Motor Co and the Rav4 by Toyota Motor Corp.Pilot U.S. sales in 2012 were up 6 percent to about 45,000 and RAV4 sales were up 16 percent to about 74,000 through May, according to Autodata Corp.	4.960973674

(Reuters) - Chinese startup AutoX, backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, has applied to test self-driving vehicles without an in-car backup driver in California, the first challenger to Alphabet Inc’s autonomous driving venture Waymo to say it has done so.If granted the permit, AutoX would be able to test self-driving cars with a backup provided by a remote human operator rather than a driver in the vehicle, a step forward in the race to operate the first commercial driverless delivery vans or taxis in the state.Google-backed Waymo is the only company so far to have secured a full license for testing without a safety driver.AutoX, far smaller than Waymo in scale, is the first of a group of more than 60 companies that have tested with backup drivers in the state to say it is seeking permission for the next level of testing.“After three years of efforts, we believe that we have a technology that can go in deep, and safe for the public,�� AutoX Chief Operating Officer Jewel Li told Reuters, confirming it had applied for the permit.Waymo, General Motors Co unit Cruise and Uber’s troubled self-driving unit are among the U.S. tech companies vying for a breakthrough in a market in self-driving vehicles that is struggling to meet its early promise.AutoX, which counts China’s Dongfeng Motor Group along with Alibaba Group Holding Inc among its main investors, was founded in 2016 by former Princeton professor Jianxiong Xiao, a specialist in 3D learning, computer vision and robotics.The Hong-Kong-based company has raised $143 million so far in funding from investors, according to data provider Pitchbook, deploying 100 RoboTaxi vehicles in China while testing in 10 cities including Shenzhen, Shanghai and San Jose, California, where it has its second base.Its new application comes at a time when U.S. regulators have been clamping down on Chinese tech players looking to make inroads in the United States.Tesla Inc, Lyft Inc and Cruise are among the other players with permission from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to test self-driving vehicles in the state with backup drivers.AutoX, however, is one of only four firms holding a separate permit to test cars carrying passengers in the presence of a backup driver.The others are autonomous tech startup Zoox and Sequoia Capital backed Pony.ai, which has partnerships with Toyota Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co.Zoox and Pony.ai declined to say whether or not they had submitted applications to the Department of Motor Vehicles.	-1.442274032
BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said on Sunday it was setting up a research institute in Beijing in partnership with Tsinghua University to study car technology using hydrogen power and other green technologies that could ease environmental problems in China.The initiative, outlined by Toyota’s President and Chief Executive Akio Toyoda in a speech at Tsinghua University, is part of the Japanese carmaker’s efforts to share more technology with China as it seeks to expand its business in the country by beefing up manufacturing capacity and distribution channels, a source close to Toyota said.The Tsinghua-Toyota Joint Research Institute will conduct research into cars and new technology to solve environmental problems in China, including reducing traffic accidents, Toyota said in a statement.The institute will “cooperate in research not only related to cars for Chinese consumers, but also in research related to active utilization of hydrogen energy that can help solve China’s energy problems,�� the company said.The move dovetails with Toyota’s announcement this month that it would offer carmakers and suppliers around the world free access to nearly 24,000 patents for electric vehicle technologies.Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told Reuters earlier this month that the automaker intended to become a tier 2 supplier of hybrid systems and that it had already received enquiries from more than 50 companies.Later on Monday, Toyota said that it had started to supply fuel cell vehicle parts to Chinese commercial vehicle maker Foton and SinoHytec, without giving financial details of the deal.The company said in a statement that it hopes to cooperate with more companies in China to promote fuel cell vehicle penetration in China.	-5.509020619

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Big may be beautiful, but Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T global design chief is betting that edgy is the way to go for the Japanese automaker's premium Lexus brand, specifically its signature 'spindle grille' design.Tokuo Fukuichi, who is also Lexus�� global chief, says the design shock-therapy gives the brand - and conservative Toyota more broadly - the stand-out face it previously lacked.������ While some industry rivals and design experts say the jagged-edged, trapezoid grille is downright ugly, 63-year-old Fukuichi stands by the drastic makeover, saying it will give Lexus a ""unique"" edge over German rivals BMW BMWG.DE, Audi VOWG_p.DE and Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE particularly in competitive emerging markets such as China, where buyers will pay more for a car that stands out from the crowd.Fukuichi, who was brought back to Toyota from a subsidiary in 2011 and as he was recovering from cancer, says Toyota for too long designed cars by committee �� often of several dozen people. “The upshot was styling conservatism which everybody tolerated, but nobody was passionately in love with. We tried to please 10 out of 10 people. Now we’re trying to please one of 10 people out there with Lexus.”�When CEO Akio Toyoda asked me to come back, he told me he wanted to make our cars cool. That meant he thought our cars weren’t sexy,�� Fukuichi added, explaining his introduction back then of the head-turning grille.In an interview ahead of next week's Shanghai autoshow, Fukuichi said Lexus was still not at ""a gold medal winning level on the global stage,"" versus leading German brands and the likes of Jaguar TAMO.NS,��Maserati��FCHA.MI and Aston Martin.Fukuichi is no stranger to controversy. In the late-1980s, he caused a storm with Toyota’s first-generation Previa multi-purpose vehicle, which was dubbed the ‘egg van�� because of its quirky rounded styling.“Even polarizing designs, you get used to them after a while,�� he says.The designer’s credo is to take a risk to stand out from the competition - like a movie star playing on what others consider a flaw in his looks in an industry where the generic drop-dead fashion model doesn’t linger long in the memory.For Lexus, that flawed look is the spindle grille, which made its quiet, tentative debut in the Lexus CT in 2010 and was later incorporated into the redesigned Lexus GS.It upset more than a few. At a mid-2012 shareholders�� meeting, one angry Toyota shareholder complained the new Lexus “face�� was giving the brand a bad reputation. Even some Lexus insiders likened the new look to an ugly deep-sea creature.Others outside joined in the criticism. A former Rolls Royce designer said the pinched-in-the-middle spindle grille was a “design no-no�� as it created an “uncomfortable�� tension in the lines and shape of the car. A U.S. design professor said the controversial grille looked like the mouth of the Predator, an alien sci-fi movie character.But the radical look had its fans, too. A senior Nissan Motor Co 7201.T designer said the company's Infiniti premium brand quietly dropped plans to adopt a similar spindle grille profile because Lexus beat them to it.And the opinion that really counts - at showrooms - appears positive. Lexus�� global sales have grown 42 percent since 2010 to 583,000 vehicles last year.Fukuichi remains philosophical about his bold design.“I had nothing to lose except my life. I was ready to quit any time and retire if it didn’t work,�� he said."	0.5045772364
TOKYO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday said it was reissuing a recall for around 1.6 million cars in Japan to check for possible faulty airbag inflators.Toyota said it was asking owners of roughly 20 domestic models produced between 2004 and 2008, including the Vitz, to have their cars re-inspected for airbag defects, following an initial recall in May and June.This month, the world’s largest automaker by vehicle sales said it would stop using inflators containing ammonium nitrate manufactured by Takata Corp, which U.S. regulators believe can cause air bags to explode with excessive force, spraying shrapnel inside the vehicle.	0.4924915227
(Reuters) - A federal appeals court has halted an execution scheduled for Thursday of a man convicted of raping a woman and then killing her and her boyfriend with the help of a group of friends 13 years ago.The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled late on Wednesday to send Dexter Johnson’s case back to a federal district court after his attorneys argued the 31-year-old was intellectually disabled and previously lacked sufficient legal representation, according to court documents.Johnson was due to be executed by lethal injection at 6 p.m. local time at the state’s death chamber in the city of Huntsville.It was the second time that Johnson has received a stay ahead of his scheduled execution. In April, a federal judge also postponed his execution.A jury had found him guilty of robbery, kidnapping and murder and sentenced him to die in 2007, over the deaths of Maria Aparece and her boyfriend Huy Ngo.On June 18, 2006, Johnson was cruising around Houston with four friends looking for someone to rob when the group came upon Aparece and Ngo who were sitting in Aparece’s Toyota near her house, according to prosecutors.Johnson approached the vehicle with a shotgun and threatened to shoot the couple if they did not let him and two of his friends into her car. He then drove Aparece’s car around demanding money from the couple, court records said.With his other two friends following in their vehicle, Johnson found a wooded area where he stopped and raped Aparece. He and one of his friends then marched the couple into the woods and shot them in the head, court documents showed.After the killings, the group used a credit card they took from the couple at two separate Walmarts. The group was caught days later, after authorities found Aparece’s car, court papers said.Johnson’s accomplices were also convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Ashley Ervin is serving life while Keithron Fields is serving life without parole.At the time of their arrest, Houston police said they believed the group was also responsible for at least two other murders, along with a string of aggravated robberies and kidnappings.	5.551673267

(Adds Trump met with Abe)INDIANAPOLIS, Sept 27 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday an unnamed foreign leader told him at the United Nations last week that the country would soon announce plans to build or expand five automobile industry factories in the United States.“I just left the United Nations last week and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they are going to be announcing in the not too distant future five major factories in the United States, between increasing and new, five,�� Trump said in a speech on tax reform in Indianapolis. He added the factories were in the automotive industry.Trump did not name the country or its leader. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and 12 other leaders in New York at the U.N. General Assembly meeting last week, but did not meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel who was in Germany ahead of an election.Automakers in Japan and Germany have both announced investments in the United States this year, with companies coming under pressure from Trump’s bid to curb imports and hire more workers to build cars and trucks in the U.S.Investments to expand U.S. vehicle production capacity also reflect intensified competition for market share in the world’s most profitable vehicle market.In August, Toyota Motor Corp said it would build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant with Mazda Motor Corp.Toyota also said this week it was investing nearly $375 million in five U.S. manufacturing plants to support U.S. production of hybrid powertrains.Last week, German automaker Daimler AG said it would spend $1 billion to expand its Mercedes Benz operations near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to produce batteries and electric sport utility vehicles and create more than 600 jobs.Rival German luxury automaker BMW AG said in June it would expand its U.S. factory in South Carolina, adding 1,000 jobs.And last month, Volkswagen AG’s brand president Herbert Diess said the company expected to bring electric SUV production to the United States and could add production at its Tennessee plant.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Automakers in India want a temporary tax cut on cars, trucks and motorbikes as well as incentives to scrap old vehicles, to try to boost sales and generate revenue after the coronavirus outbreak has brought the economy to a standstill.Passenger vehicle sales in India fell 18% in the year to end-March 2020, their steepest recorded fall in years, after weak economic growth in the country over the last year. That has been compounded by a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an industry body whose members include domestic companies such as Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and Tata Motors TAMO.NS and local units of global car makers such as Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, said on Friday it has sought government aid.Companies want a temporary, 10% cut in tax on the sale of all automobiles and auto parts and incentives, in the form of tax rebates, for car owners to scrap their old vehicles, SIAM said in a media statement.It did not specify how long it meant by temporary.The automotive industry is the backbone of India’s manufacturing sector in terms of the employment it generates and its economic contribution.The coronavirus outbreak has left it in “deep distress��, making financial support and a revival of demand a necessity, SIAM President, Rajan Wadhera said.In common with other industries, auto manufacturing has ground to a halt and car showrooms have been shut since late March when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown to contain the virus�� spread. The lockdown has been extended until May 3 at least.The coronavirus is expected to delay the recovery of passenger vehicle sales, rating agency ICRA said in a note, adding that it expects sales to dealerships to decline by 10%-12% in the current fiscal year ending March 2021, after an 18% decline last year.Earlier on Friday, India’s central bank announced measures to discourage banks from parking idle funds with it and spur lending instead, to revive a flagging economy.	-1.840440391
TOKYO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Takata Corp said it expects a record net loss of 24 billion yen ($235 million) in the year to March 2015, hit by one of the biggest series of recalls in automotive history due to potentially explosive air bag inflators.The world’s second-biggest automotive safety parts maker also on Thursday posted a 38.65 billion yen net loss for the April-June quarter, reversing a 4.22 billion yen net profit from the same period a year ago.A full-year loss would be its second in three years, following a net loss of 21.1 billion yen for the year ended in March 2013.Nine automakers including Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp have recalled more than 12 million vehicles since November 2008 due to the risk that air bags made by Takata could explode.Car makers are also conducting separate regional recalls, known as “field actions��, in the United States to replace Takata air bag inflators. Honda said its regional recall involved around 3 million vehicles. (1 US dollar = 102.3100 Japanese yen) (Reporting by Yoko Kubota; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Stephen Coates)	-0.5485087419

BANGALORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T founder Masayoshi Son's dream of a global tech empire is unravelling, with the coronavirus crisis compounding losses at his $100 billion Vision Fund and distress at his big bets portending more pain.More than half of the fund’s capital is in startups that are suffering from the virus impact or exhibiting stress pre-dating the outbreak, a Reuters analysis showed. Ride-hailing usage at flagship transport investments has fallen more than 50% and six SoftBank-backed startups have pushed IPO plans from this year to next.The Japanese conglomerate has already flagged a 1.8 trillion yen ($17 billion) loss at the fund for the year to March - during which Son’s “intuitive�� bet WeWork spectacularly imploded - unsettling Middle Eastern backers which stumped up much of the fund’s money.Though many problems at portfolio firms pre-date the pandemic, the resulting economic meltdown has exposed what critics have long called an extraordinarily risky strategy of ploughing huge sums into unproven businesses in the expectation that would enable them to dominate big new markets.“The Vision Fund has been a mess. It has been a case of an organisation with too much money just splashing it around without doing enough due diligence,�� said Joe Bauernfreund, chief executive of SoftBank shareholder Asset Value Investors.Son transformed SoftBank into a tech investor over the past three years and raised the world’s biggest late-stage investment fund in the Vision Fund. To be sure, some investments are doing better, but examples are scant as the pandemic magnifies problems.The pain is particularly keen in transport and real estate, which make up $43 billion of investment and include car-share firm Getaround, home-seller OpenDoor and real estate brokerage Compass.Restrictions on movement worldwide has hit the market for the portfolio’s four major ride-hailing firms, with India’s Ola suspending operations in cities in Britain, Australia and New Zealand, three people with knowledge of the matter said.SoftBank and Ola declined to comment.U.S. peer Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N, whose stock is stuck 40% below its 2019 initial public offering (IPO) price, last month said it had sufficient cash reserves to weather the crisis. Southeast Asia's Grab said its food delivery business is doing well. China's Didi declined to comment. The fund does not include all $13 billion invested with SoftBank itself in office-share startup WeWork, or SoftBank’s bet on satellite operator OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month.Among SoftBank-backed startups, at least six that have pushed back IPO plans to 2021, including BigCommerce, which powers e-commerce sites for the likes of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Sony Corp 6758.T, said the three people, who were not authorised to speak with media so declined to be identified.Vision Fund bet DoorDash, a U.S. food delivery startup which earlier this year confidentially filed to go public, is also re-evaluating IPO plans given capital market volatility, a fourth person said.DoorDash declined to comment. BigCommerce did not respond to a request for comment.IPOs are a vital means of raising capital for the Vision Fund, with investors such as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala receiving dividends - an unusual arrangement for such a fund.PIF and Mubadala in recent weeks have expressed fresh concern about the fund’s performance and its ability to pay dividends, said two people directly aware of the conversations.“As partners with a long-term view, we have discussions with (SoftBank) on ways to best optimise the fund’s performance as we all navigate these difficult economic times,�� said a Mubadala spokesman.PIF declined to comment.Consumers housebound due to movement curbs has brought the portfolio some bright spots. For instance, use of short video app TikTok is growing, with Chinese operator Bytedance pledging to nearly double headcount by year-end.Orders have surged at South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang, and shares of China's Ping An Good Doctor - formally Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co Ltd 1833.HK - have doubled in price year-to-date on demand for online consultation.Overall, provided startups have enough cash to ride out the downturn, then recovery could follow, experts said.But bright spots are scant.Indian hotel startup Oyo exemplified Son’s approach of providing huge sums for rapid expansion before the business had proven it could make money. Movement curbs have since precipitated the collapse of the global travel industry.Oyo has backtracked on hotel revenue guarantees that are at the heart of its business model claiming force majeure, and is adjusting workforce and slowing expansion, the three people said.Oyo declined to comment.Chief Executive Son's investor credentials rest on an early bet on Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N. However, the billionaire has had a string of setbacks including bailing out WeWork after a failed attempt to float.Startups across the portfolio have struggled to demonstrate paths to profitability or have taken measures such as cutting staff as rapid, SoftBank cash-fuelled expansion came to an end.With the Vision Fund’s estimated losses, analysts said its investments are now likely valued below cost. Moreover, the troubles have left Son’s plans to raise a second mega-fund in tatters.Fund backers and SoftBank stakeholders including U.S. activist investor Elliott Management have called for a committee on the board to oversee Son’s big investments, the people said.“I don’t think the Vision Fund has worked out quite the way many anticipated,�� said venture partner Ben Narasin at New Enterprise Associates. “In some cases it’s an open question as to whether (SoftBank’s) bets made sense as laid. Others were spot on, but likely to be hindered by the new COVID realities.”The economic hit from the virus has far exceeded what the fund expected in the early days of the outbreak, a Vision Fund partner said on condition of anonymity.“In November, SoftBank indicated that about 15 of the Vision Fund companies would likely go bankrupt. Clearly the world has changed since November,�� said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chris Lane, who remains bullish on SoftBank stock. “It wouldn’t surprise me if ultimately about 30 of them go bankrupt.��	1.99704142
SOWETO, South Africa (Reuters) - Zakes Hadebe’s minibus taxi has nearly half a million kilometers on the clock, a broken speedometer and a fuel gauge he struggles to keep just above empty.Yet by 8 a.m. on a recent Friday, Hadebe and his rattling Toyota had already overcome rain, traffic and an ever-rising petrol price to ferry nearly 40 commuters from South Africa’s black township of Soweto to nearby Johannesburg.South Africa’s minibus taxi industry, scorned by other motorists for reckless driving and dogged by a reputation for violence, moves 15 million people every day, most of them lower income blacks. More like buses than the taxis of New York or London, the rumbling 16-seaters are the wheels of Africa’s largest economy.With an annual revenue estimated at $3.7 billion, the industry is also drawing attention from local finance firms and global automakers. Nissan this month started selling taxis in South Africa after an 18-year hiatus, looking to challenge Toyota’s dominance.“If the taxi industry were to stop completely, there’s no cleaner at your house, there’s no coffee at work, there’s no workers on the work floor,�� said Nkululeko Buthelezi, chief executive of the South African National Taxi Council industry body.The industry sprang up during white-minority rule, when blacks had to live in townships miles away from the cities where they worked and where bus service was spotty.Since the end of apartheid in 1994, taxis have grown into arguably South Africa’s largest black-owned sector, with around 250,000 vehicles and directly employing 600,000.While the average owner has 2-1/2 vehicles and employs drivers, some, like Hadebe, do the driving themselves.“The petrol is the biggest problem,�� said the 33-year-old, whose daily revenue is at the bottom end of the industry average of 1,000 to 2,500 rand ($93-$230), and that’s before paying for fuel.“You have to make use of each and every cent that you get.”The sound and spectacle of the often battered and barely roadworthy taxis are impossible to miss; drivers persistently bleat their horns to attract passengers, who use an elaborate system of hand signals to indicate destinations.A single finger pointing up will flag a taxi headed into central Johannesburg, while four fingers indicate the suburb of Fourways. The city of Johannesburg has even published a guide to hand signals.Drivers stop for passengers without warning, and their recklessness, combined with shoddy maintenance, make for deadly road accidents. In 2010 police arrested a man who was driving drunk with 49 children in a taxi meant for 16.The national taxi council last year started an academy for customer care and driving skills. It also aims to formalize hiring by registering drivers and promoting a code of conduct.To improve road safety, the government offers owners a subsidy to scrap old taxis and buy new ones, but uptake is slow as the grant covers just a fifth of the cost of a new Toyota.The industry has yet to stamp out the mafia-style violence that flares up when rival owners battle for routes. Last month the chairman of one Johannesburg taxi group was gunned down in what police said was probably a planned execution.Taxi violence claimed at least 140 lives in 2011, according to one study, down from 258 in 1999, when townships were scorched by waves of “taxi wars��.Still, that’s enough to rival the deadly political infighting of South Africa’s mining industry.Buthelezi said the taxi council had brought down violence, but admitted more needed to be done. A “huge percentage�� of drivers still carry guns, he said.“It has been a violent industry, so people develop certain protection mechanisms.”The industry’s wider economic impact is in plain view on a visit to one of the thousands of bustling taxi ranks that dot cities and townships across the country, where commuters queue for a lift or to transfer between routes.Besides those employed at the ranks, such as queue organizers, scores more flock to it to make their living. There are women serving meals by the roadside, hawkers selling drinks and clothing, and makeshift barbers offering a “cheese kop��, or head shave.Though taxis are better regulated than during apartheid, finance remains a major hurdle for owners.“Most of the people who come to us cannot access funding from the traditional institutions,�� said Terry Kier, the chief executive of SA Taxi, the taxi financing unit of Johannesburg-listed Transaction Capital.“They are very astute businessmen. They’ve got very deep insight into their cash flows.”SA Taxi finances 23,000 vehicles, all of which are equipped with tracking devices, giving it data into the profitability of routes and individual owners. That helps it build a better profile of the business than a simple credit history of the owner, Kier said.The company uses the data to sell localized advertising space in taxis; the opening of a shop, for example, can be advertised on routes in the immediate area.Around 1,200 new taxis are sold every month in South Africa, about 80 percent of them Toyotas.Nissan, a major player until a regulatory change in 1996 prompted it to abandon the market, is aiming to sell up to 400 a month of its new NV350. The NV350 starts at 307,000 rand ($28,600), just under the 312,100 rand for Toyota’s Quantum.So far Toyota has been able to fend off rivals. Chinese automakers tried to muscle in, but their low-priced vehicles haven’t been able to take the punishment, owners say.Toyota also has a long track record with the industry, helping it win legal recognition from the apartheid government in the 1980s, which sought to keep blacks from driving cabs.An early Toyota taxi model was known as a “Zola Budd�� in the townships, said Johan van Zyl, Toyota’s head for Africa, after the 1980s South African distance runner famous for her speed and endurance.Taxi owners have a similar resilience.“It’s a bunch of people who had to struggle to establish an industry by themselves,�� van Zyl said. “They financed themselves, they created their own industry and their own rules and regulations.��($1 = 10.7042 South African rand)	-8.06508981

MUMBAI, Dec 1 (Reuters) - India’s Maruti Suzuki Ltd said on Thursday monthly domestic sales rose about 14.2 percent year-over-year in November, and rose 2.1 percent month-over-month.Indian auto makers are generally expected to report weaker transactions for November as a severe cash crunch impacts the country, hitting retail sales.Maruti Suzuki, the country’s biggest auto maker, said total domestic sales rose to 126,325 vehicles from 110,599 in the same month last year.It had clocked sales of 123,764 vehicles in October.Other automakers will report November sales numbers later on Thursday and in the coming days.Automobile dealers around the country have reported seeing a sharp fall in sales after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise move to ban 500 and 1,000 rupee denominated notes last month, which accounted for 86 percent of currency in circulation.The move has sparked concern it will dent growth in India’s consumer demand-reliant economy at a time when gross domestic product had expanded at an annual 7.3 percent between July and September, the fastest rate for a large economy.Analysts say sales of two-wheelers are likely to be impacted the most since around 40 percent of transactions are financed by cash, according to Credit Suisse estimates.Cars, especially more premium ones, are mainly financed with non-cash, but nonetheless are still expected to suffer from reduced sales because of weak consumer sentiment, though analysts hope sales will start recovering after two quarters when the cash crunch subsides.“Our discussion with dealers suggests that customers are delaying bookings rather than cancelling them at this juncture, which could be due to liquidity shortage affecting small businesses and poor customer sentiment,�� Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note.On the ground, dealers back up that premise.In Guwahati, the largest city in India’s remote northeast, a Toyota showroom that only a few weeks ago was bustling with customers looked desolate during a visit this week as young sales executives impatiently waited for the next customer.“Earlier we sold anything between 60 to 70 vehicles a month, but post-demonetization the sales have come down drastically by more than 50 percent,�� Dip Bayan, senior sales manager of Gargya Autocity Pvt Ltd, the largest Toyota dealer in the northeast, told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Europe’s largest automaker, is expanding its cloud-based software and data portal, aiming to develop it into an industry-wide marketplace where business customers can buy and sell industrial applications, the company said on Thursday.VW’s “industrial cloud�� was designed in partnership with Amazon Web Services and eventually will link more than 120 VW factories around the world to the automaker’s 1,500 suppliers and their 30,000 plants.The portal is intended as a place to exchange data and software to help accelerate the digitalization of factory processes from stamping to painting to machinery maintenance, according to Nihar Patel, VW’s executive vice president for strategic core projects.VW has opened the portal to the first group of supplier partners, led by Siemens AG. Those partners are expected to contribute software applications to be shared with VW and among themselves, in what the automaker described as “an App Store approach.”Among the initial wave of supplier partners are ABB [ABB.UL], the Swiss industrial automation specialist, and Dürr, the German supplier of automated paint systems and plant engineering services.AWS will help manage the portal and will provide a range of cloud-based support services, including data analytics and computing, according to Dirk Didascalou, vice president of the Internet of Things at AWS.VW, the world’s third largest automaker by market capitalization behind Tesla Inc and Toyota Motor Corp, has been working on the industrial cloud for several years with AWS, one of Amazon’s fastest-growing, highest-margin businesses and one that works mainly with corporate customers, from BMW AGand Toyota to Avis Budget Group and Formula One, to manage, analyze and in some cases monetize data.Patel said VW’s efforts to speed up the ongoing digitalization of its factories has the support of the company’s powerful Works Council and its supervisory board.	7.627186327

TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Japan’s No.2 automaker, intends to recall 498,793 March/Micra hatchbacks in Japan to fix an external rear combination light that may not properly work.No accidents or injuries have been reported due to the fault, a Nissan spokesman said, who declined to disclose an estimate for the cost of the recall.The problem only occurs in cars sold in Japan.The faulty vehicles were built in Nissan’s Oppama factory, south of Tokyo, between February 2002 and February 2009 and its Sunderland plant in northeast England between June 2007 and December 2007.Recalls exceeding several hundred thousand vehicles have become more frequent at major automakers since they use common components across multiple models to save design and production costs.Last month, Toyota Motor Corp announced a recall of 2.77 million vehicles worldwide for steering and water pump problems, its third global recall of over one million vehicles for the year.Nissan shares were down 0.5 percent in late afternoon trade, not much different than before the release, and below an 0.6 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei 225.	11.52229746
(Reuters) - Cigarette maker Imperial Brands Plc IMB.L named Stefan Bomhard, CEO of car dealer Inchcape INCH.L, as its new chief executive on Monday to steer the company through challenges in e-cigarettes and vaping and falling consumption of tobacco products.Bombard replaces Alison Cooper, whose departure was announced last October.Bomhard joins the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes after five years at the helm of British car dealer Inchcape and, prior to that, senior roles at Cadbury, Burger King and Unilever among other consumer goods groups.He faces the task of turning around Imperial’s vaping and other ‘next generation�� products, which were meant to be the future for Imperial Brands but growth has been slower than expected.Imperial, like its peers, has been hit hard by a slowdown in e-cigarette sales after a number of vaping-related deaths and illnesses and after high rates of teen use of e-cigarettes triggered regulatory scrutiny on the safety of these products.This month the U.S. government banned the sale of some pod-based flavors for e-cigarettes, including fruit and mint, in the country. Imperial makes 30% of its profits in the United States, the world’s biggest vaping market.Bomhard will also be seeking to boost sales of Imperial’s flagship blu e-cigarette brands, which Cooper admitted were not attracting consumer loyalty despite Imperial’s marketing efforts.Imperial Brand shares have fallen nearly 23% over the past year, underperforming the broader FTSE .FTSE's 4.5% rise. They were down 0.4% at 1,942.6 pence in early trade on Monday, as the company also announced that Matthew Phillips was stepping down as chief development officer with immediate effect.“Stefan takes on the chief executive officer role at a significant point in Imperial’s development,�� Chairwoman Thérèse Esperdy said. “Stefan has significant experience across multiple consumer sectors.”As CEO, Bomhard will get an annual salary of about 1.27 million pounds ($1.7 million) and a pension allowance equivalent to a maximum of 14% of salary and other usual benefits, the company said.It did not say when he would take up the role but said Cooper had stepped down effective immediately. Dominic Brisby, currently divisional director, Americas, Africa, Asia and Australasia, and Joerg Biebernick, divisional director, Europe, will assume the roles of joint interim chief executive officers until Bomhard takes over, the company said.	-8.336289464
* Nikkei drops for 6th day* Nikkei may fall to 8,534 - analyst* Suzuki Motor climbs on strong H1, keeps full-year outlookTOKYO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei stock average fell for a sixth straight day and closed at a four-week low on Monday, hurt by a strong yen and worries about a possible U.S. fiscal crisis that may push the world’s largest economy into recessionData showing Japan’s economy had shrunk 0.9 percent in the three months to September - its first contraction in three quarters - further dulled investors�� appetite for risk, as it highlighted how slowing global growth and tensions with China are nudging the world’s third-largest economy into recession.The Nikkei fell 0.9 percent to 8,676.44, and the broader Topix dropped 1.1 percent to 722.58.Investors are concerned about the ability of the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama to strike a compromise with Congress over cutting the fiscal deficit, otherwise $600 billion worth of tax hikes and spending cuts will kick in early next year.Exporters, which will be hurt most if the United States slips into recession, took a beating. Toyota Motor Corp , Honda Motor Co, Canon Inc and Nikon Corp were down between 1.2 and 1.8 percent.Sony Corp shed 2.6 percent after Moody’s Investors Service cut the consumer electronics maker’s debt rating to Baa3, just one notch above ‘junk�� rating, citing shrinking demand for its products.“It’s partly due to the GDP,�� a trader at a foreign bank said. “It’s also partly the feeling that the yen is getting stronger again, partly the concern over the (U.S.) ‘fiscal cliff��.A stronger yen will also hurt exporters, and traders said the Bank of Japan had so far failed to convince the market its stimulus measure were having an effect on the currency.“Investors are thinking that the yen may not weaken even if the central bank eases monetary,�� said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief executive of Investrust, adding that in the next few weeks the Nikkei may test a support level of 8,534, a closing price of Oct. 12.Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank will continue to pursue powerful monetary easing, taking into account the risk that rises in the yen can hurt Japan’s economy.But he stressed that flooding markets with cash alone won’t nudge up prices in countries like Japan where interest rates are already near zero, repeating his call for government efforts to boost growth potential such as deregulation and structural reform.Adding to the gloom, company earnings have been weak this quarterly reporting season, with 59 percent of 141 Nikkei companies that have reported so far undershooting market expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. That compared with 54 percent in the previous quarter.Among the gainers were Suzuki Motor Corp, which surged 4.5 percent after the automaker’s nine-month net profit rose 30.9 percent. Suzuki also maintained its full-year outlook, saying that a decline in sales in China on anti-Japan sentiment would be offset by gains in Southeast Asia.Mazda Motor Corp climbed 1.0 percent after it and Toyota said Mazda would produce Toyota vehicles for the North American market at its new plant in Mexico.The benchmark Nikkei is still up 2.6 percent this year, trailing a 9.7 percent gain in the U.S. S&amp;P 500 and a 10.5 percent rise in the pan-European STOXX Europe 600.Credit Suisse said in a report it was keeping Japanese stocks at ‘benchmark�� in its global equities model portfolio but noted that Japan’s monetary policy remained tight and earnings momentum was poor.Credit Suisse said it was kept from going underweight by the probability that the Liberal Democratic Party will win power at elections expected next year, very cheap asset valuations and the cyclical nature of many Japanese companies.Japanese equities carry a 12-month forward price-to-book ratio of 0.83, much cheaper than the S&amp;P 500’s 1.9 and STOXX Europe 600’s 1.38, data from Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.Volume was low, with 1.26 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo stock exchange’s first section, lower than last week’s average daily volume of 1.59 billion shares.	10.28637473
DETROIT (Reuters Breakingviews) - Shareholders are leaving Auto 2.0 in the hard shoulder. As the industry gathers in Detroit for its annual confab, carmakers are revving up their plans for the next generation of vehicles. Ford on Sunday said it’s more than doubling its electric battery investment to more than $11 billion by 2022. A day earlier, General Motors revealed it had asked regulators to approve its driverless car. Toyota, Volkswagen and others are tanking up, too. Investors, though, aren’t buying it.Most of the world’s major carmakers trade in a narrow range between 7 and 9 times this year’s expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That suggests the industry is not only failing to grow, but in decline. Only Toyota and Honda are worth more than the 10 times net income that implies an expanding business, based on their estimated calendar-year results.In a usual cycle, such skepticism would be expected. Vehicle sales in North America are retreating from record highs and European growth remains sluggish. Meanwhile, interest rates are rising, albeit slowly, making car loans more expensive.This time round, though, the industry is grappling with what are likely to be fundamental changes to the business model. The wealth of data captured from connecting vehicles to the internet could represent more $120 billion-a-year revenue opportunity, reckon UBS analysts �� think everything from improved diagnostics to traffic info to infotainment and shopping.And autonomous cars may alter how we own and use transportation �� and how vehicle manufacturers make money. GM reckons it could bring in 10 times or more the average $31,000 in revenue it currently earns over the lifetime of a vehicle from owning and operating its own fleets of self-driving taxis and ride-sharing vehicles. It’s hoping to roll out its first commercial fleet of self-driving taxis in cities next year.There are admittedly questions about how fast such new technologies will be accepted and adopted. Sourcing raw materials for electric batteries is an issue, too. Miner Glencore reckons cobalt supplies will have to triple by 2030 to meet automakers�� planned demands.None of these concerns weighs on Tesla. It trades at 230 times unadjusted 2020 earnings, the first year it’s expected to turn a profit, despite missing several production targets as Chief Executive Elon Musk tries to turn it into a mass producer.Musk, of course, has a cult following. If shareholders in his longer-lived rivals had the same belief in them, carmaker valuations would soar.	-1.94969921
TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Japanese shares fell on Friday, after a sell-off in high-flying U.S. technology stocks dragged Wall Street’s main indexes to their sharpest decline in nearly three months.The benchmark Nikkei share average declined 0.96% to 23,240.95, retreating from its highest close since Feb. 21 hit in the previous session.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Panasonic Corp cut its annual profit outlook after disappointing quarterly earnings it blamed on a slowing Chinese economy hit by a trade war with the United States that hurt demand for auto components and factory equipment.Panasonic forecast an operating profit of 385 billion yen ($3.51 billion) for the year ending March, down from the previously predicted 425 billion yen and missing the 420.25 billion yen average of 18 analyst estimates polled by Refinitiv.“Demand for mechatronics, mostly motors, has plunged since November as our clients making equipment for smartphone factories cut their investment,�� Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda told a briefing.China’s shrinking car market has crimped demand for automotive components, Panasonic said, while sales have also dropped for electronic devices used in air conditioners.Panasonic’s operating profit for the October-December quarter fell 19 percent to 97.6 billion yen, far below the average 122.35 billion yen estimate of eight analysts.The energy division, which includes its battery business with U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc, provided some good news in a bleak quarter, posting its first operating profit in three quarters.“Sales and profit at the Tesla business have improved,�� Umeda said of the division’s 16.5 billion yen operating profit.He said additional lines at Tesla’s “Gigafactory�� battery plant in Nevada would be installed by the end of March, bringing the plant’s total capacity to the 35 Gigawatt hours (GWh).Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla’s current production models, saw its profits squeezed early last year by the U.S. EV maker’s initial production delays for the mass-market Model 3 sedan.Tesla expressed optimism last month that it would post profits in every quarter in 2019, but the winding down of a U.S. tax subsidy this year is expected to make Tesla cars more expensive and could hurt sales.At the briefing, Umeda said a decision had not been taken yet on how Panasonic would supply battery cells for Tesla’s new Shanghai car factory. Tesla has been in discussions with other suppliers, including China’s Tianjin Lishen.“We have production sites for cylindrical batteries in the United States, Japan and China,�� Umeda said. “We are in the process of analyzing where would be the best to supply batteries.”To reduce its heavy reliance on Tesla, Panasonic has teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp to jointly develop and produce thin, rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries, a type different from the cylindrical batteries used in Tesla EVs.Panasonic plans to supply prismatic batteries to its existing customers such as Honda Motor Co through the Toyota joint venture.“We are aiming to develop the best batteries in the industry that would be wanted by a wide range of carmakers,�� Umeda said.($1 = 109.8400 yen)	-4.003254679
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N Australian unit announced plans on Tuesday to cut up to 440 jobs, or about 15 percent of its workforce, and slash production by almost 30 percent to cope with a slide in popularity of its top model, the Falcon.Australian car manufacturers have enjoyed solid sales over the past year despite a subdued economy, although Ford’s sales have lagged, according to industry figures.The Ford Falcon was once Australia’s top-selling vehicle but now barely makes it into the top-20, hurt by a trend away from large-engine sedans in favor of small cars and sport utility vehicles, including Ford’s locally made 4WD Territory.Ford said it would cut production from 209 vehicles per day to 148 vehicles per day from November 2012 in a response to changing customer preferences, which have driven an industry-wide decline in the sale of large vehicles.“Implementing this structural change is essential to ensure the longer-term health of the business,�� Ford Australia President Bob Graziano said in a statement.He said most of the up to 440 job losses would be from the manufacturing operations in Melbourne and nearby Geelong in Victoria state. Last year, Ford cut 240 local jobs.Ford said it would shift production to a more profitable mix, including more Territory vehicles.Ford, which has more than 3,000 employees in Australia, in January secured more than A$34 million ($35 million) in funding from state and federal governments to guarantee local production until 2016.In April, the car maker introduced a four-cylinder Falcon model alongside its six- and eight-cylinder versions, hoping to win back corporate and government fleet buyers after a 24 percent slump in Falcon sales year-on-year.Ford’s market share slipped to fifth place, or 7.9 percent, for the year to June, compared with 9.1 percent a year earlier, according to the Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries.Ford trailed Toyota 7203.T, General Motors' GM.N Holden unit, Mazda 7261.T and Hyundai 005380.KS.Ford’s Australian subsidiary was founded in 1925 in Geelong and initially assembled Model Ts in a disused woolstore.Australian car makers have also lost market share as sales of imports have surged, aided by the strong Australian dollar. In April, Toyota Motor Corp cut 350 jobs from its manufacturing plant in Melbourne. ($1 = 0.9770 Australian dollars)	8.473906168
GUANGZHOU/BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor 7203.T said it would consider selling locally designed and manufactured all-electric vehicle models in China, as it looks to expand its EV lineup and comply with Beijing's upcoming new-energy vehicle (NEV) production and sales quotas.China has set strict quotas for electric and plug-in hybrid cars that come into effect from 2019. It has an ambitious target of 2 million NEV sales by 2020 and has signaled longer-term it will phase out the sale of conventional petrol-engine cars.This seismic shift towards NEVs has prompted a flurry of electric car deals and new launches as manufacturers worldwide race for a share of the world’s largest auto market.“To respond to expanding demand for EVs, more widely and more comprehensively, we have begun considering the possibility of having our China joint-venture partners provide us with EVs,�� Hiroji Onishi, Toyota’s head of China operations, said at a press briefing at the Guangzhou auto show on Friday.Foreign car manufacturers are allowed to operate in China by forming joint ventures with Chinese partners. Toyota’s joint venture partners in the country are China FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] and Guangzhou Automobile Group.Apart from the all-electric battery car models developed by its local joint ventures, Toyota also plans to launch an EV model, designed in Japan, in China in 2020.But the EV engineered in Japan would have to be produced in China to qualify for NEV credits, but it was not immediately clear whether Toyota planned to locally manufacture the EV.When China’s green car quotas take effect in 2019, automakers will need to accumulate credits by producing and selling enough NEVs to hit a threshold equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales. That level would rise to 12 percent for 2020.Toyota said it was also studying the feasibility of selling hydrogen fuel-cell commercial vehicles in China.It began testing hydrogen fuel-cell cars in China in late October as part of a study to determine the feasibility of selling its Mirai hydrogen electric passenger car in China.“We plan to continue to study fuel-cell cars�� feasibility in China and have decided expand its scope to include fuel-cell buses,�� Onishi said.	3.268716035

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court has ordered a temporary ban on the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi to combat toxic smog in the city, prompting concern in the auto sector as some carmakers say they may reconsider investment plans in the country.According to an order passed on Wednesday, the registration of sport-utility vehicles and other diesel cars with an engine capacity of 2,000 cc or more is banned in Delhi and the surrounding region with immediate effect until March 31.Delhi’s crackdown on diesel cars has unsettled the industry, its salesmen and investors, who warn the ban and uncertainty around it could derail a tentative recovery in Indian sales and leave dealers with forecourts packed with unsold cars.Environmental campaigners and the lawyer who brought the case to the Supreme Court, however, say they want to see the order extended beyond the capital to other smog-choked cities.Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, for whom the Delhi region represents almost a quarter of sales in the country, told Reuters the diesel ban and the uncertainty around it would “severely impact�� growth plans and future investment in India.“We also have to consider the loss of jobs that this will result (in) at the dealerships, at the vendors producing diesel engines,�� a spokesman said in an emailed statement, adding its own workers would be affected.The court - which said the order would not hit India’s “common man�� - stopped short of banning the smaller cars that clog India’s roads. But it did also prohibit trucks from passing through the city to reach other states and banned all trucks over 10 years old from the capital.An existing charge imposed on trucks making deliveries to Delhi itself was doubled to up to 2,600 rupees ($39).Other measures include a demand for all taxis in Delhi, mainly those operated by Uber [UBER.UL] and local rival Ola, to replace diesel with natural gas, as well as a broad, immediate ban on burning solid waste.In January, the judges will also consider an application to levy a green tax on all diesel cars sold in the country.Environmentalists have cheered Wednesday’s moves, but analysts questioned the detail of the ban.“The (higher truck) levy will just go back to whoever is hiring the trucks. So eventually the consumer ends up paying the levy and inhaling the gas fumes,�� said Deepesh Rathore, director at consultant Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors.India’s National Green Tribunal, an environmental court, last week ordered a ban on the registration of all diesel vehicles for nearly four weeks to help clean up the air in Delhi, one of the world’s most polluted cities.That triggered a share price fall among automakers which have invested heavily in diesel technology in India. The drop steepened after the Supreme Court’s order.Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, India’s top utility-vehicle maker, was one of the biggest losers with shares down 5.5 percent. It said the ban would affect roughly 2 percent of its total monthly sales.Rivals such as Tata Motors and Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s top-selling carmaker, also have popular large cars. Greater Delhi contributes 8 percent of Toyota’s sales and 80 percent of vehicles sold in this region are diesel.India’s auto industry body called for a comprehensive plan, which should include a policy to remove and scrap old vehicles.	-7.836538462
HIROSHIMA, Japan, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Japan’s Mazda Motor Corp has only a tenth of Toyota Motor Corp’s research and development budget, but is betting it can make the century-old internal combustion engine as fuel efficient as hybrids like its rival’s pioneering Prius.The gamble on developing gasoline engines, while others move increasingly towards electric cars, could also show whether a small automaker can survive independently in a high-stakes market for mass-produced passenger cars dominated by the likes of Toyota, General Motors and Volkswagen AG.“People used to say there’s no way a small carmaker could survive unless they find a partner because it wouldn’t be possible to independently pursue costly technologies like fuel cells, electric vehicles and hybrids,�� said Mitsuo Hitomi, Mazda’s top powertrain engineer. “But these may not become mainstream.”Mazda, valued at $13.5 billion and with its roots as a 1920’s machinery toolmaker, has chosen to focus on reducing the energy loss in combustion engines, with technology that is a side-show for bigger companies focused on headline-grabbing electric and hybrid vehicles. The move has already helped achieve big fuel-efficiency gains in Mazda vehicles.Gasoline engines now utilise at most around 35 percent of the fuel’s energy, with the rest lost mainly to heat and friction. Engines also typically operate well below the peak, at around 20 percent efficiency.Mazda wants to improve that to 50 percent at peak efficiency and maintain operation closer to peak levels. A first step would be with a breakthrough technology called HCCI, or homogenous charge compression ignition, Hitomi said.Honda Motor Co, GM and others have also been working on the technology for years, but it has yet to be mass-produced.“ONLY OPTION”In an HCCI engine, as in fuel-efficient diesel engines, the mix of air and fuel ignites without a spark plug, but carmakers have struggled to achieve ignition at low and high engine speeds. Mazda has solved that with a higher compression ratio, squeezing the air and fuel mixture further and boosting temperatures in the combustion chamber, Hitomi said.One remaining problem, however, is a loud noise similar to engine knocking caused by overly intense combustion when the torque, or turning force exerted by the engine, is high.Hitomi believes Mazda will be able to overcome this and hopes to have the HCCI engine ready to roll out around 2020, when strict fuel economy standards will likely be implemented in Europe.“This is very hard and we wouldn’t think of doing it if we had the number of people that would let us pursue all kinds of different technologies,�� Hitomi said. “We are here because this is the only option we have.”Hitomi said a car with an HCCI engine could have a fuel economy similar to gas-electric hybrids. That could mean that a Mazda3 kitted out with an HCCI engine could run at about 30 km per litre (71 miles per gallon) under Japanese standards, about a 50 percent increase from its current gasoline engine, and roughly on par with a Toyota Prius.Mazda’s annual vehicle sales, at around 1.2 million, are barely more than a single Toyota model, the world’s best-selling Corolla, and many of its similarly-sized peers enjoy special advantages - BMW AG is an established luxury brand; Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd is under the wing of Toyota, its biggest shareholder; and Mitsubishi Motors Corp is backed by the deep-pocketed Mitsubishi group.Mazda, which made its first passenger car in 1960, lost the protection of Ford Motor Co five years ago when the U.S. carmaker, struggling to stay afloat, cut its holding to 13 percent from a more than one-third controlling minority stake it had held for nearly three decades. That stake has since dwindled to just 2.1 percent.At the same time, Mazda was hit by a strong yen that battered the profitability of its exports. In the four years to March 2012, the company chalked up combined net losses of nearly 250 billion yen ($2.5 billion).The company - which loaned part of its Hiroshima headquarters building to the local prefecture following the city’s atomic bombing in 1945 - hunkered down with a strategy to boost fuel efficiency in its internal combustion engines, achieving gains of 15-20 percent since 2011.Together with a series of other fuel efficient technologies it calls Skyactiv, a revamped manufacturing process and stylish new designs that it was able to roll out quickly in its relatively small product range, Mazda has boosted profit margins. On each CX-5 sport-utility vehicle loaded with Skyactiv technologies, Mazda makes $1,500 more than it made on the CX-7, a sister model without Skyactiv.But it still needs to work on cutting incentives. In the United States, Mazda’s average incentive level to date this year is $1,937 as it tries to sell off older models. That’s more than Toyota’s $1,681 and Subaru’s $908, although it has dropped 6 percent from 2009, according to TrueCar.Mazda expects sales to rise 8 percent to 1.3 million vehicles in the year to March and is aiming for 1.7 million vehicles in another two years. But even that hefty growth would still leave it at a fraction of the 6 million vehicles that Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Chrysler and Fiat, once said were essential for an automaker to make annually to survive.For Mazda, the yen’s depreciation in the last year has been a big boost. The company, which exports around 80 percent of the cars it makes in Japan, booked a net profit for the first time in five years in the financial year ended in March.Mazda shares have jumped more than fivefold since hitting a life low of 85 yen in July 2012, and are currently near 5-year highs. It’s the best performing Japanese auto stock over the past 12 months, and trades at more than 2.7 times its book value - the stated worth of its assets - well above the sector median of 1.6 times, Thomson Reuters data show.While Mazda is betting heavily on the internal combustion engine, it’s not entirely rejecting hybrid technology. This month, it will start selling hybrids for the first time, combining Toyota’s hybrid technology with its Skyactiv gasoline engine in the Mazda3.Industry experts generally assign high marks to Mazda’s engineering, but some insist it will still need a partner.Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst and CEO of Nakanishi Research Institute, said Mazda’s limited product portfolio of sedans, small cars and SUVs is risky as it faces tough competition from many big rivals across all market segments.“That may have been fine while they were selling cars as a part of the Ford group, but it’s a reckless portfolio now they are on their own,�� he said.For now, recovery seems to have boosted the confidence among executives to stay independent, and CEO Masamichi Kogai said he is not thinking of an equity alliance.“The entire company is united now and confident in our own technology, our regional production structure and our sales capability. Now is the time for us to show how much we have evolved,�� he told Reuters in September. ($1 = 100.0350 Japanese yen) (Editing by Edmund Klamann and Ian Geoghegan)	-5.791352638
(Corrects headline, par 2 to show Abe is visiting Washington next month)TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Japan is scrambling to respond to rising pressure on trade from U.S. President Donald Trump, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe planning to meet the head of Toyota Motor Corp this week and business lobby Keidanren setting up a Trump task force.Abe will visit Washington next month for talks with Trump at which the U.S. leader is expected to seek quick progress toward a two-way trade deal with Japan and discuss the automotive sector.Two sources told Reuters Abe would meet with Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda, with one of them saying the meeting would take place on Friday.In a phone call with Abe on Saturday, Trump reiterated his pledge to create jobs in the United States and asked that the Japanese auto industry contribute, the Nikkei business daily reported, quoting unidentified Japanese government officials.The two leaders discussed the automotive industry, senior government spokesman Koichi Hagiuda told reporters after the phone call, without giving details. A White House statement said the two “committed to deepen the bilateral trade and investment relationship.”Abe has left open the door to discussing a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States but some officials worry Japan would have little to gain while coming under intense pressure from Washington. Bilateral talks on specific sectors such as autos, however, are an option, officials have said.Trump, who last week dropped out of the multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership pushed by his predecessor Barack Obama and favoured by Abe, has also attacked Japan’s auto market as closed in an echo of criticism heard decades ago.Japanese officials have rejected that criticism, saying Japan does not impose tariffs on U.S. auto imports nor put up discriminatory non-tariff barriers.Toyota has come under fire from Trump for plans, announced in 2015, to shift production of its Corolla to Mexico from Canada. Earlier this month, Japan’s top automaker said it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, the same as the previous five years.Toyota says it directly employed about 40,000 American workers as of December 2015 and indirectly more than 200,000 if both dealers and suppliers are included.Japan’s business lobby Keidanren wants to beef up its information gathering and analysis of the Trump administration’s policies while also conveying data on Japan Inc’s importance to the U.S. economy, a Keidanren official said.“We will create a task force the main purpose of which is to convey correct information about the contribution of Japanese firms in the United States,�� said another Keidanren official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to media.Japan’s government is already trying to give Trump’s administration a crash course on its companies�� contribution to U.S. jobs and growth, with fact sheets showing, among other things, that Japanese companies created 839,000 jobs in America, second only to Britain.Japanese media, meanwhile, have begun reminiscing about heated U.S.-Japan auto talks in the mid-1990s, in which a last minute deal in June 1995 averted U.S. tariffs on Japanese luxury cars when Japan’s automakers crafted “voluntary plans�� to boost purchases of U.S. auto parts and expand production in the United States.

BRASILIA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp presented the Brazilian government on Tuesday with a preliminary plan to establish a local factory building hybrid vehicles in exchange for new tax incentives.That could make Toyota the first company producing such cars in Brazil, where high production costs, a huge sugar ethanol industry and a market focused on entry-level subcompacts have marginalized the role of electric and hybrid vehicles.Toyota would initially increase imports of hybrids. The company began selling its hybrid Prius to the Brazilian public in January at a cost of more than 120,000 reais ($55,000).“The initial idea would be to import and later produce locally,�� Luiz Carlos Andrade Jr, a senior vice-president for Toyota, told journalists in Brasilia.“A technology like this needs to be incentivized,�� he said after a meeting with finance ministry officials. “We presented the possibility of making hybrid vehicles in the country.”National carmaker association Anfavea proposed in early July that Brazil eliminate an industrial tax for manufacturers of electric and hybrid cars through 2017.Government officials made no public comments on Toyota’s proposal.	-1.735257985

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T best-selling 2013 Camry received a ""poor"" crash-test rating on Thursday from an insurance industry group that awarded high marks to Honda Motor Co's 7267.T redesigned Accord sedan.The Camry -- the top-selling passenger car in the United States for 14 of the past 15 years -- and the Accord were among a group of 2013-model midsize cars tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a non-profit group funded by the insurance industry.The 2012 Camry, after it was redesigned last year, was named a Top Safety Pick by IIHS. It also received a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as part of the federal safety group’s New Car Assessment Program.IIHS this year has implemented a more stringent frontal crash test, designed to “replicate what happens when the front corner of a car collides with another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole.”It said only two cars -- the 2013 Accord and the 2013 Suzuki Kizashi 7269.T -- received the top rating of ""good"" in the new test. Two cars -- the 2013 Camry and the 2013 Toyota Prius v -- received the lowest rating of ""poor.""Eleven cars, including the redesigned 2013 Ford Fusion F.N and 2013 Nissan Altima 7201.T, were rated ""acceptable"" and three cars, including the 2013 Chevrolet Malibu and the 2013 Hyundai Sonata, were rated ""marginal.""“Toyota engineers have a lot of work to do to match the performance of their competitors,�� IIHS said in a statement released Thursday with the latest crash-test results.Toyota spokesman Mike Michels said the automaker “will respond to the challenge.”�We are evaluating the new test protocols and can say that there will not be one single solution to achieve greater crash performance in this area,�� Michels said.Through November, Camry’s U.S. sales totaled 373,479, up 36 percent from the previous year, while Accord sales totaled 302,444, up 39 percent."	2.375040484

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday that it would delay the Japan launch of its plug-in Prius gasoline hybrid model to winter, from an initial schedule of autumn.The automaker declined to give a reason for the delay or be more specific about the timing.A spokesman said it would reduce initial production of the model, although output would eventually pick up according to demand.Previously, Toyota had said that it would begin sales of the plug-in version in Japan in autumn, and that the model would become available in North America and Europe around late autumn.Sales of the standard version of the fourth-generation Prius, the forefather of the “eco car��, have been sluggish in the United States since it went on sale around February, as low gasoline prices have ramped up demand for gas-guzzling SUVs and pick-up trucks.Meanwhile, it has been the best-selling model in Japan since the start of the year.(This version of the story corrects headline and first paragraph to say launch delayed in Japan, not globally; also clarifies headline to say launch is for plug-in Prius)	10.9112383

(Adds Honda’s recall on Monday, Takata expanded recalls last month)DETROIT, June 16 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will recall almost 1.37 million more vehicles in the United States due to potentially deadly front passenger-side air bags made by Japan’s Takata Corp, Toyota said on Tuesday.The expansion pushes the total number of Toyota vehicles recalled in the United States because of dangers posed by Takata air bags to more than 2.9 million.Some Takata air bags have opened with too much force, sending shrapnel into vehicles. U.S. safety officials, as well as Takata officials, have said that exposure to humidity over time has been a factor in the erroneous air bag deployments.Seven deaths linked to Takata air bags have occurred in Honda Motor Co cars, six of them in the United States.On Monday, Honda announced the recall of 1.39 million Accord and Civic cars in the United States with faulty front passenger-side Takata air bags. Those cars had previously been recalled for front driver-side air bags.Last month, U.S. safety officials said Takata had doubled its recall of vehicles in the United States to 34 million, and to 53 million globally. Automakers said the number of vehicles affected in the United States is likely half of that total because some have been recalled several times.There have been 24 incidents of incorrect deployments of Takata air bags in Toyota vehicles worldwide, and Toyota has received at least eight reports of injuries said to be linked to air bag ruptures, a Toyota spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Toyota officials have not confirmed those injuries were linked to incorrect deployments, she said.She said that Toyota is not aware of any injuries or fatalities caused by incorrect air bag deployments in the vehicles in the expanded recall it announced on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Thursday said it plans to set up a facility to mass manufacture hydrogen fuel cell stacks, a key component of fuel cell vehicles, as it seeks to ramp up production of hydrogen-powered cars and expand their usage as a zero-emission alternative to gasoline vehicles.The new unit will come up on the grounds of its Honsha plant in Toyota City near the automaker’s global headquarters, the company said in a statement. It is also constructing a dedicated line at the nearby Shimoyama plant to produce tanks for storing high-pressure hydrogen gas inside vehicles.Toyota declined to give details about their latest investment in this technology, but said mass production of components will begin around 2020, enabling the company to meet its target for global annual fuel cell vehicle sales of more than 30,000 units, including passenger cars and buses.“As a technology, fuel cells are mature and ready to scale up,�� Toyota said in a statement. “In order to encourage more widespread use of hydrogen-powered zero-emission vehicles, popularization needs to start by the 2020s.”Toyota already sells the Mirai sedan, the world’s first mass-market fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), in Japan, in the United States and also some European countries. The model starts at about 7.2 million yen ($65,807.51) in the Japan market.Due to its high cost and complexity of building its components, the Mirai is produced in small lots. Only around 5,300 units have been sold since its 2014 launch, a fraction of regular production models.Mass manufacturing of the two components - hydrogen fuel cell stacks and hydrogen tanks - will enable Toyota to lower the price of FCEVs, and expand its fuel cell technology.Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS also manufacture fuel cell vehicles, while other automakers are also developing the technology. However, many automakers, including Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Tesla Inc TSLA.O, are focusing on all-battery electric cars as a solution to reduce vehicle emissions.Toyota, which developed the Prius, the world’s first gasoline hybrid vehicle, sees hydrogen FCEVs as a zero-emission alternative, which requires less time to refuel compared with the time it takes recharge electric vehicle batteries.	-2.922077922
(Reuters) - The United Auto Workers on Friday filed for an election by 165 skilled trades workers at the Volkswagen AG auto plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the labor union said.The union lost an election to represent all 1,500 hourly production workers at the plant in February 2014.The filing for the election was made Friday with the National Labor Relations Board. Federal law allows a portion of a work location to be represented by a union, the UAW said.No date for an election has been set, a UAW spokesman said.Volkswagen did not immediately respond when asked for comment.Gary Casteel, UAW secretary-treasurer and head of the union’s effort to organize non-union auto plants, said VW’s current form of recognition that allows union access to management on plant issues is short of the right to collectively bargain for workers that the UAW desires.“Volkswagen’s policy in Chattanooga was a gesture and our local union has engaged accordingly,�� said Casteel. “At the end of the day, the policy cannot be a substitute for meaningful employee representation and co-determination with management.”The Chattanooga plant has been viewed by the UAW for several years as its best chance to organize a foreign-owned plant in the southern United States. German, Japanese and South Korean companies have placed plants in the region where most states are so-called “right-to-work,�� where union membership cannot be a requirement of employment.VW, which has a history of worker recognition through German-styled works councils that include blue- and white-collar employees, at its plants around the world, has been the least hostile foreign automaker to the union in its efforts to organize auto workers.The UAW is in talks for a new four-year contract with General Motors Co after the union’s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV membership ratified a new deal for its 40,000 U.S. union workers.Labor analysts say that the pay and benefits for union workers at the Detroit Three automakers influence labor costs for non-union southern U.S. plants of Volkswagen, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors.Regarding pay, the non-union plants, said labor analyst Arthur Schwartz, “don’t want to get too far out of whack because that would invite the UAW in. Georgetown in Kentucky (where Toyota has a large plant) has basically tried to keep pace and so far it’s worked.��	-1.76334477
TOKYO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH is seeking to increase its business with Japanese carmakers and take advantage of their plans to increase the number of common parts across models, its chief executive said on Friday.Japanese carmakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co are following the footsteps of German rival Volkswagen to increase “commonality��, which is the proportion of parts that can be shared among various vehicle models. Bosch is a key supplier to Volkswagen.Shared parts mean suppliers can produce a larger number of fewer parts, cutting the unit price. It also makes it easier for automakers to build a variety of vehicle size and shapes.“For a company like Bosch, this is an advantage because it will increase the volume, which will also help us to reduce costs,�� Chief Executive Volkmar Denner told reporters in Tokyo.“Parts of this volume, they have to come from different locations worldwide in order to fulfil local content requirements...We are established with R&amp;D, with application, with manufacturing, in all markets of the world where vehicles are produced.”Toyota announced last year its shared-parts strategy dubbed “Toyota New Global Architecture��. The first car to be fully developed under the programme is expected to be the revamped Prius for late-2014 release, analysts say.Nissan has also been pursuing a shared-platform architecture called “common module family��, with the first series of cars under the plan set to roll out this year.Bosch, which supplies auto parts including anti-lock brake systems and electronic stability controls to Japanese automakers, saw business with them grow by about 8 percent in 2012, Denner said.Bosch competes with Japan’s Denso Corp for the title of the world’s biggest auto parts supplier.The German conglomerate said in January that it will not reach its long-term profit target this year after it booked heavy losses at its photovoltaic business in 2012.“We cannot of course finance continuous losses forever. We have to find a solution,�� Denner said. “We know which direction we want to go, but today it’s still too early to make any further announcement.”For 2012, Bosch expects its earnings before interest and taxes at around 1 billion euro ($1.32 billion), after seeing a 1 billion euro loss in the photovoltaic business.	3.912693623

TOKYO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Japanese shares tumbled on Thursday, with the Nikkei falling about 2%, after jobs data from the U.S. cemented concerns that the trade war with China is taking toll on the U.S. economy and as Washington opened a new trade war front with Europe.The Nikkei share average fell 1.93% to 21,358.10, hitting its lowest levels in more than three weeks while the broader Topix lost 1.87% to 1,566.51, also a three-week low.The ADP National Employment Report in the United States showed private payrolls growth in August was not as strong as previously estimated, another worrying signal after a report on Tuesday showing U.S. September factory activity contracted by the most in more than a decade.The Trump administration said it will slap 25% tariffs on French wine, Italian cheese and single-malt Scotch whisky, in retaliation for European Union subsidies on large aircraft, threatening to trigger a tit-for-tat trans-Atlantic trade war.“While direct impacts on Japanese shares should be limited, markets are looking at them in terms of whether the world is heading further to protectionism, which will be bad for the global economy,�� said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities.As investors fret about possible U.S. recession, Japanese cyclical shares led Thursday’s losses with securities brokerages falling 2.9% and transport equipment makers losing 2.8%.Daiwa Securities Group Inc dropped 3.3% and Nomura Holdings Inc fell 2.1%.Among automakers, Toyota Motor Corp slid 2.4% while Suzuki Motor Corp lost 3.3% and Nissan Motor 2.8%.Insurers were among big losers too, with T&amp;D Holdings falling 3.9% after U.S. financials underperformed on Wednesday.About 95% of shares declined in early trade, with all of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s 33 industry subindexes posting losses.Markets players say the selling was inevitable given many shares had been overbought.So-called up-down ratio, which measures the number of shares that have risen over the past 25 days against those that have fallen, has risen to 141%, way above 120% mark usually seen as a sign of short-term overheating.

(Adds Bracken declining to say what type of vehicle Lexus has planned, revises headline)TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand is planning to launch a second top-of-the-line “flagship�� model to accompany a new generation of its LS sedan, the head of the brand’s U.S. operations told Reuters on Wednesday.“We need a flagship. It doesn’t have to be a sedan,�� Jeff Bracken, Lexus division general manager, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference.Bracken would not say what type of vehicle the second flagship Lexus would be.Sales of large luxury sedans such as the Lexus LS have slowed in recent years as affluent consumers have shifted toward luxury SUVs.Rival luxury car makers have been winning customers with vehicles such as Tata Motors�� Land Rover brand, the Cadillac Escalade from General Motors Co and large SUVs coming from the German luxury automakers. The SUV surge has prompted even luxury brands with no history of selling SUVs, such as BMW’s Rolls-Royce, to develop models to compete in the super luxury SUV segment.U.S. sales have been supported by a prolonged drop in gasoline prices. Average prices at the pump on Tuesday were $2.63, down 25 percent from a year ago, according to the AAA travel group.“In addition to the LS (a large sedan), there could be another flagship in our lineup,�� Bracken said. “We’ll define what it is in January.”Lexus also is looking to strengthen its SUV lineup by offering a version of the midsize RX SUV with a third row seat. An RX with room for seven or eight passengers is the No. 1 request from U.S. Lexus dealers, Bracken said. A new RX is due this fall but will not have a third row seat.“We don’t want to wait for a next generation�� to add the extra seating row, Bracken said.

(Corrects sixth paragraph to show Toyota is reporting first-quarter, not first-half, results on Thursday.)* Toyota H1 sales fall 1.5 pct to 5.02 mln cars* VW reported 5.04 mln H1 deliveries on July 17* Toyota says emerging markets, mini-vehicle taxes weighedBy Andreas Cremer and Minami FunakoshiMUNICH/TOKYO, July 28 (Reuters) - Volkswagen overtook Toyota as the world’s largest carmaker by sales in the first half year, achieving its long-held ambition three years ahead of target.But staying on top will be a challenge for the German maker of the Golf and Polo, as deliveries are falling in China, destination of a third of its global sales, making it overly reliant on relatively stagnant western European demand.“The hunt for scale only makes sense if it boosts synergies, something VW hasn’t really been able to achieve,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank. “Dependence on China is VW’s weak spot and managing such a large group inevitably poses problems.”VW has been pushing for greater scale under Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn’s eight-year reign, propelled by adding brands and factories and roaring sales in China.The German group on July 17 reported 5.04 million deliveries in the first half year. By comparison, Toyota said on Tuesday it sold 5.02 million cars between January and June, a 1.5 percent decline on year-ago levels.Toyota, due to announce first-quarter earnings next Tuesday, said sales were dragged down by a slowdown in emerging markets and increased taxes on mini vehicles in Japan.VW’s rapid expansion has masked underperformance in the United States and Brazil, where it has been slow to upgrade models and adjust its offerings to market trends, analysts say.Although boosting market share and brand awareness, VW’s race for volume has triggered a costly proliferation of models and equipment, especially in its core passenger-car brand where profit margins have languished amid growing inefficiencies.With over 310 models and nearly 120 factories worldwide, VW’s size may be turning into a disadvantage, forming the backdrop to a leadership crisis in April when ex-chairman Ferdinand Piech was ousted after publicly criticizing CEO Winterkorn.VW’s top management has since been trying to regain the initiative, though other top players, notably its unions and stakeholder Lower Saxony, are seeking to influence the course of its move to a leaner structure as VW is pushing 5 billion euros of cost savings in its core division.Wolfsburg-based VW last year started shifting its focus to boosting earnings quality to help fund growing technology needs and plant upgrades.VW has a goal of “moderately�� raising deliveries from last year’s record 10.14 million cars. The group will publish first-half results on Wednesday. ($1 = 0.9042 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and David Holmes)	-8.900957984
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday it had invested an additional $700 million and added 150 new jobs to complete a $1.3 billion modernization program at its Princeton, Indiana factory.The investment is part of a broader commitment from Japan’s biggest automaker to invest $13 billion in its U.S. operations over five years through 2021.Including the $1.3 billion investment at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana (TMMI) plant, the company has so far spent about $7.1 billion of the total amount, Toyota said.The refurbished TMMI plant, which has added 550 new jobs so far, will help Toyota meet strong demand for the Highlander, its new mid-size SUV.The plant has over 7,000 employees and has the capacity to assemble more than 420,000 vehicles annually, the company said.	-2.107037505
"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein has resigned from the board of The Weinstein Company, it said on Tuesday, as he faces allegations that he sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women over three decades in the film business.In a statement, the board said it also ratified its Oct. 8 decision to fire Weinstein as chief executive of the award-winning movie and television company he co-founded with his brother.A source close to Weinstein confirmed that he had resigned from the board and had no further comment. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Also on Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus unit said it was evaluating its partnership with the Weinstein Co. Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand, is a sponsor of reality TV show ""Project Runway,"" which Weinstein Co produces.“Lexus does not condone any acts of sexual harassment, assault or discrimination. In light of recent allegations involving Harvey Weinstein, we are currently evaluating our partnership with The Weinstein Company, but have nothing to announce at this time,�� Lexus said in a statement.A&amp;E Television Networks, which airs “Project Runway�� on its Lifetime cable channel, is also exploring its options for the show, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.Weinstein’s executive producer credit and the Weinstein Co logo were removed from “Project Runway�� last week.A&amp;E wants to be respectful of women who say they were harmed by Weinstein, the source said, and also is concerned about the livelihood of more than 200 cast and crew members who work on the series.Weinstein Co is trying to chart a future without Weinstein, the aggressive dealmaker with a knack for managing Hollywood talent, money and egos. On Monday, it said it was in talks to sell the bulk of its assets to private equity firm Colony Capital.One of Hollywood’s most influential forces since launching in October 2005, Weinstein Co has produced and distributed films including “The King’s Speech�� and “Silver Linings Playbook.�� Its television unit produces the long-running reality series “Project Runway.”Harvey Weinstein is credited with conceiving the strategy that scored dozens of Oscar awards for the company’s films.Hollywood trade publication Variety on Tuesday reported a separate harassment allegation against Bob Weinstein, Harvey’s younger brother and co-founder of Weinstein Co.Bert Fields, an attorney for Bob Weinstein, said in a statement that the story was “false and misleading.”�There is no way in the world that Bob Weinstein is guilty of sexual harassment,�� Fields said in the statement."	-0.780621278
* FY2012/13 operating profit seen growing by 2.7 times* Honda sees bigger U.S. car market, raises own forecast* Honda to focus on beefing up small-car line-up - exec* Sees neutral impact from forex this year* Mazda falls into red, hit by strong yenBy Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co forecast a near-tripling of operating profit in the year ahead on surging Asian sales and a recovery in the United States, marking an emphatic rebound from a 2011 hammered by the yen’s record strength and natural disasters.Japan’s No.3 automaker is expected to ride faster-than-expected growth in demand in the United States, its biggest and most profitable market, where sales of the remodelled CR-V crossover have jumped by more than a quarter so far this year.For the year to next March, Honda forecast an operating profit of 620 billion yen ($7.7 billion), up from 231.36 billion yen in the financial year just ended. The forecast was slightly behind analysts�� consensus for 645 billion yen, but bullish nonetheless for a company noted for its conservative earnings guidance.“It’s a pretty positive forecast, but they were the worst hit automaker by the tsunami and the Thai floods, so they should be returning or have returned to normal production,�� said Fujio Ando, senior managing director at Chibagin Asset Management.Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told a news conference Honda now expects the overall U.S. market to grow to 14.3 million vehicles this year, up from a forecast of 13.5 million made at the end of last year, and Honda aimed to recover a market share of more than 10 percent as soon possible.“The North American market is slowly recovering, while we’re entering new segments in Asia,�� he said. “We’re expecting to grow faster than the overall market.”Honda, which has lagged a recovery from the effects of disasters in Japan and Thailand by rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, more than doubled its fiscal fourth-quarter operating profit, ending five straight quarters of year-on-year decline.January-March operating profit jumped to 111.98 billion yen ($1.4 billion), but slightly lagged an average estimate of 123.2 billion yen in a survey of 23 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net profit, which includes earnings made in China, rose 60.7 percent to 71.59 billion yen.Honda set its dollar rate assumption for the business year at 80 yen and the euro at 105 yen, predicting neutral impact on profits from currencies this year.Honda was the last Japanese car maker to get its supply chain in order after a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, and only re-started work at its Thai car plant at the end of last month following October’s floods.Giving robust sales guidance, Honda forecast its global car sales would jump 38.4 percent to 4.3 million vehicles and its motorcycle sales would increase 10.2 percent to 16.6 million in 2012/13.It sees sales in North America rising 31.5 percent to 1.74 million vehicles, sales in Japan climbing 20.7 percent to 710,000 and the rest of Asia by 56.5 percent to 1.31 million.Honda will make minor changes later this year to the year-old Civic after the latest version of the perennially popular model was panned by critics, raising deeper concerns over whether the automaker was slipping in a battlefield made tougher by products from Hyundai Motor Co and resurgent U.S. rivals Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co .“The biggest challenge we see in the year ahead is the intensifying competition in all markets,�� said E xecutive Vice President Iwamura. He added that Honda would pour its energy into beefing up its products in the small-car segments to compete better in emerging markets.Honda CEO Takanobu Ito has conceded that the company he took over in mid-2009 may have let down its guard during the previous decade of rapid expansion, while pulling back on vehicle development too much after the global financial crisis.Its shares have risen 5.6 percent in the past three months, lagging gains of around 14 percent by both Toyota and Nissan.Honda is under intense scrutiny to redeem itself with U.S. consumers t his fall with the next version of the Accord, which will be the first major model to carry a new generation of engines and transmissions that it hopes will make its future cars the most fuel-efficient in their categories.Also on Friday, Mazda Motor Corp reported a 38.72 billion yen operating loss for the year ended in March, against a profit of 23.84 billion yen in 2010/11. Japan’s fifth-largest automaker is heavily exposed to the strong yen, exporting 77 percent of its domestic output.Toyota will report on May 9 and Nissan on May 11 .	-5.783810223
"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is exploring options in the aerial taxi market, including whether to build the vehicles known colloquially as ""flying cars,"" as part of a push by the U.S. automaker to look for growth in related transportation markets, two people familiar with the matter said.Chief Executive Mary Barra on Monday briefly made her first reference ever to Detroit-based GM’s interest in the air taxi market, saying that it fit with development of electric vehicles (EVs) and its Ultium advanced electric battery.“We believe strongly in our EV future and not just for vehicles,�� she said at an RBC conference. “The strength and flexibility of our Ultium battery system opens doors�� for many uses, she added, “including aerial mobility.”Air taxis are vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that use electric motors instead of jet engines. Designed to avoid the need for long runways, they have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they could add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.GM spokesman Stuart Fowle declined to elaborate. “It’s an area we’re really excited about and looking at.”GM shares rose as much as 5.4% and were still up 1.4% in afternoon trading.Corporate and private investors have poured at least $2.3 billion into more than 100 aerial vehicle startups, including drones and electric air taxis, but the technology still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to investor website PitchBook.GM is weighing all options - whether to build, supply or partner - as it decides whether to join such automakers as Hyundai Motor Co005380.KS, Toyota Motor Corp7203.T, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, Volkswagen AGVOWG_p.DE and Geely Automobile 0175.HK in the still-developing market, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. GM could make an announcement early next year. “I am not surprised that GM and others are looking into this,�� said investor and corporate adviser Evangelos Simoudis, managing director of Synapse Partners. He noted that companies like Amazon.com and Walmart are pushing to use package delivery drones, but said transporting people with flying cars will take a lot longer to develop as a business.GM’s study of the aerial mobility market is part of the push by GM’s innovation group to explore other transportation markets for growth, one of the sources said. The group is headed by Alan Wexler, who reports to Barra and was hired in July in the newly created position of senior vice president of innovation and growth.Other efforts that originated in the innovation group include formation of a defense business unit and a $214 million contract to build troop carriers for the U.S. Army based on the Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as a new mobile app for OnStar members.Hyundai teamed up with Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N in January to develop electric air taxis and has pledged to invest $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025.Toyota led a $590 million investment round in air taxi startup Joby in January, while Daimler and Geely have invested in Stuttgart-based Volocopter. Volkswagen's Porsche brand is working with BoeingBA.N to develop a concept electric flying vehicle.Last year, TeslaTSLA.O CEO Elon Musk called electric supersonic VTOL a ""hard problem,"" and last month said a more powerful battery that could enable electric airplanes was three to four years away. Musk has said ""many exciting things"" will be unveiled during Tesla's Battery Day on Sept. 22.Separately on Tuesday, the World Economic Forum and the city of Los Angeles released a set of principles to support the rollout of urban air mobility in U.S. cities, and a spokeswoman for the organization said it is talks with other cities to adopt the same roadmap."	-2.529284489

(Adds detail on lawsuit)Oct 27 (Reuters) - Takata Corp, the Japanese company whose potentially defective airbags have led to the recall of millions of vehicles, was sued on Monday by consumers who claimed Takata and several car manufacturers defrauded them by concealing crucial information.The lawsuit, filed with a U.S. District Court in Florida, is believed to be the first in the United States to seek class-action status on behalf of consumers nationwide.If that status is granted, it could subject Takata to a larger payout in a trial or settlement than if vehicle owners were forced to sue individually.The federal lawsuit is at least the third filed against Takata in the last week over alleged airbag defects. The other lawsuits were brought on behalf of individual owners.A Takata representative in the U.S. could not immediately be reached.The lawsuit also names car manufacturers as defendants, including Toyota and Honda. Representatives for those companies in the U.S. also could not immediately be reached.U.S. safety regulators are investigating whether Takata airbag inflators made from 2000 to 2007 were improperly sealed or subject to other defects.At least four deaths and dozens of injuries have been linked to faulty Takata airbags, and their potential to rupture and spray metal shrapnel at vehicle occupants.Takata “had a duty to disclose these safety issues because they consistently marketed their vehicles as reliable and safe,�� the lawsuit said.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has urged owners of an estimated 7.8 million Chrysler, Ford , General Motors, BMW, Honda, Mazda , Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan, Fuji Heavy’s Subaru and Toyota vehicles to replace their airbagsThe case in U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida is Craig Dunn et al vs. Takata Corporation et al, 14-cv-24009.

Keselowski hangs on for Xfinity win at KentuckyBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeSPARTA, Ky. -- Brad Keselowski held off Erik Jones and a charging Kyle Busch after a restart with 31 laps left and collected his first NASCAR Xfinity Series victory of the season in Friday night’s Kentucky 300 at Kentucky Speedway.A late two-tire call put Keselowski in front for a restart on Lap 170, and though the No. 22 Team Penske Ford ceded the lead to Jones for 22 circuits, Keselowski regained the top spot with a daring move to the inside through traffic entering the tri-oval on Lap 92 and held on to win by less than a quarter of a second.The victory was Keselowski’s third at Kentucky and the 33rd of his career. Behind Keselowski, Jones and Busch, Daniel Suarez ran fourth, followed by Elliott Sadler and Paul Menard.Over the final run, Jones injected himself into what had been a two-way battle between Keselowski and Busch for the majority of the race.Keselowski made the winning move after Jones�� progress was impeded by a lapped car in Turns 3 and 4 on Lap 92.“I just caught a little break, to be honest,�� Keselowski said. “One of the lapped cars locked in Erik. He had done a heck of job and still was doing a heck of a job, and sometimes things don’t go your way.“I kind of thought it might happen and went into the corner high, just ready for something to happen, and it did, and I was able to make the most of it coming off Turn 4 and make the pass for the lead.“This team, the 22 team since it started in 2010, has been really a dream ride and an honor for me to be a part of it.”Jones got the lead on the final restart when Busch shoved Keselowski and caused the No. 22 Ford to spin its tires.“I wish I would have known the lapped car was going to the bottom and he would have went to the top,�� Jones said. “Getting the lead on the restart, we had a shot at it at that point. It was good enough to maintain, and it’s a bummer it didn’t work out.“But it’s nice to be running with those guys, with Kyle and Brad, and to be mixing it up with ‘em. We’ll keep building and see what we can do next time.”At the outset, it didn’t take Busch long to move up from his sixth starting position to the lead. On Lap 16, the No. 54 Toyota shot past Ty Dillon through Turns 1 and 2 and took over the top spot for the first time in the race.With the exception of the restart lap after a competition caution on Lap 25 -- with Paul Menard surging ahead by a nose at the stripe to lead Lap 31 -- Busch stayed firmly in control of the proceedings until a caution for Ryan Sieg’s spin in Turn 4 on Lap 71 slowed the field for the third time.After pit stops under yellow, Keselowski wrestled the lead from Busch on Lap 79, moments before the No. 13 of Derek White clobbered the outside wall between Turns 3 and 4 to cause the fourth caution.Undeterred by the yellow, Keselowski sped away after the subsequent restart on Lap 85 as Busch fell back to third behind Suarez. Busch, however, regained the second position on Lap 97 and narrowed his gap to the leader to a half-second before Keselowski pulled away to a 1.8-second advantage when Busch ran afoul of lapped traffic.But Busch grabbed the top spot from Keselowski during an exchange of green-flag pit stops on Laps 136 and 137, leaving Keselowski at a half-second disadvantage. With both drivers saving fuel in the event of a green-flag run to the finish, Busch opened a one-second edge and maintained it until John Wes Townley’s brush with the wall on Lap 163 brought out the fifth caution.Busch and Keselowski led the top cars to pit road on Lap 165, with Busch opting for four tires and Keselowski, Jones and Suarez for right sides only.That left Keselowski in the lead and Busch in fourth for a restart on Lap 170. And on this night, two tires won the day, as Keselowski led Jones to the stripe by .241 seconds.NOTE: Eleventh-place finisher Chris Buescher extended his series lead to 36 points over Chase Elliott, who ran 13th, the first driver one lap down.NASCAR XFINITY Series Race - Kentucky 300Kentucky SpeedwaySparta, KentuckyFriday, July 10, 20151.

WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A former director of Japan’s Denso Corp has agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice in connection with a U.S. Justice Department probe into companies fixing the prices of automobile heater control panels, the department said on Thursday.Kazuaki Fujitani, whose job was to oversee sales of Denso products to Toyota, deleted emails and other documents after learning in 2010 about the price-fixing investigation in the United States, according to the Justice Department. The documents pertained to discussions between Denso and competitors regarding Toyota’s request for price quotes.Fujitani has agreed to serve one year and one day in a U.S. prison, the Justice Department said.He is one of three Denso executives who have been charged as part of the investigation. Denso itself had pleaded guilty to price-fixing and agreed to pay a $78 million fine.Twenty-five other companies have also pleaded guilty. So far, 29 executives have been charged.Law enforcement authorities in the United States and elsewhere have brought price-fixing cases related to more than 30 car parts, including seat belts, radiators, windshield wipers, air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components.	-7.220216606
(Repeats story published on Wednesday)MILAN/DETROIT, April 8 (Reuters) - Global automakers reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic are accelerating efforts to restart factories from Wuhan to Maranello to Michigan, using safety protocols developed for China and U.S. ventilator production operations launched in recent weeks.Certain safety measures differ from manufacturer to manufacturer. Italian sports car maker Ferrari NV said on Wednesday it would offer voluntary blood tests to employees who wanted to know if they had been exposed to the virus.General Motors Co’s head of workplace safety, Jim Glynn, told Reuters on Wednesday GM is not persuaded blood tests are useful. But Glynn said GM has studied and adapted measures taken by Amazon.com Inc to protect warehouse workers, such as temperature screening to catch employees with fevers before they enter the workplace.Auto manufacturers and suppliers are converging on a consensus that temperature screening, daily health questionnaires, assembly lines redesigned to keep workers 3 to 6 feet (0.9 m to 1.8 m) apart, and lots and lots of masks and gloves can enable large-scale factories to operate safely.“We know the protocols to keep people safe,�� Gerald Johnson, GM’s executive vice president for global manufacturing, told Reuters in an interview. GM has relaunched vehicle plants in China and kept factories running in South Korea, he said.GM has not said when it will reopen assembly plants in the United States. Other automakers are putting dates out in public, even though health officials and federal and state policymakers are wary of lifting lockdowns too soon.“You see vehicle manufacturers ... putting a stake in the ground,�� said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group’s automotive practice. By setting a public date to restart production, they signal suppliers to get ready to ramp up, he said.The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the global auto industry into the worst tailspin since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Consumer demand for vehicles has collapsed as governments have enforced lockdowns in China, and then in Europe and the United States. For the Detroit automakers and their suppliers, the shutdown of profitable truck and sport utility vehicle plants in North America has choked off cash flow.In Europe, major automakers have said they hope to begin building vehicles again in mid-to-late April. In the United States, several big automakers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , Honda Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp, are aiming to restart production during the first week of May.Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and unions are discussing plans for beefed-up health measures at Italian plants to pave the way for production to restart as soon as the government eases a national lockdown due to expire on April 13, unions said on Wednesday.Among the proposals from Fiat Chrysler’s Italian unions: move meals to the end of shifts, allowing employees to chose to avoid canteens, eat their food elsewhere and leave half an hour earlier without losing pay.FCA did not comment on specific measures.In the United States, some non-union automakers have also said they hope to restart vehicle plants as soon as next week.Tire maker Bridgestone said on Wednesday it plans to restart U.S. production on April 13.But the Trump administration has said people should continue to practice social distancing until April 30.For the Detroit automakers, the United Auto Workers union will play a key role in deciding when and how plants will restart.UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement on Wednesday the union is in “deep discussions with all three companies to plan ahead over the implementation of CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] safety standards and using all available technologies to protect all UAW members, their families and the public.”Among the union’s concerns is that members who report being ill can take time away from work without penalty, Gamble added.The UAW has supported GM and Ford Motor Co’s efforts to launch production of ventilators in U.S. plants - operations that have allowed the companies and the union to road-test safety measures at small scale.At GM’s ventilator assembly plant in Kokomo, Indiana, workers and managers have been fine-tuning details such as when employees are handed masks, and when they step in front of a temperature screening device.At first, ventilator assemblers in training at Kokomo walked down a hall before getting a mask, said Debby Hollis, one of the UAW-represented workers. Last week, she said, “They met us at the door and had us get in the masks there.”The time workers spend putting on extra protective gear, the time spent doing extra cleaning, and spreading workers out on assembly lines designed to have one vehicle roll off the end every 60 seconds could undercut productivity.“If we can protect employees we can get work done,�� said Johnson, the GM manufacturing chief. “The magnitude of the incremental cost is irrelevant. Costs will be managed.�� (Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari in Milan, David Shepardson in Washington and Nick Carey and Joseph White in Detroit Writing by Joseph White Editing by Matthew Lewis)	1.946231239
LE MANS, France, June 17 (Reuters) - Fernando Alonso’s hopes of winning the Le Mans 24 Hours race at the first attempt were on the rise on Sunday after his number eight Toyota regained the lead from the Japanese manufacturer’s seven car.The Spaniard put in a remarkable stint during the night to reduce a two minute deficit after a stop-go penalty and team mates Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima then did their bit to take back control.“Tell me if you want another stint, eh? I’ve got into the rhythm of the night,�� Alonso had said over the team radio as he closed the gap.Instead, he handed over to Nakajima, who then passed fellow-Japanese Kamui Kobayashi for the lead.With seven hours remaining and both cars handed further stop-go penalties for speeding in slow zones, Buemi was 46 seconds down the road from Britain’s Mike Conway in the other TS050 hybrid.The turnaround also fuelled conspiracy theories that Toyota wanted Alonso to win for the extra publicity value, although the manufacturer has denied any favouritism.The double Formula One world champion and Monaco Grand Prix winner, has made a big play about becoming only the second driver to take the ‘Triple Crown of Motorsport�� and Le Mans is the second piece of the puzzle.The McLaren driver still has to win the Indianapolis 500, a race he led last year before an engine failure, to match the late Graham Hill’s achievement.A Le Mans win could hasten the 36-year-old’s departure from Formula One.Alonso’s chances of Le Mans success had appeared to fade with 14 hours to go when the eight Toyota dropped two minutes behind when Buemi collected a stop-go just after midnight.Toyota are the only major manufacturer competing in the top LMP1 class after champions Porsche quit the World Endurance Championship last year, and have only themselves to beat.Conway other co-driver in the number seven car is Argentina’s Jose Maria Lopez.Rebellion Racing’s number three car remained third overall but 10 laps off the pace.Only one Japanese marque has won before, Mazda in 1991, and Toyota have failed 19 times -- agonisingly last year when their two leading cars retired in a night of drama.In 2016, Nakajima was heading for victory when he slowed with five minutes remaining and came to a halt with victory falling into Porsche’s lap.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it will invest $749 million in five U.S. plants and add 586 jobs as it boosts engine production capacity and adds new hybrid models to its lineup.President Donald Trump has prodded Japanese automakers to add more jobs in the United States as the White House has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles, on the grounds of national security.“All this activity I hope shows that we’re a plus factor to the economic national security of the United States,�� Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told reporters on a conference call. “We believe in America.”Toyota and other automakers have been lobbying heavily to block any new tariffs on imported vehicles.Toyota said it will invest $288 million in Alabama to increase annual engine capacity from 670,000 to 900,000 by the end of 2021 and will add new 4-cylinder and V6 engine lines. It will also invest $238 million in a Kentucky plant to build hybrid versions of the Toyota RAV4 and Lexus ES 300h.Toyota announced last year it would jointly build a new $1.6 billion plant with Mazda Motor Corp in Alabama.Toyota said it will exceed a 2017 pledge to invest $10 billion over five years with a new commitment to reach nearly $13 billion over the same period, including Thursday’s announcement.Toyota President Akio Toyoda will be in Washington Friday to deliver a speech in which he is expected to tout the new investments.Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a “Section 232�� national security report to Trump with recommendations that auto industry officials expect to include at least some tariffs on fully assembled vehicles or on technologies and components related to electric, automated, connected and shared vehicles.Lentz told reporters the automaker is eager to find out the findings, including for the 137,000 Americans he said design, build or sell Toyota vehicles in the United States.“They deserve to know if they’re a security threat,�� he said. “Consumers need to know because they need to understand if their costs for every vehicle they purchase ... is going to go up.”Lentz said the new trade deal the Trump administration has negotiated to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement had played a role in the new investment decisions, but he did not elaborate on how significant that role was.	2.521644112

TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Japanese shares rose on Tuesday as a weaker yen boosted exporters, but volume was thin as many investors were sidelined ahead of high-level China-U.S. talks this week to resolve a damaging trade war.The benchmark Nikkei average rose 1.0% to 21,596.47 by the midday break, while the broader Topix added 0.8% to 1,585.64, with all but one of its 33 subindexes trading in positive territory.Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington this week, but hopes for a deal dimmed on Monday after President Donald Trump said a quick agreement was unlikely.Overnight, the dollar rallied against the yen from a low of 106.55 yen to as high as 107.465 yen, providing a boost for shares of Japanese exporters as a weak yen enhances corporate profits when they are repatriated.Among blue-chip exporters, Toyota Motor Co rose 1.2%, Tokyo Electron advanced 1.6% and Omron Corp added 3.1%.Investor sentiment was also helped by solid starts on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets after a one-week holiday in China.Oil and coal products, metal products and precision machinery were the top three performers in the Tokyo bourse’s 33 sector subindexes, up 2.1%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VW) VOWG_p.DE reported a 4.3 percent rise in 2017 sales to 10.7 million vehicles, staying ahead of Toyota 7203.T in the race to keep the title of world's biggest carmaker although Renault-Nissan RENA.PA has forecast it would go top.Last year’s sales by the German firm, which is still dealing with fallout from a scandal over rigged diesel emissions tests, were its highest ever, helped by strong gains in China, Europe and South America. Monthly sales in December rose 8.5 percent.Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said last month it expected 2017 sales to grow 2 percent to 10.35 million units worldwide across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands. It said it would hit 10.50 million vehicles in 2018.The Renault-Nissan alliance RENA.PA, which includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T, has yet to release combined sales volume figures but Renault boss Carlos Ghosn said in July it was headed for the top spot.In 2016, VW was No. 1 with 10.3 million vehicle sales, Toyota was second with 10.2 million and Renault-Nissan was third with 9.96 million.VW said December 2017 China sales jumped 17.8 percent to 460,100 vehicles, while monthly sales in Europe rose 3.1 percent, driven by Germany. U.S. sales were down 5.2 percent.Overall, carmakers saw European sales fall 4.8 percent in December from the same month a year ago due in part to one less working day, industry data showed on Wednesday.VW has set aside about 25 billion euros ($30 billion) to cover fines, lawsuits and vehicle repairs related to the diesel scandal.	-2.00533795
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in the third quarter were the best in eight years, but mixed September results from leading automakers on Wednesday indicated the industry’s torrid summer pace is slowing.Industry sales in September rose 9 percent, to 1.24 million vehicles, according to research firm Autodata, just missing expectations of nine analysts surveyed by Reuters. The annualized sales rate slowed to 16.4 million, according to Autodata, above last year’s 15.4 million, but well below the 17.5 million pace in August.“The rate of growth in industry sales is beginning to moderate,�� Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said on a conference call. “We are getting closer to what would be a likely plateau in terms of the industry sales pace.”General Motors Co GM.N, Fiat SpA's Chrysler Group FIA.MI, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS all reported year-to-year sales gains on Wednesday, but Ford Motor Co F.N said sales fell slightly from a year ago. And while Toyota's and Honda's sales were up, both companies missed analysts' forecasts.Third-quarter sales were “the best for the industry since 2006,�� said Bill Fay, Toyota division group vice president and general manager.In September, Ford sales fell 3 percent, to 180,175, as the automaker slowed production of the F-150 pickup truck, the best-selling vehicle in America, to prepare for the launch of the redesigned 2015 model. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expected a similar decline.F-150 sales dipped 1 percent, with Ford’s small cars and crossovers showing bigger declines. Ford’s Lincoln brand jumped 13 percent, bolstered by the new MKC compact crossover.GM sales increased 19 percent, to 223,437, about what analysts predicted. The automaker’s full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups soared 47 percent to 66,939. GM’s premium Cadillac brand was flat.Chrysler said sales rose 19 percent, to 169,890. Analysts expected a 17 percent rise. Its Jeep and Ram brands were up 47 percent and 35 percent, respectively, but sales of Jeep Grand Cherokee fell 14 percent.Toyota sales increased 2 percent, to 167,279, but analysts had forecast a 7 percent gain. The company said SUVs and crossovers helped to drive its results. Toyota’s premium Lexus brand was up 7 percent.Honda sales were up 7 percent, to 118,223, versus analysts�� expectations of a 15 percent hike. The mid-size Accord sedan helped drive sales, with a 25 percent gain, but Civic sales dropped 7 percent. Honda’s premium Acura brand was up 14 percent.Nissan sales climbed 19 percent, to 102,955. Analysts looked for a 15 percent increase. The company’s premium Infiniti brand fell 13 percent, while sales of the Nissan Leaf electric car jumped 48 percent.Some analysts were concerned that generous consumer deals, including hefty discounts, low lease rates and zero-percent financing, are stealing demand from the future.Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds.com, the car shopping website, had a different take: “Automakers have struck the right chord by putting more emphasis on leases and opening credit to a larger cross-section of buyers. Expect the same trends to continue through the end of the year.”On Tuesday, reports showed U.S. consumer confidence fell in September for the first time in five months, and home prices in July rose less than expected from a year earlier, underscoring the unsteady nature of U.S. economic growth.	6.568832984

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS on Thursday unveiled its first dedicated gasoline-electric vehicle, becoming one of a handful of automakers to challenge Toyota Motor's 7203.T Prius as low oil prices weigh on demand for fuel-efficient vehicles.Hyundai Motor Senior Vice President Lee Ki-sang said automakers had no choice but to boost green car sales to meet stringent emissions regulations, despite slackening demand as low petrol prices spur the market for gas-guzzling vehicles.“Oil prices could reduce hybrid car sales. But this is the way we have to go,�� Lee told reporters.Hyundai said the compact car, named the IONIQ, achieved fuel economy of 22.4 kms per liter, or 52.7 miles per gallon, in Korea. It would be rolled out in mid-January in its home market at a starting price of about 22.9 million won ($19,145).The latest Prius has not been launched in Korea, but Lee said the IONIQ would beat it for fuel economy in the United States and South Korea.Gasoline-hybrid car market leader Toyota last month trimmed its global sales target for the new Prius to 300,000-350,000 as lower petrol prices hurt demand.Hyundai has so far launched hybrid variants of their existing models like the Sonata and the Azera, but the 1.6-litre IONIQ is the first hybrid-exclusive car it has made from scratch.It is also the first car to offer three electrified versions, including plug-in hybrid and full-electric. Hyundai plans to introduce a plug-in hybrid version late this year after rolling out a pure electric version.Affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS also plans to launch its first hybrid-dedicated model this year.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N and its local partners in China sold a total 99,157 vehicles on a wholesale basis in November, up 47 percent from a year earlier, the company said on Thursday.That compared with a 55 percent increase in October.In the first 11 months of the year, sales by the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker totaled 840,975 vehicles, up 51 percent from the same period last year.Ford, whose sales have been helped by robust demand for models such as the Focus compact car and the Mondeo midsize sedan, is expected to unveil the significantly redesigned Mustang at a media event in Shanghai later on Thursday. The event is part of a global launch of the sporty coupe simultaneously occurring in Dearborn, Barcelona, Los Angeles, New York and Sydney.The company says the new Mustang is one of 15 new or significantly redesigned vehicles Ford is bringing to China by 2015 to keep the growth momentum it began building in recent months after a slow start in the world’s biggest auto market.In China, the American automaker has now overtaken its Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, helped in part by a sales crisis Toyota and other Japanese brands have undergone since late last year in the wake of a surge in anti-Japan sentiment following a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.During the first 11 months of this year, Toyota sold about 809,000 vehicles, up 7.9 percent from a year earlier.Ford has manufacturing and sales joint ventures with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd 000625.SZ and Jiangling Motors Corp 000550.SZ in China.	-2.093856933
Shares in PT Astra Otoparts dropped as much as 5.88 percent on Thursday after its parent company, PT Astra International, announced a stake sale in the automotive spare parts distributor.Astra International, controlled by Singapore’s Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage Ltd, expects to raise 2.8 trillion rupiah ($285.64 million) by selling 15 percent in Astra Otoparts through a private placement, said director Robby Sani.Indonesia’s main vehicle distributor and biggest listed company by market cap will sell 754 million shares at 3,750 rupiah per share, and 5 percent of the stake sale will be bought by Toyota Tsusho Corp.Shares of Astra Otoparts were down 0.59 percent at 4,225 rupiah, while Astra International was up 0.69 percent at 7,250 rupiah.

TOYOTA CITY, Japan (Reuters) - Engineers at Toyota Motor Corp say they have tamed volatile lithium-ion battery technology, and can now safely pack more power at no significant extra cost, giving the Japanese automaker the option to enter the growing all-electric car market.While rivals including Tesla Motors and Nissan Motor Co began adopting lithium-ion battery technology nearly a decade ago, Toyota has largely held back due to concerns over cost, size and safety.Lithium-ion batteries can be unstable and have been blamed for incendiary Samsung smartphones and smoking Dreamliner airplanes.Having Toyota endorse lithium-ion will be a fillip for the developing technology, and gives the automaker the option to produce for an all-electric passenger car market which it has avoided, preferring to put its heft behind hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs).Toyota says its Prius Prime, a soon-to-be-launched plug-in electric version of the world’s top-selling gasoline hybrid, will use lithium-ion batteries, with enough energy to make the car go around 60 kms (37.3 miles) when fully charged before the gasoline engine kicks in. Because of different methodology in measuring a car’s electric mode range, the Prime’s 60 km range will be listed in the United States as around 25 miles (40.2 kms).“SAFETY, SAFETY, SAFETY”Many lithium-ion car batteries use a chemical combination of nickel, cobalt and manganese. These store more energy, take a shorter time to charge, and are considered safer than other Li-ion technologies.But they can still overheat and catch fire if not properly designed, manufactured and controlled.“It’s a tall order to develop a lithium-ion car battery which can perform reliably and safely for 10 years, or over hundreds of thousands of kilometers,�� said Koji Toyoshima, the chief engineer for the Prius.“We have double braced and triple braced our battery pack to make sure they’re fail-safe ... It’s all about safety, safety, safety,�� he told Reuters.Toyota has mainly used the more mature nickel-metal hydride batteries to power the motor in the conventional Prius, widely regarded as the forefather of the ‘green�� car, though it did use some lithium-ion batteries from 2009 in its first plug-in hybrid Prius, around the time the first all-electric cars powered by lithium-ion batteries - such as the Tesla Roadster and Nissan Leaf - came on to the mass market.Toyota’s confidence in its battery’s safety and stability comes from improved control technology that precisely monitors the temperature and condition of each of the 95 cells in its new battery pack.“Our control system can identify even slight signs of a potential short-circuit in individual cells, and will either prevent it from spreading or shut down the entire battery,�� said Hiroaki Takeuchi, a senior Toyota engineer involved in the development.Working with battery supplier Panasonic Corp - which also produces Li-ion batteries for Tesla - Toyota has also improved the precision in battery cell assembly, ensuring battery chemistry is free of impurities.The introduction of even microscopic metal particles or other impurities can trigger a short-circuit, overheating and potential explosion.“The environment where our lithium-ion batteries are produced is not quite like the clean rooms where semiconductors are made, but very close,�� Takeuchi said.Battery experts say increasingly sophisticated systems that can track individual cell conditions are becoming closely-held trade secrets.“State of charge management, safety management and algorithm development is becoming one of the higher tiers of proprietary internal development,�� said Eric Rask, principal research engineer at Argonne National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy facility outside Chicago.“It’s very internal, very strategic, and companies are seeing management algorithms as a competitive advantage.”Toyota has also been able to shrink the size of each cell, for example, closing the distance between the anode and cathode, where active ions travel when charging and discharging.This has doubled battery capacity to around 8.8 kilowatt hours, while only increasing the battery pack size by around two-thirds and its weight by a half.Battery experts say lithium-ion battery cell prices have fallen by about 60 percent in five years to around $145 per kilowatt hour as larger-scale production has made them cheaper to make.Falling battery prices have enabled Toyota to develop its more compact, efficient battery, while also adding more sophisticated controls into its battery pack, Toyoshima said. Toyota declined to say more on its costs.While Toyota sees FCVs as the ultimate ‘green�� car, the United States and China are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies.“Developing lithium-ion batteries for both hybrids and plug-ins will enable us to also produce all-electric cars in the future,�� said Toyoshima said. “It makes sense to have a range of batteries to suit different powertrains.��	2.481411032
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan’s new board member, Yukitoshi Funo, said policymakers must respond flexibly to changes in the economy while trying to achieve a 2 percent inflation target, signaling that he won’t be bound by a rigid time frame for meeting that goal.The former Toyota Motor Corp executive 7203.T also said Japanese firms must boost productivity and become resilient to currency volatility, suggesting that he won't pay heed to calls from the business sector to sway yen moves with monetary policy.Funo said that while achieving the BOJ’s price target is important, the appropriate way to hit the goal may change depending on external factors and changes in the economy.“In corporate jargon, it’s plan, do, check and act,�� Funo told a news conference upon joining the board on Wednesday.“You always need to check your plan against reality when you’re trying to achieve a goal,�� an approach that applies to policymakers too as the economy is a “living thing,�� he said.Funo joins a deeply fragmented board that voted to expand monetary stimulus last October by a 5-4 vote with dissenters openly voicing concern over the drawbacks of topping up an already massive stimulus program.He replaced Yoshihisa Morimoto, a former utility executive who voted against last year’s surprise monetary easing, and his appointment may tilt the board more in favor of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.Funo said the BOJ’s massive stimulus was exerting its intended effect, suggesting that he is unlikely to rock the boat for the time being.“His comments suggest he is supportive of Kuroda’s policy stance,�� said Naomi Muguruma, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley.But Funo added that it was “natural�� to have split votes and differing views on policy within the board, a sign he won’t hesitate to speak up against the governor.Little has been known on Funo’s views on monetary policy.But more than four decades of experience at the auto giant, including heading its crucial U.S. sales operation, may bring a dose of real-world pragmatism to the BOJ, which is embarking on a radical stimulus experiment aimed at changing corporate and household behavior.Funo’s first policy-setting meeting will be on July 14-15, when the board conducts a quarterly review of its long-term economic and price forecasts.Some analysts have speculated that his background as a former Toyota executive suggests he will favor policies that will keep the yen weak and give Japanese exports a competitive advantage overseas.Funo, however, sidestepped a question on whether further yen weakness was negative for the economy or whether he thought further monetary easing was necessary.“Markets determine exchange rates. For that reason, it’s important for Japanese companies, and the economy, to become resilient to exchange-rate volatility,�� he said.	0.3239171375
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to use a Virginia car dealership on Tuesday as the setting to tout its rejection of the Obama administration’s landmark vehicle fuel efficiency rules, a move that could put automakers in the middle of a battle between the Trump administration and California.EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt plans to sign a declaration by Sunday that the Obama administration’s vehicle efficiency rules for 2022 through 2025 are “not appropriate�� and must be revised, Reuters reported last week.Pruitt is expected to speak at an event at a Chevrolet dealership in suburban Washington and will joined by groups representing dealers and automakers, according to people familiar with the plans.The state of California, which has the power to effectively create its own fuel economy standards, several allied states and environmental groups are gearing up for a legal and political fight over the rules, aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks.California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered. Pruitt was in California earlier this week, but did not meet with Nichols.Two administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing specific revisions to existing fuel economy standards and emissions limits remains in flux. EPA officials suggested a detailed proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier proposal, automakers and officials said.The EPA declined Thursday to comment on Pruitt’s plans. An EPA spokeswoman said last week “a final determination will be signed by April 1.”Automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.Auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011. But they have urged Pruitt and U.S. President Donald Trump to revise the Obama standards to make it easier and less costly to meet complex targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks.Overall, the Obama rules called for roughly doubling by 2025 to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States. But the Obama rules included a review by April 2018 as to whether the final years were feasible or not.By declaring the Obama rules “not appropriate,�� the Trump administration can reopen the process of setting vehicle targets agreed to by automakers in 2011.Pruitt is expected to declare that the existing 2022-2025 model year rules on fuel economy must be revised but he is not expected to immediately propose new requirements, people familiar with the plans said. They asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.The so-called Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules sought to double the average fuel efficiency of automakers�� fleets, or complete lineup of cars and light trucks, to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.While automakers want relief from the Obama rules, they are pressing the administration to avoid a battle with California and maintain a single, nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements.In New York, Toyota North America 7203.T Chief Executive Jim Lentz said at an Reuters event on Thursday that automakers would face higher costs if they had to manage fuel economy by each individual state.Lentz said individual state emissions requirements could result in Toyota getting “towards the end of the year and I no longer can sell SUVs,�� depending on the state’s fuel economy numbers. “It would be an absolute nightmare for us to figure out.”When fuel rules were written in 2011 amid high gas prices, fuel efficiency was the second highest attribute considered by Toyota buyers, Lentz said. Today it is 10th.	3.467888459
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday estimated that its new North American trade deal will create 76,000 automotive sector jobs within five years as automakers invest some $34 billion in new plants to comply with the pact’s new regional content rules.The forecasts from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office were released ahead of an independent trade panel’s hotly anticipated analysis that economists expect to show little or no U.S. gains from the new U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement.A USTR official told reporters that the jobs and investment estimates are based on plans disclosed by automakers to the trade agency for compliance with the new agreement’s tighter rules of origin. These require 75 percent of a vehicle’s content to be produced in North American, with 40-45 percent produced in high wage areas, namely the United States or Canada.A senior USTR official told reporters that none of the 15 automakers producing vehicles in North America intend to opt out of the agreement to pay U.S. tariffs instead and move production overseas, as some critics of the deal have suggested.“They have verbally committed to us that they intend to comply with the rules,�� the official said. “And they have told us that this is not going to have significant upward pressure on vehicle prices.”The estimates include about $15.3 billion investments previously announced by Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor, General Motors Toyota Volkswagen and battery maker SK Innovation.	-4.872744845
NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. will restructure its marketing organization in California, the company said on Sunday.Many of Toyota’s more than 5,000 California-based employees are based at a complex outside of Los Angeles that houses the company’s marketing operations, Toyota Motor Sales USA (TMS).A company spokeswoman confirmed the restructuring, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, and said it would be effective May 1.“Roles and responsibilities will be redefined�� to create a more efficient team, the spokeswoman said, and those whose roles have been eliminated can apply for new roles within the reorganized operation, elsewhere in TMS, or at Toyota Financial Services. A voluntary exit program is also available.TMS handles the non-technical and non-manufacturing aspects of the business: sales, service, advertising and public relations.Toyota has a small manufacturing operation in Long Beach, California, as well as vehicle factories in lower-cost states like Kentucky, Indiana, Texas and Mississippi.Until 2006, most Asian auto makers were based in Southern California. In 2006, Nissan moved its headquarters from California to Nashville, Tennessee.It is unclear if this is the first step in a similar move to transition to another state where labor and taxes are lower. A spokeswoman said the company would make a full announcement on Monday.	2.652470347

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Hyundai Motor 005380.KS have risen almost 11 percent this month, while most other global auto brands have fallen - another sign that the South Korean car maker is motoring in the fast lane.From Europe to China, the world’s biggest auto market, Hyundai is shifting more cars while industry sales sputter.In Europe, industry sales dropped 8 percent in the first quarter, but Hyundai posted double-digit sales growth, and is expected to post more gains thanks to new models such as the fully-revamped i30 compact.Hyundai also increased its Chinese sales in January-March, in a market that shrank 1.3 percent, analysts said. [ID:nL3E8FB1U9] Hyundai plans to start production at new plants in China and Brazil this year, after a new factory went into production in Russia last year. It has capped global production capacity at 7 million vehicles, saying it doesn’t want to follow Toyota, once its benchmark, which suffered from a major recall crisis after it ramped up global capacity.In the United States, Ford Motor F.N and others have also upgraded their 2012 sales goals after an unexpectedly strong first quarter as drivers finally put the 2008-09 downturn behind them and began replacing ageing gas guzzlers.The maker of the Sonata sedan and Elantra compact increased its U.S. sales by 15 percent in January-March, edging the overall market’s 14 percent gain, but its market share slipped to 4.7 percent from 5.1 percent as its stretched production capacity meant it couldn’t readily boost output.The world's fifth-biggest automaker, with affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS, is expected to report later on Thursday a 10 percent increase in January-March net profit to 2.07 trillion won ($1.81 billion), according to a consensus forecast by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, on strong overseas sales.Full-year 2012 net profit is forecast at a record $7.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates.“Hyundai’s sales gains in major markets are not slowing,�� said Song Sang-hun, a StarMine top-ranked analyst at Kyobo Securities. “The market was concerned that a weakening yen would help Japanese rivals boost sales and win back market share, but this actually had little impact on Hyundai’s sales in the first quarter.��&lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Hyundai snapshot: r.reuters.com/jev47s^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt;Once derided for its poor quality, boxy cars, Hyundai, under Chairman Chung Mong-koo, has moved up the quality ladder and is envied by rivals as it has outpaced the market by offering stylish models at affordable prices. Its operating margin of around 10.5 percent is more than four times that of Toyota.Hyundai has also taken full competitive advantage of a cheaper South Korean won, but its Japanese rivals are fast recovering from last year’s natural disaster setbacks and should report much improved January-March profits.The current quarter outlook is bright, with strong seasonal demand and the launch of new models including a revamped sleeker-looking Santa Fe sport utility vehicle. Earnings could top last year’s record 2.3 trillion won, according to StarMine SmartEstimates.While Hyundai shares have raced ahead in April, shares of Japan's Toyota Motor 7203.T, Honda Motor 7267.T and Nissan Motor 7201.T have fallen, as have those of Ford, General Motors GM.N and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE.“Hyundai’s profit growth is seen slowing this year after it accelerated in recent years. But compared to other sectors, it will post solid profits, which makes its stock attractive,�� said Jung Sung-man, a fund manager at Plus Asset Management, which owns Hyundai stock.($1 = 1140.8500 Korean won)	-5.841378468
TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Japanese shares fell on Thursday as investors stayed away from risky bets amid a largely downbeat earnings season, though Toyota rose after unexpectedly avoiding a loss last quarter.The Nikkei index ended down 0.43% at 22,418.15, with technology and consumer staples companies falling the most.The broader Topix fell 0.31% to 1,549.88.A series of disappointing earnings and forecasts from companies due to the COVID-19 pandemic have weighed on the Japanese market for the past few sessions.Some analysts argue that the decline in corporate profit has bottomed out and earnings will gradually recover.Others point to the likelihood of additional U.S. economic stimulus and work on developing a COVID-19 vaccine as reasons not to be overly pessimistic.“The earnings from Japan so far have been really bad, but this is the bottom and earnings are not going to get any worse,�� said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.“Any recovery in earnings, regardless of how gradual it is, will be better than this crop of earnings reports.”The underperformers among the top 30 core Topix were Honda Motor Co Ltd down 6.31%, followed by East Japan Railway Co losing 2.47%.Honda fell after the automaker forecast a 68% decrease in annual operating profit and posted its worst quarterly operating loss since the March 2009 quarter.The stocks that gained the most among the Topix 30 names were Toyota Motor Corp up 2.29%, followed by commodities trader Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd.Toyota reported a 13.9 billion yen ($131.73 million) operating profit for the three months ended June, which was its worst in nine years but still better than expectations for a 179 billion yen loss.There were 100 advancers in the Nikkei index against 122 decliners.The volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board was 1.08 billion, compared with the average of 1.2 billion in the past 30 days.

(Recasts with total Canadian auto sales, adds data for GM and Toyota Canada)TORONTO, June 3 (Reuters) - Pent-up demand helped drive Canadian auto sales to a monthly record in May, with mass market brands and niche automakers both big winners, an independent auto industry analyst said on Tuesday.A 12.1 percent surge in truck demand helped lift May vehicle sales by 5.7 percent to 195,571 vehicles, said Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, offsetting a 1.7 percent drop in car sales.“We hold to our fundamental belief that the Canadian market bought light vehicles below its potential, and indeed its need for transportation, for a number of years,�� DesRosiers wrote in a report. “Even though we are in record territory, there is still room to grow, albeit slightly.”May sales were 10,000 units ahead of the previous record set in May 2007 and pushed the seasonally adjusted annual rate to 1.86 million vehicles, he added. Year-to-date sales were up 2.9 percent, to 732,666 vehicles, marking the second-best January-to-May sales period ever.Gains for larger brands were led by Nissan Motor Co’s 28.9 percent jump in sales, the consultant wrote, followed by a 12.4 percent increase at Honda Motor Co Ltd , an 11.8 percent gain at General Motors Co and 8 percent lift at Chrysler.Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd was the country’s top auto seller in May, despite a 2.3 decline in sales to 31,754 vehicles, with Chrysler Canada a close second with 31,498 vehicles.Ford truck sales rose 1.1 percent, but car sales slipped 11.2 percent. So far this year, total sales are down 4.8 percent to 112,265 vehicles.Chrysler Canada said it maintained its position as the country’s top-selling automotive company for 2014, with year-to-date sales up 6 percent at 119,579 vehicles.GM Canada sales rose to 26,444 vehicles, marking its best May since 2009 as truck sales jumped 16.1 percent and car sales climbed 3.8 percent. Year-to-date sales are 1 percent higher at 97,641 vehicles.Monthly sales at Toyota Canada Inc rose 1 percent, to 22,465 vehicles, partly lifted by a 6 percent gain in truck sales, to an all-time record of 9,963 vehicles.Several smaller brands blew by previous sales records, DesRosiers wrote, pointing to a 40.8 percent jump for Land Rover, 38.9 percent sales increase for Jaguar and 32.2 percent climb for Porsche.In the United States, automakers reported higher-than-expected new car sales of 1.6 million in May, with rising consumer demand underpinning a broader economic recovery.The auto industry in May recorded its strongest annual sales rate since before the 2008 recession, as transaction prices remained strong and discounts did not increase.Industry sales rose 11.3 percent to 1,606,264 vehicles.

FRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Volkswagen denied a German magazine report it was bracing for a slump in the economy and had told suppliers it was considering cutting production by 10 percent in the European autumn.“The given scenarios are speculative and factually not correct,�� a spokesman for the German carmaker said on Sunday of the report in Automobilwoche.The spokesman said the situation in some markets was “tense�� and the coming months will be “significantly more difficult and demanding.”Automobilwoche gave no sources for its report.In July, VW reported an increase in first-half deliveries across the multi-brand group of 8.9 percent to 4.45 million autos.The Wolfsburg-based company, Europe’s largest car maker, has a goal of boosting sales to 10 million vehicles by 2018 and to surpass Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors Co as the world’s biggest carmaker.Other European carmakers have ordered temporary shutdowns in response to a protracted sales slump.

(Adds details, comments)BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - China sales by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners rose 68 percent in April from a year earlier to about 81,700 vehicles, according to a company spokesman.For the first four months of the year, the Japanese auto maker sold a total of about 293,200 vehicles, a 14.3 percent increase from the same period last year, said the spokesman, Takanori Yokoi.Yokoi said the large year-on-year jump in April sales was due chiefly to the fact that sales during April last year were comparatively low because of the massive earthquake on March 11. The earthquake and tsunami paralyzed production of key components and affected Toyota’s vehicle production around the world, including China.Still, Toyota’s sales momentum was “fairly strong�� so far this year, said Yokoi. Because the company’s sales performance was so bad last year due to the impact from the earthquake Toyota “should be able to post double-digit sales growth at least for the next several months,�� the Beijing-based spokesman said.“If things go as normally as we expect, we should be able to meet our sales goal�� of selling one million cars this year, said Yokoi.Toyota’s China sales last year totalled about 883,400 vehicles, a 4.4 percent increase from 2010, reflecting in part the general slowdown of automobile sales in China last year.After rapid growth in 2009 and 2010, China’s auto market as a whole slowed considerably last year as sales of smaller-engine cars and commercial vehicles stalled after the government ended some incentives for car buyers.Various industry forecasts point to overall vehicle sales this year growing about 5-10 percent from 2011.Toyota would have to grow sales by about 13 percent this year to meet its goal of selling one million vehicles.

TOKYO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Lexus is aiming for a steady 5 to 10 percent annual growth in the coming years, an executive said, as the luxury brand of the world’s best-selling carmaker Toyota seeks to establish a more global presence in the premium market.The company expects to sell a record 520,000 Lexus vehicles this year, up about 8 percent year-on-year. The United States last year accounted for about half of Lexus�� global sales.Lexus officials say despite the growth, the priority is building a stronger brand image rather than volume.In a drive to boost its image, Lexus on Wednesday named for Akio Toyoda, the President of Toyota Motor Corp, “Chief Branding Officer and Master Driver��. Toyoda is a race driver and a founding family scion.“Right now, he (Toyoda) says sales aren’t important, profits aren’t important, it’s all about building a foundation for the future. So we are trying to build through the next 30 years,�� said Mark Templin, Lexus Executive Vice President, at the Tokyo Motor Show.In April, Toyoda changed the structure of the carmaker and placed Lexus among the four pillars of its core business areas.Since then, he has been at the forefront of promoting the brand, making appearances in hip suits and retro glasses and has said his founding family status puts him in a unique position to promote the luxury cars.Toyoda has also been giving direct orders and suggestions for various Lexus events and sits in a monthly discussion on Lexus marketing strategy, Lexus President Kiyotaka Ise said.Lexus unveiled the new RC coupe and concept compact SUV LF-NX at the Tokyo motor show on Wednesday.

VIENNA, July 14 (Reuters) - German industrial gases maker Linde opened what it said was the world’s first production line for hydrogen fuelling stations on Monday, in a bid to boost support networks for eco-friendly cars.Fuel-cell cars, which compete with electric and hybrid vehicles in a race to capture environmentally conscious drivers, use a stack of cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen in the air to generate electricity.Their only emissions are water vapour and heat, but the technology has been held back by high costs and lack of infrastructure. Fuel-cell cars will go on sale starting at $70,000, and filling stations cost over $1 million to build.On the back of commercial launch announcements by Toyota and Hyundai and demand in Japan, Linde started up a production facility with an initial annual capacity of 50 stations a year. Until now, it has built them one by one.The company announced an order for 28 stations from Japanese gas trading company Iwatani, which put the first of its Linde stations into operation near Osaka on Monday, the first commercial hydrogen fuelling station in Japan.“It’s a chicken-and-egg situation,�� Linde executive board member Aldo Belloni told Reuters on the sidelines of the opening ceremony in Vienna.Belloni declined to say how much Linde had invested since starting its fuel-cell research and development in 1988, centred in Vienna, but said it was “very much��.Fuel-cell cars can run five times longer than electric cars and fill a tank 10 times as fast.But the high costs have prevented a commercial breakthrough until now. Just a few hundred demo models are on the road, mostly in Japan, California, Germany and Scandinavia.“The question is: Will the industry move towards hydrogen fuel cells or electric vehicles? And we think for the foreseeable future, 10 to 20 years, electric vehicles make more sense for the total cost of ownership,�� said Arndt Ellinghorst, head of automotive research at ISI Group.Nonetheless, Daimler, Nissan, Ford , Renault, Honda and General Motors are all developing hydrogen technology, and some have plans to launch commercially in the next few years.Electric cars are far less expensive and can be charged at home or the office as well as on the road. But they can travel only 100 to 200 km (62 to 124 miles) on a single charge, and fully charging the battery takes at least half an hour.“Today is the start of another big step for our future,�� Katsuhiko Hirose, head of Toyota’s hydrogen programme, said at the Linde event in Vienna.

LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - India’s car manufacturers are in deep strife with slumping sales amid a broader slowdown in economic growth, but one element missing in the bearish narrative is a matching drop in crude oil imports.While crude purchases by the world’s third-largest importer have slowed so far this year, it could be argued that they have actually held up well considering the carnage in the country’s vast vehicle manufacturing sector.India’s passenger vehicle sales are likely to have dropped for a tenth consecutive month in August, with commercial vehicle sales also experiencing a slump.August sales data from India’s top six car makers, including Suzuki Motor Corp’s and Toyota Motor Corp’s local businesses, shows that passenger vehicle sales plunged 34% from the same month in 2018. These six manufacturers make up more than 90% share of the market.Data from Tata Motors and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, which together account for about two-thirds of the commercial vehicles market, show that sales of trucks, an indicator of economic activity, fell by almost 40% in August.While crude oil imports are down this year in India, the decline hasn’t been anywhere near as dramatic as for vehicle sales.In the first seven months of the year, crude imports were 4.55 million barrels per day (bpd), down 1.3% from the 4.61 million bpd for the same period in 2018, according to data from shipping and industry sources.Final figures aren’t yet available for August, but Refinitiv vessel-tracking data suggests that a small increase from July’s imports is likely.It’s also worth noting that India’s crude imports are likely to have been somewhat crimped in recent months by the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran.U.S. waivers to eight purchasers of Iranian crude, including India, expired at the start of May, resulting in India importing no cargoes from the Islamic Republic in both June and July.This is a dramatic shift from 2018, when India’s crude imports from Iran were 611,800 bpd in the first seven months of the year, but only 191,600 bpd in the same period this year.While India has increased imports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United States among others, the disruption from having to cease purchases from Iran may well have made imports lower than they otherwise would have been in recent months.It’s also not the case that Indian refiners have been exporting more refined fuels such as diesel and gasoline, with product exports actually rising in July to 5.07 million tonnes from June’s 4.69 million, although they were down slightly from 5.34 million in July 2018.Despite the poor vehicle sales, India’s fuel demand also appears to be holding up, with domestic sales rising 3.3% in July to 17.58 million tonnes from the same month a year ago.This was the biggest percentage increase since January this year and was led by increases in sales of diesel and gasoline, as well as bitumen.The relatively stable crude import and domestic fuel sales data appears to be inconsistent with the weak automotive sector and slowing economic growth, with gross domestic product dropping to a six-year low of 5.0% year-on-year in the second quarter.It’s possible that there is a lag between the crashing vehicle sales, slower economic growth and fuel demand, meaning the impact has yet to show up in crude import figures.This suggests that one of the engines of global crude oil demand growth is likely to splutter in coming months, a further bearish signal for prices.However, it will also be worth monitoring to see if India’s government acts on calls from the automotive sector for tax cuts in order to stimulate demand.But even if the government does act to stimulate demand, it may take some time to work, meaning the risks for India’s crude oil demand are biased to the downside in coming months.	-0.01524738888

(Adds link to report on patents)LAS VEGAS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Automakers, not technology companies, are in the driver’s seat in developing self-driving, “autonomous�� cars, and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp is best positioned to lead the way, according to a new report on patents for the fast-evolving technology.As automakers enter agreements with Silicon Valley companies to develop self-driving cars, Tesla Motor Inc and Apple Inc would make logical partners, the report says.The report, by the Intellectual Property and Science division of Thomson Reuters, is based on a detailed analysis of patent filings by automakers and tech companies for autonomous-car technology. (tmsnrt.rs/1OxPQ3P)The findings illuminate the challenges for both established automakers and Silicon Valley companies as they compete to profit from moving people around in a world that is increasingly congested and concerned about carbon emissions.The global auto industry is in the midst of three simultaneous, and interconnected, technology revolutions. The first is the quest for cleaner alternatives to internal-combustion engines. The second involves connectivity and linking cars to information or data services. Lastly, the autonomy revolution is the effort to develop self-driving cars that could enable services in which electric cars connected to the Web can be summoned to provide rides on demand.“Automakers aren’t as good as technology companies in tooting their own horns,�� Tony Trippe, principal author of the report, told Reuters in an interview. “But when you look at the patent data, the automakers are all over this.”Toyota is, far and away, the global leader in the number of self-driving car patents, the report found. Toyota is followed by Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH, Japan’s Denso Corp , Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and General Motors Co. The tech company with the most autonomous-driving patents, Alphabet Inc’s Google, ranks 26th on the list.The report from the Thomson Reuters unit comes as auto and technology industry executives are gathering at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where alliances to advance autonomous driving and connected vehicles will be central topics.GM said on Monday it will invest $500 million in Lyft Inc as it forges a Detroit-Silicon Valley partnership with the ride-sharing service to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars.Toyota, the Thomson Reuters report found, has more than 1,400 patents on autonomous-driving devices, more than twice as many as any other company. One recent Toyota patent application, for example, is for software that avoids a car’s self-driving system being switched off, and thus defaulting to “manual mode�� in which the driver controls the car, unless the driver intends to turn off the system.The raw number of patents does not necessarily equate to leadership in developing self-driving cars, Trippe said. Non-U.S. companies tend to be more aggressive in filing patent applications than American companies. The quality of patents is also important, since not all are created equal.Another potential limitation of the report is the 18-month lag time between patent filings and when the filings are published for the public.In reality, driverless-car development will require alliances between automakers and technology companies, even though both sides will try to gain the upper hand in partnerships.A Toyota spokesman said the automaker views a fully self-driving car as a long term goal, but one that must wait for autonomous driving systems that never make a mistake. In the meantime, Toyota is accelerating efforts to equip cars with automatic braking and other safety systems that can help avoid crashes.Most experts say fully self-driving vehicles are unlikely to be roaming roads in large numbers for many years yet. Google has been testing self-driving cars since 2009, though, and automakers such as Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit have revealed cars that can travel long distances without human intervention.Trippe said Apple and Tesla would make logical partners in autonomous cars because they have complementary, not duplicative patents. Tesla’s strength is propulsion technology, notably batteries, while Apple’s is in electronic navigation and communication systems.As the race to develop self-driving cars heats up, automakers are also introducing more “semi-autonomous�� driving systems that handle tedious or tricky situations. Audi, for instance, is expected to use the CES show to outline progress on a system that allows cars to pilot themselves in traffic jams at low speeds.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it was considering buying out the rest of minivehicle maker Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T, a $3.1 billion deal at current market prices, but denied a report that it was in partnership talks with Daihatsu rival Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T.Shares in Daihatsu soared 16 percent after being overwhelmed by buy orders for most of the day. Shares in Suzuki jumped 11 percent despite denials from both Toyota and Suzuki. Toyota rose 3.8 percent.Full control of Daihatsu could help Toyota leverage the lower-cost brand better and cut procurement costs for Daihatsu, while capital ties with Suzuki would help the world’s largest automaker make inroads into India where Suzuki commands around half the passenger car market.“We are constantly considering a number of possibilities relating to Daihatsu, such as partnerships or business restructuring, including making the company a fully owned subsidiary,�� Toyota said in a statement, but added that no decisions had been made.Toyota owns 51.2 percent of Daihatsu, which like Suzuki, specialises in 660cc minivehicles, a segment particular to Japan, as well as compact cars.Last year, Daihatsu was the weakest link in the Toyota group, which also includes the Toyota and Lexus brands and truck maker Hino Motors 7205.T.Global sales for Daihatsu slid 13.3 percent in 2015, data on Wednesday showed. That pushed total Toyota group sales 0.8 percent lower to 10.15 million, although the group retained the title of the world’s biggest automaker, beating Volkswagen’s sales of 9.93 million.The Nikkei business daily said that Toyota and Suzuki were discussing ties from a variety of angles, including the possibility of cross-shareholdings as they look to capitalise on demand for compact cars in India and other emerging economies.Some analysts noted that greater control of Daihatsu could be at odds with potential cooperation with Suzuki given that the two minivehicle makers are fierce competitors for the same customers.“I can easily see the Daihatsu brand used in the same way that VW uses Skoda or Renault uses Dacia or Nissan uses Datsun as a low-cost, sub-premium brand to the core brand,�� CLSA senior research analyst Christopher Richter said.“That could be a very effective weapon against Suzuki in places like India ... if I were Suzuki that would sound like a risk to doing business with Toyota.”Still, others noted that a potential Toyota-Suzuki partnership could benefit both automakers.Suzuki, through its control of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS, has a vast distribution network in India that Toyota could greatly benefit from.“Suzuki would meanwhile be getting a stable shareholder in Toyota as well as access to Toyota’s HEV/FCV and other next-generation environmental technologies geared toward future vehicle electrification,�� JPMorgan analysts said in a note.Suzuki is expected, however, to tread carefully with any new tie-ups. It formed a capital alliance with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in early 2010 but relations soon soured, leading to a years-long dispute in an arbitration court that ended last year with the unwinding of their cross-shareholdings.($1 = 118.1000 yen)	-8.827610128
BERLIN (Reuters) - Audi will end its involvement in the prestigious Le Mans sports car race next year after almost two decades to focus on racing electric cars, symbolizing a shift in strategy as parent company Volkswagen battles to recover from an emissions scandal.Audi, which is seeking to boost the share of zero-emission vehicles to at least a quarter of its global sales by 2025, said it will start competing next year in the Formula E electric-car racing championship.“We will conduct the race for the future electronically,�� Chief Executive Rupert Stadler told workers at Audi’s sports car division on Wednesday, according to a statement from the company, citing the biggest transformation in the brand’s history.“As our production cars are becoming increasingly electric, our motorsport cars, as Audi’s technological spearheads, have to even more so,�� the CEO said.As it grapples with the costs of the emissions scandal, the German carmaker is cutting spending to fund its shift to electric cars and autonomous driving, mirroring plans by parent VW VOWG_p.DE.Audi denied a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper that savings from pulling out of Le Mans and the World Endurance Championship (WEC) would amount to an annual 300 million euros ($328 million). A source at Audi said the move would save Audi nearly 100 million euros per year.VW’s flagship luxury division has set aside more than half a billion euros to cover costs for the diesel emissions scandal and possible recalls of cars fitted with Takata Corp airbags. Third-quarter financial results are due on Friday.Le Mans, one of the greatest tests of endurance for cars and drivers, has been a source of prestige for Audi which has won the race 13 times in 18 years.The decision to exit the WEC means Audi will be left with no diesel engines in motorsports, a spokesman said.It also leaves the WEC with just two manufacturers competing for the championship: Audi's VW stablemate Porsche PSHG_p.DE, which has won for the past two years with hybrid models, and Toyota.Toyota said in a statement that it noted Audi’s decision “with regret�� but it would have no effect on the company’s plans.“We are preparing for 2017 when we will return with the target of winning the Le Mans 24 Hours and the World Championship,�� a spokesman for the Japanese company said.A Porsche spokesman said it also had no plans to quit.More than a year after VW admitted to rigging emissions tests, Audi’s move is another setback for diesel which analysts have said faces higher costs amid tougher standards and testing methods.But Audi said its exit from top-level sportscar racing does not imply diesel technology will disappear in its road cars.“If we are serious about achieving carbon dioxide (CO2) emission targets, then there is no alternative to diesel because they are the most efficient engines,�� the spokesman said.Audi will continue to compete in Germany’s DTM touring car championship where it will switch from an 8-cylinder to a 4-cylinder petrol-drive car in 2018.Separately, Audi is looking at the possibility of expanding its engagement in the RX World Rallycross championship where it may replace its 4-cylinder petrol model with an electric model, a spokesman said.Audi’s decision is also a boost for Formula E, which has attracted interest from other manufacturers including German rivals BMW and Mercedes as well as Renault, Jaguar, Citroen and India’s Mahindra.“I was as surprised as anyone, probably,�� Formula E Chief Executive Alejandro Agag told Reuters. “It is confirmation that Formula E is going in the right direction.��	2.43796256
TOKYO (Reuters) - Some of Japan’s top automakers, with a reputation for quality performance wrapped in often bland design, are turning to the country’s pop culture to give them “J-factor�� and help set them apart in a world of increasingly look-alike cars.Designers of Nissan Motor’s GT-R supercar, for example, borrowed from the popular “Gundam�� sci-fi anime franchise to give the pug-nosed $100,000 model a mechanical, robot-like appearance, with a squared off rear and round tail lamps.“Take a look at the car’s window and roof line. It doesn’t flow smoothly from front to rear, it’s bent. We wanted to express the awkward but cool, powerful shape of the Japanese anime robot,�� global design chief Shiro Nakamura told Reuters.“We wanted to set us apart from Porsche, Ferrari and other supercars, which are designed to mimic the streamlined beauty of a hunting animal, like a jaguar.”Nakamura, who has also designed for General Motors and Isuzu Motors, wants Japanese cultural aesthetics to help Nissan cars stand out from the crowd, noting that “globally, cars from the mainstream brands have started to look more and more alike.”�We stress Japan because we’re a Japanese brand,�� he added. “Unless you derive design and styling from your own cultural DNA, there’s no chance for continuity, and you lack confidence.”Nissan and others hope that efforts such as these can help them differentiate in a market where so many of today’s cars are difficult to tell apart.“Efficiencies of mass production, economies of scale, brand globalization, a risk-averse corporate culture, a car’s ergonomics, and infrastructure and regulatory constraints all play into this phenomenon,�� said Richard Kong, managing partner at Montaag, a California-based design firm, who was previously a chief designer at Ford’s Lincoln brand and also worked at BMW’s design subsidiary.Others, too, are searching for that J-factor.At Toyota Motor, the front grille and angled LED headlamps on the latest version of the hybrid Prius C are said to make the hatchback look a little like Pikachu, the tough but cuddly hero of “Pokemon��, another popular, long-running Japanese anime series.However, Toyota’s global design chief Tokuo Fukuichi said the resemblance was not necessarily intended, and was more to do with engineers�� efforts to improve the car’s aerodynamics.For Toyota, and especially its premium Lexus brand, the J-factor is more in the car’s functionality than its styling, Fukuichi said: “the way the doors open and shut and how knobs and switches and the steering wheel feel when you touch them.”�Ahead of how the car looks we try to put the importance of visibility to reduce blind spots, for example. We stress the craftsmanship. That’s our DNA and J-factor,�� he said, referencing a national culture where a bullet train stops at the platform within just 10 cms of where it should, and the conductor apologizes if the train is 30 seconds late.At Nissan, Nakamura has experimented with a modern interpretation of Japanese pop culture’s affinity for cuteness.He says he has been told that the Nissan Juke, a mini-SUV, looks not unlike Monkey D. Luffy, a piratical lead character with a large grin in Japanese anime “One Piece��. He says he has no issues with this, though any likeness was unintended.“That ... cutesiness is also Japanese pop culture DNA (that) we try to convey in some of our cars while keeping them modern,�� Nakamura said, referencing also the Cube microvan, which is boxy and squat but has a modern look and an asymmetrical wraparound rear window.“Symmetry is a Western concept,�� he said. “Japanese are more comfortable with imbalance.��	-4.043872198
PRAGUE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Production at TPCA, the Czech car assembly plant jointly owned by Toyota Motor Corp and PSA Peugeot Citroen, is likely to drop to around 200,000 vehicles this year from 215,000 in 2012, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.While the Czech Republic’s other two car plants have been increasing output or running at full capacity in recent months, TPCA, with its portfolio of small cars, is suffering more from poor European sales.“Currently we are expecting (production) at up to 200,000 this year,�� TPCA spokesman Radek Knava said.“The drop in the European market is similar and the situation for the small car segment is that volumes are decreasing.”Some Western European car markets are seeing their weakest year in two decades.TPCA, which makes the Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroen C1 cars, has seen production decline since reaching a record 332,489 vehicles in 2009.Knava said 2013 could be the bottom of the cycle, and that output was likely to be steady or slightly higher next year.Overall, Czech automobile production, including buses and trucks, is set to fall 4-5 percent this year, CTK news agency reported on Wednesday, citing an industry association official. The drop is mainly due to lost capacity in truck production.Volkswagen’s Czech unit Skoda Auto boosted car sales by 3.3 percent to 86,600 vehicles in September, with the launch of new models helping to arrest a decline seen since the start of the year.The third Czech car plant, belonging to South Korea’s Hyundai Motor, is expected to produce 300,000 cars in 2013, keeping production at full capacity in the coming years. It has kept output up by diverting exports to markets outside of Europe.The Czech economy is highly reliant on exports, mainly cars, and is just now exiting a record six-quarter recession.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean automakers face a major headwind from a weakening Japanese yen, which will boost rivals like Toyota Motor Corp. 7203.T next year, a Hyundai Motor 005380.KS think tank said.The fall in the yen will intensify competition in major markets, such as China and the United States, where overall demand is expected to shrink in 2018, the think tank said.It projected that the Korean won would fetch 978 per 100 yen next year, compared with 1,018 this year.The re-election in November of Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who favors massive monetary and fiscal stimulus policies, should point to further yen weakness, the think tank said.Toyota Motor in November raised its forecast for full-year operating profit, in part due to expectations of a weaker yen, which can make goods exported from Japan cheaper and can boost the value of overseas profits when they are repatriated.“The currency environment is expected to deteriorate next year,�� Lee Bo-sung, a director of the think tank, the Global Business Intelligence Center, said at a press briefing on Friday. The contents of the briefing were embargoed until 9 am Sunday Seoul time (0000 GMT).“The weaker yen is expected to be the biggest challenge for South Korean automakers next year, as they are competing against Japanese,�� Lee said.He said the price gap between Korean and Japanese cars had already narrowed due to the yen's decline. For example, Hyundai's Sonata sedan was 10 percent cheaper than Honda's 7267.T Accord in the United States in 2011 and the gap is only 2 percent this year, he said.A weaker yen and higher profit have also allowed Japanese carmakers to boost investment and gain market share in China and other emerging markets, Hyundai’s stronghold, he said.Hyundai Motor has seen its net profit tumble by nearly one-third so far this year, and is on track to miss its annual vehicle sales target by a large margin, having failed to position for a consumer swing to sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and a diplomatic row with Beijing that hit Korean-made products.Hyundai Motor said on Friday it plans to roll out three SUVs next year in the United States - the redesigned Santa Fe, the Kona, and the tweaked Tucson, to revive its sales momentum. In China next year, Hyundai and Kia plan to release three China-targeted small SUVs next year.	7.899620754
* To invest 8.2 bln baht this year despite 2011 floods* Total Thai auto sales seen up 38.5 pct in 2012 - Toyota* Bearing firm Minebea also shows confidence in ThailandBANGKOK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it would spend 8.2 billion baht ($257 million) on investment in Thailand, showing its confidence in the Southeast Asian car sector hub despite floods last year that caused severe disruption to the sector.The Japanese car maker is building a manufacturing plant at Gateway industrial park and restarting a production line at its Thai Auto Works (TAW) plant, where its Fortuners were produced, Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Motor Thai unit, told a briefing.“The reason we invest more is simply because we’re not producing enough,�� Tanada said.The combined production capacity of the two new Toyota plants would be 88,000 units, he said, expecting the Gateway plant in Chachoengsao province to be ready for production in July 2013.It will produce passenger cars as well as environmentally friendly “eco cars��, he said. The TAW plant in Samut Prakan province, which was closed in May 2010 after a drop in demand, would be able to start in December of this year, he said.“We won’t move anywhere. I’ll let the Thai government work with JICA to solve the flood problems. I’m full of hope and confidence for both,�� he said, referring to Japan International Cooperation Agency.Despite the flood that hit the industry hard in the fourth quarter, analysts say Japanese car makers would continue to shift production to Thailand to take advantage of low costs.Tanada said production losses for Toyota from the tsunami in Japan and the Thai flood amounted to 200,000 vehicles in 2011.Japan’s Minebea Co Ltd also said on Tuesday it would invest $75 million to build a new plant in Thailand in the second half of this year despite suffering from the floods.The bearing manufacturer said its two existing plants should restart in February and April.Toyota, in Thailand for five decades, expects total Thai auto sales to rise 38.5 percent to 1.1 million in 2012, recovering from a drop of 0.8 percent last year thanks to new models plus supportive government policies, Tanada said.For Toyota itself, 2012 sales are projected to increase 55.1 percent to 450,000 units for a 40.9 percent market share, against an 11 percent drop to 290,061 units in 2011, with sales of passenger cars falling 2.6 percent to 138,104.“There is still very high demand in Thailand’s automotive market and the demand is likely to increase in 2012,�� Tanada said.The forecast relates to 214,000 passenger cars and 236,000 commercial vehicles, the latter including 214,000 1-tonne pickup trucks.Japanese car makers suffered big disruptions to their supply chain both from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami at home and the floods in Thailand, leading to a plunge in production, sales and inventory in many markets.Car sales in Thailand in December fell 41.4 percent to 54,575 units, led by a 60.2 percent drop for Toyota.Analysts say Thailand’s automobile market is expected to recover strongly in 2012, helped by tax rebates for first-time car buyers and pent-up demand as the industry recovers from the floods.

ISTANBUL, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Turkish car wheel manufacturer CMS Group is looking to sell a stake in itself, possibly a majority stake, and has mandated HSBC to advise on a potential transaction, two people familiar with the matter said. Privately held CMS supplies wheels for 22 automobile brands including BMW, Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen. CMS says it is Turkey’s largest manufacturer of aluminum alloy wheels and Europe’s third-largest.“HSBC has been mandated. The buyer may be a fund,�� one of the sources told Reuters. Both of the sources declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.CMS and HSBC both declined to comment.“The company needs to have a foreign partner in order to grow, to be able to compete with big players,�� said an automotive sector source who is not related to the deal.CMS revenues, mostly exports, amounted to 1.2 billion lira ($328 million) in 2016 and the company expects revenues to rise to 1.4 billion lira this year.CMS produces 9 million aluminum alloy wheels per year at its current production facility in Izmir, western Turkey, and plans to increase production to 12 million by 2022.

FRANKFURT, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Volkswagen plans to invest 1 billion euros ($1.30 billion) to build a new manufacturing plant to produce fuel efficient cars in Thailand, a German magazine said on Saturday.The Thai government is expected to grant Volkswagen approval for the plant on Tuesday, Wirtschaftswoche magazine reported, without citing sources.The plant, which will build 1.4 litre petrol engine cars and which could turn out up to 300,000 vehicles per year at full capacity, is due to go on line by 2019, the magazine said, adding that part of the production would be destined for other markets in the region.A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment on the report.Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in April the company had applied to build its first plant in Thailand, seeking to take advantage of tax breaks that had already attracted investment from Ford and General Motors.Volkswagen already produces its Passat, Polo and Jetta models in Malaysia in conjunction with a local partner, while a new plant in Indonesia will take advantage of growing demand there.VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn has repeatedly said that his company needed to expand its presence in southeast Asia if it is to achieve its goal of unseating Toyota as global market leader.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's BMW BMWG.DE said it saw strong demand for the i8 hybrid sportscar which will go into series production in April and start customer deliveries in June.“Demand for the BMW i8 is already exceeding the planned production volume during ramp-up,�� BMW said in a statement on Monday, without giving a more specific figure for how many cars will be made during this phase.Green cars, and electric vehicles in particular remain a niche product, because their limited vehicle range limits their use when compared with gasoline or diesel-powered cars.Market leader Nissan 7201.T, Toyota 7203.T, General Motors GM.N and VW's VOWG_p.DE Audi have trimmed electric-car plans or have had to offer aggressive pricing to spur their middling sales.To give the carbon fiber car an operating range of up to 600 kilometers (373 miles), the 362-horsepower i8 is powered by a hybrid system.This combines a 96 kilowatt electric motor driving the front wheels, and a turbo charged 231-horsepower three-cylinder petrol engine.	-8.06508981
KARIYA, Japan (Reuters) - Denso Corp 6902.T said a full buy out by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T of its mini-vehicle unit Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T was a chance for Japan's largest auto supplier to expand its product portfolio by making more parts for smaller vehicles.Toyota is in the process of making Daihatsu a fully owned division to strengthen its push into compact cars for emerging markets. Denso is Toyota’s largest supplier, and counts the automaker group as its biggest customer.In an interview with Reuters, Denso President and CEO Koji Arima said the buy out may result in the development of smaller cars with more specialized features, or an increase in Daihatsu branded vehicles which utilize Toyota technology.“If this is the case, there could be opportunities for us to increase the range of parts we supply to both companies,�� Arima said in the interview conducted last week at the company’s headquarters in central Japan.“For example, there could be an chance for us to develop parts for both mini-vehicles and compact cars. This would be a way for use to raise volumes and lower development costs.”In past years, Daihatsu, which makes smaller, lower-priced vehicles than Toyota largely for Japanese and Asian markets, has been sourcing more lower-cost parts from non-Toyota group suppliers to bring down its costs.	-7.352256864
TOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp posted a 10 percent rise in first-quarter net profit on Tuesday, beating analyst estimates, as costs cuts and currency gains made up for weaker global vehicle sales.April-June profit reached 646.39 billion yen ($5.22 billion) versus the 607.5 billion yen average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.The Japanese automaker left its net profit forecast for the year ending March unchanged at 2.25 trillion yen.

(Adds detail on car damage, background)TOKYO, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Saturday its operations near the Chinese port of Tianjin will remain shut at least through Wednesday due to safety concerns as fires continue to break out at the site of last week’s deadly chemical explosions.“We will only restart operations when we have been able to confirm the safety of our facilities and their surroundings, and when our employees feel that they can once again go to work in a safe environment,�� the company said in an email.Toyota also said about 4,700 Toyota and Lexus vehicles were damaged by the Tianjin disaster. It will not sell these cars, which have dents and broken windows, it said.The move to prolong the closure comes as continuing safety hazards cast doubts on when operations can resume in the area.Toyota’s Tianjin operations were originally set to be closed through Wednesday last week but that was then extended through Saturday. The automaker operates two assembly lines near the Tianjin port and another line in a different part of the city.Toyota also said Sichuan FAS Toyota Motor Co Ltd, a joint venture, began operating its Changchun plant on Saturday as planned to make up for lost output. The plant in northeast China was closed through Friday because damages at the port had delayed custom clearance of parts shipped from Japan. (Editing by David Clarke)	3.576462297

March 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Canadian unit, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada, said it will invest C$80 million to increase production of its RAV4 sports utility vehicles at its Woodstock, Ontario, assembly plant, adding 400 jobs.The plant’s RAV4 production capacity will be expanded to 200,000 units per year in early 2013 from 150,000 units at present.Ray Tanguay, chairman of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada, said strong sales of the RAV4 in North America led to the decision to increase production.Toyota also produces the Toyota Corolla, Toyota Matrix and the Lexus RX 350 in Canada.It has two manufacturing plants in Cambridge and one plant in Woodstock and employs 6,500 people in the country.	-4.97327446
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of lawsuits against Takata Corp and several car manufacturers over faulty air bags that prompted a wave of recalls will be heard in a Florida federal court, a judicial panel has ruled.U.S. District Judge Frederico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida will preside over the cases, according to a ruling Thursday from the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The panel considers requests to consolidate related lawsuits in U.S. federal courts.More than 70 proposed class actions have been filed in the past few months by customers who say Takata air bags are defective and can violently explode and spray metal debris, putting passengers at risk of injury or death.Some of the lawsuits name as defendants several automakers, including Honda Motor Co, BMW, Ford Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Subaru Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp.The lawsuits say Takata and the automakers knew about the air bag problems for years, but until recently, failed to recall the cars or warn customers and safety regulators.Plaintiffs are seeking economic damages, such as lost resale value. There are also at least 10 state and federal personal-injury lawsuits involving the air bags.Takata’s air bag inflators have been found to explode too forcefully, and the problem has prompted automakers to recall nearly 25 million vehicles worldwide since 2008. The air bags have also been linked to six deaths, all in Honda cars.Plaintiffs�� lawyers, Takata and the automakers had all agreed that the cases should be consolidated to coordinate pre-trial proceedings but disagreed on the venue.Many of the plaintiffs supported Florida, while Takata and six automakers had asked to move the cases to Pittsburgh, which they said was more centrally located.Honda said in a statement that it respected the panel’s decision and looked forward to proceedings before the Miami court.A lead plaintiff’s lawyer who moved to transfer the cases to Florida and officials from BMW were not immediately available for comment. Takata, Ford, Nissan, Toyota and Subaru declined to comment.	4.82347476

(Repeats urgent after correction in alert)TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will recall 6.58 million vehicles globally to fix faults in the steering and seats, a company draft statement showed on Wednesday, in one of the largest recalls to date in the global auto industry.The world’s biggest automaker is recalling certain Yaris, Urban Cruiser, RAV4 and Hilux models after identifying faults in the steering column, wiring harnesses and seat railings of 1,058 vehicles. The Yaris is also sold as the Vitz and the Urban Cruiser under the Scion brand as the xA.The recall tally was preliminary and subject to review until a formal announcement in Japan later on Wednesday, a Toyota representative said.The recall covers models of the Yaris subcompact and Urban Cruiser SUVs assembled between January 2005 and August 2010 as well as RAV4 SUVs and Hilux compact pickups made between June 2004 and December 2010, Toyota said in the statement.It said 825,000 of the affected vehicles were in Europe but that it was not aware of any accidents related to these faults.It was not immediately clear if the faults were due to design or manufacturing issues.

LONDON (Reuters) - Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota and Kia on Friday became the latest carmakers to launch their own scrappage schemes in Britain, as sales slide, saying they aimed to get motorists to trade in their old cars for less polluting new models.New car registrations fell for the fourth month in a row in July, the longest run of declines since 2011, as demand cools due to faltering consumer confidence ahead of Brexit and uncertainty over whether the government will impose new penalties on drivers of the most-polluting vehicles.VW VOWG_p.DE said it will offer discounts of up to 6,000 pounds ($7,760) on a new car if drivers trade in an older vehicle. Meanwhile Toyota 7203.T said motorists could save up to 4,000 pounds under its new scrappage scheme, Nissan 7201.T is offering a maximum discount of 5,000 pounds and Kia 000270.KS 2,000 pounds. The firms join Ford F.N, BMW BMWG.DE, Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE and Vauxhall, who have all announced similar schemes in recent weeks, together accounting for around two thirds of the new car market in Britain. Carmakers are keen to promote their green credentials in the wake of the VW emissions scandal but sales in September, one of only two occasions each year when a new licence plate series is introduced to indicate the age of the car, normally account for nearly 20 percent of full-year demand in Britain.“Most of them (the trade-in schemes) are renamed marketing campaigns ... so I think it’s mostly a matter of spurring demand in the UK,�� Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst told Reuters.“The market is at an historically high level so the intensity of competition naturally increases and these sales departments want to protect some of their volumes,�� he said.VW’s scheme comes nearly two years since the firm admitted to cheating diesel pollution tests with the use of manipulated engine management software, subjecting it and the industry to intense pressure to cut pollution.Carmakers had been hoping for a British government-backed scrappage scheme, which would be the first since 2009, when ministers intervened to support car sales as they nose-dived in the wake of the financial crisis.But in July the government once again delayed a decision over whether to introduce a nationwide or targeted programme, with a consultation due to take place later this year, despite worries over emissions levels.	5.007921141

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Japans’s Suzuki Motor Corp will start testing prototypes of electric vehicles in India by October, its chairman said on Friday.“We will start road-running tests using a fleet of 50 EV prototype vehicles in India from next month in order to develop safe and easy-to-use EVs for Indian customers,�� Osamu Suzuki said at the Global Mobility Summit at New Delhi.The company would launch EVs in India around 2020 in cooperation with Toyota Motor Corp, he added.However, Suzuki said that for EVs to become popular in India there had to be well-developed charging infrastructure.“In this regard, we look forward to proactive leadership from the Indian government,�� he said.The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a plan to electrify all new vehicles by 2030, a target many experts call ambitious.EVs are expensive due to the high cost of batteries which are still not manufactured in India, and carmakers say a lack of charging stations could make the proposition unviable.The parent of India’s top-selling automaker, Maruti Suzuki Ltd, would start production of lithium-ion batteries for automobiles at its plant in western India from 2020, Suzuki said.India is one of the world’s fastest-growing car markets, but EV sales are negligible compared with millions of petrol and diesel cars sold every year.Suzuki said to meet environmental challenges, India would have to look at hybrid and CNG (compressed natural gas) vehicles also.	2.131230072
(Recasts and adds Honda sales)* Nissan sales up 22.2 pct, Honda up 22 pct* Toyota up 23.5 pct* Figures skewed by Chinese New Year holiday* Impact of anti-Japan protests has been on the waneFeb 4 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd and other Japanese carmakers saw their China car sales improve in January but figures were skewed due to weak holiday-hit sales a year earlier and questions still hang over progress made since anti-Japan protests last year.Showroom traffic in the world’s largest auto market slows dramatically during China’s Lunar New Year holiday, a week-long break that fell in January last year but starts on Feb. 9 this year.That calendar mismatch helped Nissan and Honda Motor Co join Toyota Motor Corp in reporting double-digit climbs in January sales, the first rise since a territorial row over islands in the East China Sea sent sales tumbling in September.Nissan said sales jumped 22.2 percent in January to 115,700 vehicles, while Honda’s increased 22 percent. Toyota, which reported on Friday, logged a 23.5 percent rise.Even without the calendar impact, though, the effect of the territorial row has waned, with the pace of declines in December much less than drops of almost half seen in September and October, helped by generous incentives.“Given the difference in the number of working days between this year and last due to the Spring Festival, there is a need to compare the January-February figure. That said, we think the situation is improving compared with a month ago,�� Nissan said in an emailed statement.A Toyota executive said last month that showroom traffic in China was recovering to levels seen before the crisis and at a pace faster than expected.Other automakers have been more downbeat, with Mazda’s China Chief Noriaki Yamada saying in November that he expected first-quarter sales to slide by about a fifth from year-earlier levels but that the impact of the row should fade by the end of March.After years of breakneck expansion, China vehicles sales have lost some steam, climbing 4.3 percent to 19.3 million in 2012. This year, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers estimates growth of 7 percent. (Reporting by Fang Yan in BEIJING and Kazunori Takada in SHANGHAI; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)	4.450738418
"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O stock jumped above $1,000 a share on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk told his staff it was time to bring the Tesla Semi commercial truck to ""volume production."" Musk, in an email seen by Reuters on Wednesday, did not specify a time frame for ramping up production of the Semi. Musk on Wednesday tweeted “Yes�� to a question on Twitter about whether the report of the leaked Semi truck production email was accurate.Tesla's shares rose about 6% to hit $1,000 on Wednesday after Reuters reported Musk's email, making the Silicon Valley company the second-most valuable automaker in the world, behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. Tesla's share surge could position Musk for another payout from a stock compensation plan tied to the company's market capitalization.The stock also got a boost from a bullish call by Wedbush, which lifted its target price for the automaker to $1,000 and said Tesla could have “more room to run.”Investors also are anticipating Musk will unveil new “million-mile�� battery technology that could deliver longer life, lower costs and better range for future Tesla vehicles.“Production of the battery and powertrain will take place at Giga Nevada,�� Musk wrote. Most of the other work will probably take place in other states, he wrote, without stating where.Musk has said Tesla is scouting other U.S. states for a site to build a new factory, hinting that Texas could be a candidate. Oklahoma and other states are campaigning for the investment.When Musk unveiled the prototype of the futuristic, battery-powered Semi in 2017, he said the Class 8 truck would go into production by 2019. More recently, he said the Semi would go into volume production by 2021.Musk's Tuesday message coincides with a surge in the share price of rival clean truck maker Nikola Corp NKLA.O. Nikola, an electric and fuel cell truck startup, earlier this month began trading on the NASDAQ after it merged with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ.Shares in Nikola have more than doubled in price over the past week as the company’s CEO has used Twitter and interviews to promote plans to launch an electric pickup truck to Tesla’s forthcoming Cybertruck.Nikola and CNH Industrial’s IVECO commercial truck operation last year formed a joint venture to build a battery electric and fuel cell truck line called the Nikola Tre. IVECO has said orders are strong for the electric version of the truck, due out next year.Nikola on Wednesday said it had hired a former Tesla executive, Mark Duchesne, to lead its manufacturing and a former Caterpillar CAT.N executive, Pablo Koziner, to head its hydrogen fueling and battery recharging business."	0.4901960784
TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Saturday it will not use air bag inflators made by Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp in its cars.Nissan joins most major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, that decided to stop using Takata’s inflators that have led to extensive recalls around the world.“We have decided to no longer use (Takata’s) inflators containing ammonium nitrate in airbags for future models,�� Nissan said in a statement.“We will continue to put our customers�� safety first and work to replace the inflators in vehicles under recall as quickly as possible,�� it said.U.S. auto safety regulators have said Takata’s inflators containing ammonium nitrate may cause air bags to explode with excessive force, spraying shrapnel in the vehicle.More than 30 million cars have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over the Takata air bag inflators. Defective inflators have been linked to eight deaths and more than 100 injuries.Nissan said on Monday it would carry out a repeat inspection of vehicles in Japan which had initially been cleared of airbag defects after a passenger was injured when her Takata airbag deployed during a collision last week.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - When Japanese firm Iris Ohyama agreed in April to begin producing much-needed face masks in Japan, it marked a win for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who wants to bring manufacturing back from China.Spooked by coronavirus-induced factory shutdowns in China, Abe’s government has earmarked $2 billion to help companies shift production home. The policy, part of a massive stimulus package to cope with the pandemic, has even been termed by some bureaucrats as a matter of national security.“We have become dependent on China,�� Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters last week. “We need to make supply chains more robust and diverse, broadening our supply sources and increasing domestic production.”Japanese production of masks, for which domestic demand has skyrocketed, makes sense. But Iris Ohyama, which until this month had only made face masks in China, is so far the only large firm known to be taking advantage of the subsidies.Many other Japanese firms say shifting output back home is simply impractical and uneconomical. They need to be physically present in China because much of what they are making is ultimately for the Chinese consumer, and to meet the demands of ‘just-in-time�� production which prioritises short delivery times for efficient manufacturing.""The parts we make are so big that we need to be near our customers to control our costs,"" said Chikara Haruta, a spokesman at Yorozu Corp 7294.T, which makes suspension and other auto components.Its plant in Wuhan, China is located just seven kilometres from a Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T assembly factory.For Japan’s car makers, reliance on Chinese suppliers in the world’s biggest auto market is also just good business.“Even if we wanted to, it would be difficult to lower our exposure to China-made parts,�� an executive at a Japanese automaker told Reuters, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.He added that over the past decade, Chinese suppliers had upped their game and now provide a vast range of quality, low-cost parts.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and Honda also have at least three R&amp;D centres each in China, and their suppliers are following suit.“Where the software is developed dictates where the hardware is developed and made,�� said an official at a Japanese parts supplier, speaking on condition of anonymity.“The new government incentive is misguided if it only focuses on bringing manufacturing back, while overlooking R&amp;D functions.”Japanese politicians have increasingly fretted over Japan’s dependence on China as a production hub.Since the early 2000s as Chinese labour costs rose, there has been talk of a “China Plus One�� strategy �� a policy of managing risk by locating plants and facilities in China and one other Asian nation. It gained more traction in 2012 when bilateral tensions flared and many Japanese firms have sought to diversify with operations in Southeast Asia.The near total shutdown of China’s factories in February as the world’s No. 2 economy sought to stamp out the coronavirus has, however, rammed Japan’s China dependence home.The government’s 220 billion yen ($2 billion) allocation is the first time it has offered subsidies for bringing back manufacturing. It is also offering 23.5 billion yen to Japanese firms to strengthen and diversify supply chains in Southeast Asia.Japanese firms had at least 7,400 affiliates in China as of March 2018, according to a trade ministry survey, up 60% from 2008. In the same year, Japanese manufacturing affiliates in China sold $252 billion in goods, with 73% of that sold in China and 17% exported back home, a separate survey by the ministry shows.For a graphic on Japanese companies in China, please click tmsnrt.rs/2Ubu7aPElectronics makers too say they would struggle to sever ties with China’s supply chains.Nidec Corp 6594.T, which produces motors for electronic goods, even said in April it needed to improve its supply chain in China. It was unable to procure supplies of a basic part this year which it had believed was sourced locally but was in fact being shipped from Europe.“We need to strengthen sourcing capabilities at our Chinese plants. We should be producing these sorts of parts in-house,�� CEO Shigenobu Nagamori told reporters.Japan Display Inc 6740.T and chipmaker Rohm Co Ltd 6963.T say potential shifts to full automation for labour-intensive back-end processes done overseas could lead to new assembly lines being built at home where more advanced manufacturing takes place. But for many others, China remains the cheaper option.Display panel and television maker Sharp Corp 6753.T produces ultra-thin panel cells in Japan, which are shipped to China where backlights, connectors and other parts are added - a process that requires constant manual testing and machinery adjustments. ""The back-end process has long been done in China because it's labour intensive,"" said a spokesman at Sharp, which was acquired by Taiwan's Foxconn 2317.TW in 2016.“It would be expensive to bring it back home.��"	-5.176506624

A Nissan spokesman declined to confirm the report.Toyota and Honda plan to cut China production to about half normal levels by shortening working hours and slowing down the speed of production lines, the Nikkei said without citing a source.A Honda spokeswoman said she was checking the report.A Toyota spokesman could not confirm the details of the report, saying that plants in China were operating again as planned after the country’s national holiday period last week and that production was taking placed based on market demand.Toyota’s China sales fell about 40 percent in September from a year before to about 50,000 cars, a senior company executive told Reuters last week. The firm is set to officially release its September China sales figures on Tuesday.The Nikkei report did not say how long the output cuts would last.A spokeswoman for Mazda, which halted production for two extra days in late September before it shutdown factories during the holiday season, said plants in China were operating again but declined to comment on details.A spokesman for Suzuki Motor Corp, which in late September had stopped one of two shifts that it normally runs in China ahead of the holiday season, said production was now back to what it was prior to the holiday.Anti-Japan sentiment across China escalated last month amid a row over a group of uninhabited islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China, whose nearby waters are thought to hold potentially rich natural gas reserves. They have been under Japan’s control since 1895.Demonstrators vandalised properties of Japanese companies, including a Toyota outlet in the eastern city of Qingdao that was torched, in the latest flare-up in tensions that have smouldered since the end of World War Two.The latest production adjustments come on top of general cutbacks the Japanese automakers had been making before the protests, as the Chinese economy grew at its slowest pace in more than three years in the second quarter.But the dramatic drop in demand for cars made by Japanese brands, which had a combined share of roughly a fifth of China’s passenger car market in August before the protests, has been an unexpected boon for foreign rivals.South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co’s China sales climbed 15 percent to 84,188 vehicles last month, while Volkswagen’s Audi boosted sales by 20 percent, BMW by 55 percent and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz by 10 percent.

TOYOTA, Japan, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Widely used to settle potential flashpoints in tennis and cricket among other sports, Hawk-Eye’s goal-line technology is set for its first runout at soccer’s Club World Cup.Being deployed at the FIFA tournament alongside competing company GoalRef - installed in Yokohama - the Hawk-Eye system gets its turn in Sunday’s quarter-finals in Toyota.FIFA, initially reluctant, finally gave the go-ahead for technology to be used after Frank Lampard’s infamous disallowed goal for England against Germany at the 2010 World Cup.Hawk-Eye’s managing director said on Saturday that he was hoping for a controversial goal-line incident for Hawk-Eye to be able to demonstrate its accuracy.“We’re definitely hoping for a Luis Garcia moment,�� Steve Carter told Reuters, referring to the “ghost goal�� which knocked Chelsea out of the 2004-05 Champions League in the semi-finals.“Hopefully we can have a phantom goal to prove to the world it works.“Hawk-Eye doesn’t interfere with the ball, goals or posts. We think it is important for technology in sport to be as non-invasive as possible.”The technology was demonstrated at Toyota Stadium on Saturday, with “perfect�� results, Carter added.Hawk-Eye relies on seven high-speed cameras set up at different angles covering each goal to calculate decisions in a split second to the referee through a vibrating wrist-watch.GoalRef uses a microchip coil inside the ball and low magnetic waves around the goal.Hawk-Eye deploys 10 cameras in tennis and six in cricket, where it was first used as a broadcast tool for the leg before wicket decision, tracking the trajectory of the ball.Its use in tennis has largely eliminated the John McEnroe-type tantrums of bygone years with its system of instant replays after disputed points.“We have 12 years of experience delivering technology in sport,�� said Carter. “We cover more than 70 tennis tournaments globally, we also cover the majority of international cricket.“Hawk-Eye has more to lose than anyone. If there was a problem with our football system there would be significant repercussions with our businesses in tennis and cricket.”GoalRef was used for the Club World Cup curtain raiser between Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Auckland City on Thursday but was not needed in a 1-0 for the Japanese champions.Hiroshima face Egypt’s Al-Ahly and South Koreans Ulsan Hyundai meet Mexico’s Monterrey in Sunday’s quarter-finals in Toyota.Dethroned European champions Chelsea and South American Libertadores Cup holders Corinthians join the competition at the semi-final stage next week.	9.322625698
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co plans to launch its next-generation fuel-cell electric vehicle in early 2018, Vice Chairman Yang Woong-chul said on Wednesday, to better compete with Japanese rivals and meet tougher emissions rules.Hyundai launched the world’s first mass-produced fuel cell vehicle in 2013, dubbed the Tucson Fuel Cell, but sales have trailed expectations due in part to a lack of refueling stations and a high price tag.For its new fuel cell vehicle, the automaker is set to double the driving range to about 800 kilometers (497 miles), the Electronic Times reported in January.The new model will be a sport utility vehicle (SUV), in contrast to the fuel cell sedans of Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, the South Korean newspaper reported citing a high-ranking Hyundai official.The automaker declined to comment on details of the new fuel cell vehicle when contacted by Reuters. Vice Chairman Yang was speaking on Wednesday during a ministerial tour of a Hyundai research and development center.Hyundai, which has long trumpeted fuel-cell vehicles - those powered by electricity generated using hydrogen and oxygen - also plans to launch its first battery-powered car later this year.	6.214235519

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T posted a quarterly loss on Friday, hit by massive recall costs for Takata air bags but forecast a rebound this year as it took dramatic steps to put the debacle behind it.Japan's third-largest automaker by sales said it would recall 21 million more vehicles, on top of the 30 million already recalled, to replace potentially deadly air-bag inflators made by Takata Corp 7312.T.“Honda accounted for the worst of the Takata-related issue in the last financial year,�� said a brokerage analyst who asked not be named because he covers Honda as part of a team. “The worst could be over and that’s positive.”With the new recall, Honda, Takata’s biggest customer, will have replaced all the ammonium nitrate-based inflators that do not use a chemical drying agent, Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told an earnings briefing.These are thought to be responsible globally for at least 11 deaths - all but one in Honda vehicles - and more than 100 injuries since 2008.When exposed to moisture, ammonium nitrate, used to explosively inflate the air bag, can cause the inflator to rupture with deadly force, spraying shrapnel into vehicle occupants.For the three months ended March 31, Honda posted a net loss of 93.4 billion yen ($860 million), dashing expectations of a 115.35 billion yen profit, as forecast in a survey of nine analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“Recall-related costs nullified profit growth that was driven by increased auto sales, cost cuts and lower materials costs in the last financial year,�� said Senior Managing Officer Kohei Takeuchi.Honda said its full-year results absorbed the impact of roughly 267 billion yen more in quality-related costs than its original estimate after the U.S. Transportation Department ordered an expansion of Takata recalls.The company said it had set aside a total 436 billion yen for air bag-related costs in the last business year, nearly quadruple the 120 billion yen in the previous year.Honda has been phasing out the use of Takata’s replacement kits and said recently they were no longer used.Iwamura said that Honda models are all compliant with regulations, when asked about Mitsubishi Motors' 7211.T fuel-economy cheating scandal. Japan has ordered domestic automakers to submit fuel-economy test data by May 18.Nissan Motor 7201.T is set to take de facto control of Mitsubishi with a $2.2 billion investment. Honda forecast a 13.2 percent rise in net profit to 390 billion yen for this business year on smaller recall costs. It assumes the dollar will average 105 yen this year, compared with last year’s average of 120 yen and a current rate around 108 yen.Its profit growth forecast for this year came after Toyota 7203.T predicted a drop in net profit and Nissan saw flat growth, largely due to the stronger yen, which makes exports less profitable. “Compared to Toyota and other automakers, Honda looks very good,�� the analyst said. “But compared to Honda’s fiscal 2014 results, its outlook is not that great because of a negative impact of a stronger yen.��	0.862924023
* Nikkei gains 0.5 pct by break after previous day’s 5 pct drop* Benchmark index helped by short covering* Toyota, Sony, Keyence rise; Fast Retailing, SoftBank fallTOKYO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei rebounded slightly on Wednesday, helped by short-covering, but struggled to stay afloat after plummeting into bear market territory the previous day.The Nikkei share average rose 0.45 percent to finish the morning session at 19,241.87, barely shaking off the 5.01 plunge of the previous session - the steepest single-day decline in over two years.The searing sell-off has left the benchmark down about 21 percent from a 27-year peak scaled in early October, meaning it’s still in bear market territory entered during the previous session.The broader Topix was 0.88 percent higher at 1,427.94, but down 25.5 percent from a high of 1,911.31 hit in late January.The stock market woes weren’t confined to Japan. Wall Street had a torrid day on Christmas eve, leaving global equity markets heading into the year-end under a heavy cloud as concerns over world growth and U.S. political uncertainty jangled investor nerves.A U.S. federal government shutdown and President Donald Trump’s increasingly hostile stance towards the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, kept investors well clear of riskier assets.“For short-term sentiment to improve, it’s necessary for Democrats and Republicans to agree on the budget so that the government shutdown will be lifted,�� said Yutaka Miura, chief technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.“I think there is a possibility selling (in Japanese stocks) will resume after rebounding once because the uncertainty hasn’t been resolved completely yet.”The Nikkei was helped by short covering, Miura said.Shares of some index heavyweights rebounded on Wednesday, with Toyota Motor Co rising 0.4 percent, Sony Corp and Nintendo both adding 1.5 percent, and factory automation maker Keyence up 1.8 percent.Other index heavyweights fell, however, with Fast Retailing down 0.8 percent and SoftBank Group giving up 1.4 percent.Exporters got a small boost as the yen moved somewhat off a four-month high against the dollar reached overnight after Japan’s top currency official said Tokyo stands ready to take necessary steps if the market becomes too erratic.Electronics manufacturer Panasonic gained 1.7 percent while construction machinery maker Komatsu advanced 0.8 percent and factory robot maker Fanuc Ltd tacked on 1.1 percent.All but four of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s 33 subsectors were in positive territory, led by precision machinery and air transport.	8.793527963
BEIJING, Sept 26 (Reuters) - China’s auto market has rebounded smartly from the COVID-19 crash in recent months, especially for high-end cars, but questions about the durability of that recovery will hang over the Beijing autoshow, starting on Saturday.A rare industry event being held in person during the pandemic, the show marks a triumph for the world’s biggest car market, pummelled from late last year as lockdowns froze activity in the world’s second-biggest economy, where the disease erupted.This show will be a far cry from the usual ebullience as fewer attend, new models are scant and prospects remain uncertain.Among the bright spots: the Chinese market’s sharp bounce since April, strong demand for midsize to large luxury vehicles and a flood of interest - and investment - in electric vehicles.China’s auto sales rose 11.6% in August from a year earlier, the fifth straight rise after plunging on coronavirus lockdowns. When almost all residents were told to stay home in February, sales collapsed a record 79% to their lowest since 2005.The “Golden September, Silver October�� period is off to a good start, according to preliminary data, with passenger car sales up 12% in the first 20 days of September.The rebound means this year’s sales will fall less than 10%, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers estimates, better than its May forecast of a 15% to 25% decline.Much of the upturn is driven by sales of larger passenger cars by such makers as Daimler and BMW, boosted by new models, automakers�� discounts and a broader economic recovery.Premium vehicles accounted for a record 15% of the Chinese market in August, up from around 10% for all of last year, said the China Passenger Car Association.Electric vehicles are also providing buzz to the Beijing show, as a boom in Tesla shares has propelled interest in China, where EV startups like Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto and WM Motor have together raised more than $8 billion this year.But the recent improvement reflects Chinese carmakers making earlier model launches as they could not wait for the usual hype from the delayed autoshow before going to market. That suggests a more limited upside to the current sales rise.“This year’s auto sales are very different from previous years,�� said senior LMC Automotive analyst Alan Kang. “Many cars were sold during summer because customers delayed purchases after the lockdown.”Sales of larger sedans and sport-utility vehicles have returned to last year’s levels, but competition among mass-market brands is intensifying, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.That’s a key battle ground for international and domestic brands including Volkswagen, Toyota, and Geely. Still, he said, “Sales performance in these two months will give us clue of what will happen next.��	-2.323358577
(Rewrites throughout with final industry figures)TORONTO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The top auto companies sold more vehicles in Canada last month than a year ago, according to industry data released on Tuesday, with Chrysler Canada leading the pack as the top-selling carmaker for January.Sales were up 3.4 percent, with 99,051 cars and trucks sold in Canada, industry data showed.“Overall, the market exhibited some surprising resilience,�� DesRosiers Automotive Consultants wrote in a note to clients, but cautioned about putting too much weight on January sales figures.“We continue to believe that the market has room to grow in Canada, although we are most definitely in a period of high uncertainty.”Chrysler Canada, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , said it sold 18,054 cars and trucks last month, 2 percent higher than a year ago, when it sold 17,698 vehicles.Chrysler, which set January sales records for its Ram and Jeep brands, said truck sales rose 8.5 percent, while car sales fell 34.7 percent.Ford Motor Co of Canada reported a modest 0.4 percent rise in overall sales, having delivered 14,591 cars and trucks.Like Chrysler, Ford car sales were down sharply, off 28.5 percent, while truck sales rose 7.2 percent.GM Canada had the biggest sales gain for January among the Detroit automakers, with 11,577 cars and trucks sold in the first month of the year, a 5.3 percent increase from the 10,991 vehicles it sold in January 2014.Car sales climbed 4.3 percent, while truck sales rose 5.7 percent, the company said.Toyota Canada set a January sales record, selling 11,522 vehicles and beating last year’s sales by 8.1 percent. Truck sales were up 11 percent.Luxury brands such as Lexus, Audi and Porsche saw double digit growth in January. Lexus, a unit of Toyota, saw sales surge 39.3 percent, while Audi and Porsche both reported sales growth of more than 20 percent.

TOKYO/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s Volvo AB will sell its Japan-based UD Trucks business to Isuzu Motors in a deal worth around $2.3 billion, exiting a low-margin business and boosting its cash pile as competition for high-tech trucking heats up.The deal, announced by the companies on Wednesday, is part of a broader alliance that will see them share advanced technology for electric and self-driving trucks and use their combined heft to cut development costs.Volvo shares rose 5% in morning trading. Isuzu shares had gained 3% during Tokyo trading hours.The partnership is the latest in a growing trend among vehicle makers joining forces to better compete in an industry upended by the rise of electric vehicles, self-driving cars and other new technologies.Volvo said the transaction will add to its operating income by about SEK 2 billion ($208 million) and increase its net cash by SEK 22 billion.The Japanese trucking market is very competitive and not very profitable, analysts said, so the UD Trucks sale will free up cash for Volvo, as it competes with Germany’s Daimler, India’s Tata Motors and China’s Dongfeng Motor.Volvo is among the world’s biggest makers of heavy duty trucks and owns brands including Volvo Trucks, France’s Renault Trucks and U.S.-based Mack Trucks.“This is a way to focus the business to where they are strong and making good money, and at the same time exit with a small gain,�� Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau told Reuters.Isuzu specializes in light- to medium-sized trucks, while UD Trucks are strong in heavy as well as to a certain extent in mid-duty.The deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and will consolidate a stagnant truck industry in Japan dominated by Toyota-owned Hino Motors.For Isuzu, a specialist in diesel engine technology, the partnership will give access to Volvo’s electric truck technology, which has already been deployed in distribution and waste disposal trucks.“We will lean on each other’s strengths, pool from each other when it comes to technology, and leverage our larger volumes,�� Volvo Group President and CEO Martin Lundstedt told reporters in Tokyo.Norway’s DNB Markets said the cash generated from the transaction will be distributed to Volvo shareholders either through an additional dividend or through share buybacks.	-1.650396798
BANGKOK, July 29 (Reuters) - Sales in Thailand’s automotive industry are expected to fall 31 percent to 920,000 million vehicles in 2014 after months of political unrest earlier in the year, Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Tuesday.In January, it projected a 13.6 percent drop in annual automotive sales across the industry to 1.15 million.However, the political situation and the economy are likely to improve in the second half of this year and that should help boost consumption, Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Thai unit, told a news conference.

Harvick wins for first time this season at SonomaSONOMA, Calif. -- California driver Kevin Harvick claimed his first win of the 2017 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season in his home state Sunday by winning the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway.“I am so excited,�� Harvick said. “I think as you look at it, getting our first win with Ford, this has been a great journey for us as an organization and team. Kurt (Busch) winning the Daytona 500 and we have run well. Everybody from Bush, Jimmy John’s and Mobil 1, Outback, Hunt Brothers and everybody. It is a great day. It finally all came together and we were able to not have any cautions there at the end.“Rodney had great strategy and I was able to take care of the car and get out front. I felt like the 78 (Martin Truex Jr.) was the car we had to race, and then, he had problems and from there, we were in control.”The win also was his first win on the road course.The race ended under the checkered and yellow flags after Kasey Kahne crashed on the final lap.Harvick took the race lead from Kyle Busch with just under 45 laps remaining and then losing it to Truex a lap later. But when the field began cycling through green-flag pit stops in the last 40 laps, Harvick cycled ahead of Truex.Truex lost a cylinder and retired from the race with engine problems inside the final 25 laps.“It’s very disappointing,�� Truex said. “I mean, sitting there running second on seven cylinders and stayed right with the leader. I mean, this Toyota was so good today. Everyone at Furniture Row (Racing) did an awesome job with it. Everybody back in Denver, thank you for guys for just crazy fast cars. TRD (Toyota Racing Development) stuff has been really good for the past year and a half. You know sometimes these things happen, so appreciate all their effort out there at TRD. Make good power, it’s just this one wasn’t ready to go the whole distance today.”Brad Keselowski stayed out longer and still needed to make one final pit stop when he lost the lead to Harvick with 22 laps remaining. Keselowski finally pitted inside the final 20 laps. By that time, Denny Hamlin was a distant second to Harvick and Clint Bowyer third.Bowyer got by Hamlin to take second inside the final five laps and give Stewart-Haas Racing a one-two finish, with Harvick still holding a sizable lead.“We were fast all weekend,�� Bowyer said. “With clean air and a long run, that’s always my strong suit. We got the long run, we just hard to start dead last to get it.”Keselowski got by Hamlin on the final lap to finish third for his first career top-five Sonoma finish. Hamlin and Kyle Busch rounded out the top five.“The Freightliner Ford was really good today,�� Keselowski said. “We didn’t have the qualifying fun we wanted. We had amazing race pace. That’s a credit to everyone at Team Penske. It felt really good. I just wish I could run this race again I think I might have had better car than driver today and I learned a lot. Just an amazing fun day.”Hamlin led early in the final third stage of the race that made up the last 60 laps of the 110-lap race when he stayed out after Jimmy Johnson gave up the lead to pit between the second and third stages.“It was good, definitely had a great car,�� Hamlin said. “We didn’t have quite enough at the end. We did have real short run speed. We didn’t�� really have great long run speed. We had just had good middle speed and that worked out for us. We had good pit strategy and really passed a lot of cars today and that’s about what we had.”Johnson claimed his first stage win of the season by running up front at lap 50, the end of the second 25-lap stage. Keselowski and Matt Kenseth were second and third at the end of the stage.Truex led the way early in the second stage but gave up the lead to pit during a debris caution on lap 39. When Truex hit pit road, Johnson inherited the lead. Truex lost several more positions with a slow stop, in addition to the varying pit strategies.Several drivers pitted before pit road closed in the final laps of the second stage. The move didn’t pay off for Bowyer, though, as he was nabbed for speeding on pit road.Truex won the opening 25-lap stage, followed by A.J. Allmendinger and Kyle Larson in second and third. It was Truex’s 11th stage win of the 2017 season so far.Truex passed pole-sitter Larson for the lead on lap 10. After losing the lead, Larson ran off track, giving up second to Allmendinger.The top three were shuffled outside the top 10, though, when the yellow flag waved for the first time on lap 15 for an incident involving Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Danica Patrick that resulted in slight damage to Larson’s car.Larson, Earnhardt and Patrick also were players in a second incident that brought out the third caution on lap 31 and ended the race for Ricky Stenhouse Jr., the other driver involved.“They were three-wide in front of us trying to go through turn four, which never works,�� Stenhouse said. “They were all dive-bombing each other and then the 10 (Patrick) got spinning and I tried to go low and she just kept coming down the track. We just clipped it a little bit and tore the left front up too bad to continue. It is a bummer for our day. We felt like we had probably a decent Sonoma car for us. Really just wanted to get out there and make laps. I thought we were decent on the long run, just trying to get there.”NOTES: The race was the first in stages for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series on a road course. ... Matt Kenneth had to start in the back because of an engine change. Alon Day also started in the back after missing driver introductions. ... Erik Jones and Chase Elliott started the race in backup cars because of wrecks in practice. They started where they qualified, because they had already gone to backups by qualifying. ... Kevin Harvick won the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West race at Sonoma on Saturday. ... Kyle Larson’s pole at Sonoma was his third pole of the season but marked the fifth time this year he started first. He started first in two other races by virtue of being the points leader when rain forced cancellations of qualifying. ... Tony Stewart won the 2016 Toyota/Save Mart 350 and Denny Hamlin finished second. ... Hamlin won the most recent Cup Series road-course race, the 2016 race at Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International. ... Kyle Busch is the only Sonoma multi-race winner among active drivers with two wins at the track, most recently in 2015. ... With several teams going calling on road-course specialists for the Toyota/Save Mart 350, the race field included drivers making their Cup Series debut, including Day, Billy Johnson, Kevin O’Connell and Tommy Regan. When Day took the green flag, he became the first Israeli driver to start a NASCAR premier series race. ... Ten of the 38 drivers in the race hail from California.	5.515336255
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T has named the head of its Americas operations as its next president and CEO after its current chief steps down in June, as Japan's fifth-largest automaker seeks to boost profitability in North America, its biggest market.The company said on Friday that Masamichi Kogai will step down and be replaced by current vice president Akira Marumoto who now oversees operations in the Americas. The changes are effective June 26 after Mazda’s annual shareholders�� meeting.Mazda, which has global annual sales of around 1.6 million vehicles, has enjoyed a run of rising vehicle sales, expanding in markets particularly in North America, its biggest market which accounts for nearly 30 percent of total sales.But as one of Japan’s smaller automakers and a tiny player globally, it faces growing competition in the United States, where market growth has slowed, and where the company’s profitability has sagged due to higher discounting and slowing demand for sedans.The maker of the MX-5 Miata roadster and the reputed Skyactiv gasoline engines also faces higher costs to stay competitive in an industry which is being disrupted by new technologies, including self-driving cars and electric vehicles.Marumoto, a 38-year company veteran with a background in engineering who described himself as having a “strict�� work ethic and admitted to being “short-tempered�� at times, previously led Mazda’s corporate planning and product strategy divisions before heading its Americas operations.He said that growing sales and improving profitability in the North American market would be his biggest priority, along with expanding the company’s brand image as an innovative car maker.“Given the rapid changes occurring in the auto industry at the moment it’s often asked whether a small company like us will be OK,�� Marumoto, 60, told reporters at a briefing in Tokyo.“But before we even consider this we need to show our strengths, and what makes us different if we want to grow our brand.”Kogai, who became Mazda’s president and CEO in 2013, will be following the footsteps of his two immediate predecessors who also held the top job for five years each. He will still be with the automaker and become its chairman, the company said.Earlier this year, Mazda announced that it would invest in a new, $1.6 billion plant in the U.S. state of Alabama as a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. Mazda and Toyota are jointly developing affordable electric vehicles, pooling resources to better compete in the race for new car technologies. As part of this partnership announced last year, Toyota has taken a 5 percent stake in its smaller rival.Last month, Mazda forecast a 28 percent drop in full-year operating profit, hurt by a stronger yen as well as higher spending.	-0.6663286739
DETROIT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it will recall about 20,000 vehicles worldwide for possible fuel leaks.Most of the affected vehicles are in the United States but were also shipped to other countries, Toyota said.Toyota Motor Sales USA said the recall involves vehicles with its 2GR-FE engine.The recall includes the 2015 model year Lexus RX, and four 2014 model year Toyota vehicles: Avalon, Camry, Highlander and Sienna. Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand.A fuel delivery pipe in the engine may leak because it was not correctly welded by a Toyota supplier company, the automaker said. This could lead to a leak, which could increase the risk of fire.Toyota said it was not aware of any fires, crashes, injuries or fatalities caused by the problem.All of the affected Toyota models were produced in the United States, with the Lexus model made in Canada. They were shipped around the world, including to South Korea, Russia, Australia, other parts of Asia and the Middle East, a Toyota spokesman said.Technicians at Toyota and Lexus dealers will inspect the fuel delivery pipe and if it was produced at that particular supplier, they will replace it with a new one, Toyota said.

TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co is making its remodelled Fit subcompact the pillar of an ambitious global expansion, elevating it to a status now enjoyed by its flagship Civic as it shifts focus to emerging markets and deploys a low-cost parts sourcing scheme.Chief Executive Takanobu Ito has set an aggressive target to boost the No.3 Japanese automaker’s global car sales to 6 million vehicles or more annually by the year to March 2017 from 4 million last year. Half those sales will be in emerging markets.The redesigned Fit series, popular in Japan and in emerging Asian markets where it is sold as the Jazz, will account for one-quarter of the 6 million target - about the same ratio that the Civic holds now.Honda aims to double sales of Fit series vehicles to 1.5 million in the year ending March 2017 from 760,000 in calendar year 2012, Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura has said.The 12-year-old Fit series includes hatchback and sedan models, with an SUV to be added in the latest makeover. The first model in the redesigned series, a hatchback, will go on sale in Japan in September.While Honda is also mulling developing cars based on its Japan-only “kei�� microcars for emerging markets, Ito has singled out the Fit, with its track record of strong sales in Asia, as crucial to achieving the expansion target.But for his strategy to succeed, Honda needed to boost the Fit’s profitability given that small cars tend to bring in less money than bigger models.“That’s a big problem for Honda because we are increasingly reliant on small cars, but we were able to improve profitability for the Fit series,�� Hiroshi Takemura, who oversees Honda’s small car operations, told Reuters in an interview last month.For the redesigned Fit, Honda revamped its parts sourcing and vehicle development, allowing it to buy the cheapest parts from around the world in large volume and cut parts procurement costs by 20 percent, he said.It involved engineers from around the world in the early stages of product development to reflect different regional requirements, such as with air conditioning systems, and to make it possible to source cheaper, locally produced parts, he said.Honda also cut gaps in launch times for the Fit across regions and across vehicle types such as hatchbacks and sedans, boosting production volumes and allowing assembly plants to buy parts in larger lots for less cost.The redesigned Fit hatchback, which competes with Volkswagen AG’s Golf and Toyota Motor Corp’s Yaris, will go on sale in North America and Asia only a few months after the September debut in Japan. That is much less than the year or more lag for past Fit models.The Fit SUV will follow the hatchback in Japan late this year, with the Fit sedan, sold mainly in emerging markets as the City, hitting showrooms last.Honda is also revamping its one-motor gas-electric hybrid version of the Fit hatchback, boosting fuel efficiency to surpass that of Toyota’s Prius C, Honda spokesman Tsuyoshi Hojo said.Honda will offer the new hybrid in Japan but has yet to disclose where else it may be sold. The existing model is sold in Europe, Thailand, Malaysia and China as well as Japan. (Editing by Ed Klamann and Chris Gallagher)	-1.611665388
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Japan's biggest automaker by volume, has fallen to the No. 3 spot among Japanese automakers in China, due to lack of presence in a key segment �� a situation experts say will likely prevail well past the middle of 2018.Through October, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T both outsold Toyota in China, the world's biggest car market.Toyota’s sales in the first 10 months of this year totaled 1.07 million vehicles, compared with 1.16 million vehicles Honda sold during the same period. Nissan’s volume through October amounted to 1.17 million vehicles.China-market experts believe the main cause for Toyota’s relative weakness lies in the lack of smallish crossover sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) that others, most notably Honda in recent months, have leveraged to accelerate growth.Honda’s sales have started to grow relatively rapidly and more consistently since 2015, after two key subcompact crossover SUVs hit the market in late 2014.Though volume growth from these two models �� the XR-V and the Vezel �� have decelerated more recently, the gap was filled by the redesigned Civic car, among other models. The Civic hit the Chinese market in April last year.However, Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, isn’t all that pessimistic about Toyota’s sales outlook.“Toyota’s compact sedans, especially (gasoline-electric) hybrid versions of the Corolla and the Levin, are doing well,�� Zhang said. “That would give Toyota moderate growth in 2017 and next year, but the issue is the lack of presence�� in one of the hottest segment in the Chinese auto market, he said.If Toyota had subcompact crossover SUVs like Honda’s Vezel and XR-V, “the company can generate an extra volume of 150,000 units a year at the least, which would be a pure incremental volume for Toyota since they don’t offer any product in this segment today,�� Zhang said.Toyota marketing and advertising officials said that gap in the company’s product offerings will not be addressed by the middle of 2018.China-market versions of the subcompact Toyota CH-R crossover SUV will likely hit showrooms in China in a June-July time frame, they said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with reporters. The CH-R hit showrooms in the United States in April this year.Toyota had no immediate and particular response to who is up and who is down in sales rankings within China. “We would like to continue to grow steadily in the Chinese market,�� a Beijing-based spokesman said.	-1.353287693
(Refiles to remove extraneous word from headline)TOKYO/BEIJING, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Several Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor Corp reported damage to cars and facilities after two huge explosions at the Chinese port of Tianjin tore through an industrial area where toxic chemicals and gas were stored.The blasts in the city of Tianjin on Wednesday night killed at least 50 people, including a dozen fire fighters, state media said. About 700 people were injured.Toyota said on Friday that the blasts broke windows at its car assembly, logistics, and research and development facilities. Operations had been closed for a week-long summer holiday and no one was injured, it said.But two workers at a dealership were hurt by broken glass, and there had been reports of several injuries to employees living in the surrounding area, including at a company dormitory, Toyota said.Some vehicles were “affected�� by the explosion but Toyota was still trying to find out the extent of the damage and the number of vehicles involved, the company said.“In our current view, the damage isn’t that severe,�� a Beijing-based Toyota spokesman said.Toyota’s factory, logistics and R&amp;D facilities are jointly run with China FAW Group Corporation. Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd has a stake in the logistics centre.Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, meanwhile, said more than 100 cars exported from Japan and awaiting customs clearance in a warehouse were damaged by broken windows. The warehouse, which does not belong to Fuji Heavy, is located about 2 km (1.2 miles) from the blast site, it said.Mazda Motor Corp said an unknown number of its cars imported from Japan were also damaged, with peeling paint and scratches. One nearby showroom closed its doors on Thursday after its windows shattered, a spokesman said.Among others, Honda Motor Co said it had seen no impact on its motorcycle factory, owned jointly with Sundiro Holding Co Ltd, and all dealerships in the area were operating normally. Some showrooms were slightly affected but the extent of damage was unknown, a local spokesman said.Among Japanese retailers, Aeon Co said a mall about 2 km away with broken windows was closed on Friday.“We want to reopen as soon as possible but we don’t know when that would be,�� a spokesman said. The company is assessing the damage inside the building, he added.Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd had ceiling damage near the entrance of a department store about 4 km away, it said. It was operating normally on Friday, a spokesman said.Otsuka Holdings Co said a factory that makes the Pocari Sweat sports drink 4 km away would be closed on Friday and Saturday to confirm the site’s safety.

MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI and Peugeot owner PSA PEUP.PA plan to join forces in a 50-50 share merger to create the world's fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand.The companies said on Thursday they aimed to reach a binding deal in the coming weeks to create a $50 billion group with listings in Paris, Milan and New York. PSA’s Carlos Tavares would be CEO and Fiat Chrysler’s (FCA) John Elkann chairman.It was less than five months ago that FCA abandoned merger talks with PSA's French rival Renault RENA.PA, and the move comes as carmakers grapple with a downturn in their markets as well as hefty investments in electric and self-driving vehicles.FCA would get access to PSA’s more modern vehicle platforms, helping it to meet tough new emissions rules, while Europe-focused PSA would benefit from FCA’s profitable U.S. business featuring brands such as Ram and Jeep.However, the deal could still face close regulatory scrutiny, while governments in Rome, Paris and unions are all likely to be wary about potential job losses from a combined workforce of around 400,000.Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said that, adjusting for the differences in market value and planned dividend payments, achieving the 50-50 split would effectively see PSA paying a 32% premium to take control of FCA.FCA shares jumped as much as 11% to a one-year high of 14.248 euros. PSA shares fell as much as 14% to a two-week low of 22.33 euros.“PSA shareholders are assuming more market risk than FCA’s,�� Houchois said, adding a PSA-FCA deal was still the most logical and attractive combination in the industry.The tie-up would create a group with 8.7 million in annual vehicle sales, putting it fourth globally behind Volkswagen, Toyota and the Renault-Nissan alliance.The companies aim to make 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of savings without plant closures, and achieve around 80% within four years, at a one-off cost of 2.8 billion euros.The combined group would include the Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Peugeot, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands, serving mass and premium passenger car markets as well as trucks and light commercial vehicles markets.“There is still plenty of work to do before we reach a formal agreement, but what’s clear is that the opportunity that represents for both companies is very compelling,�� said FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley.The plan comes at a difficult time for the auto industry. Manufacturers Ford, Daimler and Volkswagen and supplier Continental have in the past months lowered their forecasts citing a steeper-than-expected drop in demand.However, FCA bucked the trend on Thursday, beating third-quarter earnings forecasts thanks to record profitability in its North American business.Graphic: Fiat Chrysler vs Peugeot in a snapshot,French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed tie-up plan, which would give Paris a say in two of the world’s top four carmakers. That contrasts with a FCA-Renault merger, which risked leaving PSA behind.“It gives us critical size to face the dual challenges of autonomous vehicles and electric cars,�� Le Maire told reporters.Paris, which has a 12% stake in PSA, was blamed for the collapse of the FCA-Renault talks by urging Renault to focus on its existing alliance with Japan’s Nissan. The French government also owns 15% of Renault.Italian industry minister Stefano Patuanelli said the deal was good news provided it didn’t affect jobs in Italy.The merged group would be domiciled in the Netherlands, but have operating centres in France, Italy and the United States, and would have an 11-person board, with six members coming from PSA including Tavares, and five from FCA including Elkann.Analysts, who questioned whether FCA and Renault had the management expertise to deliver a mega-merger, said Tavares was the right man for the job, having returned Opel to profit after buying it from General Motors (GM) in 2017.The former Renault executive has emerged as one of the leading figures in the auto industry following the death last year of FCA’s former CEO Sergio Marchionne and the arrest of former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn.Marchionne long championed a merger for FCA, a cause that has been taken up by Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family that owns a 29.2% stake in FCA and will be the largest shareholder in a combined PSA-FCA, with a 14.5% stake.One industry source said Tavares had made savings at Opel by cutting engineering centres in Germany and consolidating activity in France. A similar move with FCA could fuel opposition in Italy.As part of the deal, FCA would pay its shareholders a 5.5 billion euro special dividend and hand them shares in its robot-making unit Comau. PSA, meanwhile, would distribute to its investors its 46% stake in supplier Faurecia.Citi analysts said the cash payout for FCA shareholders contrasted with the Faurecia shares, worth about 2.7 billion euros at Wednesday’s close, being offered to PSA shareholders, saying the latter were “being asked to remain patient.”China’s Dongfeng Motor has a 12.2% equity stake and 19.5% voting stake in PSA, and there has been speculation it might use the tie-up to sell its holdings.One banking source told Reuters Dongfeng would be able to sell its stakes, which could help ease the deal’s passage through U.S. regulators, given U.S.-Chinese trade tensions.Stricter anti-pollution rules from 2021 have triggered heavy investments into electric and hybrid vehicles as European lawmakers force a further reduction in vehicle C02 emissions.A combination with PSA would give FCA access to the French group’s CMP modular platform, which was launched in 2019 for Peugeot’s e-208 compact city car, and donated for Opel to build the Corsa-e mini.The CMP platform was jointly developed by Dongfeng and PSA.Strategy firm PA Consulting has forecast FCA faces 700 million euros in emissions fines unless it radically shifts to selling more electric and hybrid cars.PSA has moved Opel and Vauxhall from nine GM platforms to just two, helping Opel to return to profit after more than a decade of losses.FCA is being advised by Goldman Sachs and D’Angelin; PSA is working with Morgan Stanley, Mediobanca’s Messier Maris &amp; Associes unit and Perella; and Lazard is advising Exor, the Agnelli’s holding company, sources close to the deal said.	0.3146678109
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will push back the start of operations at its scheduled new plant in Mexico, to the first half of 2020 from the initial plan of 2019, the company said on Thursday.Japan’s top automaker had initially planned to start building the Corolla sedan at the $1 billion Guanajuato plant but said last week it would switch production to a new U.S. factory to be built with Mazda Motor Corp.Toyota said the delay was necessary to adjust its supply chain in Mexico to produce the truck-based Tacoma pickup model instead of the Corolla compact car. That factory could also build sport utility vehicles, a Toyota spokesman in Mexico said last week.“With the production model change to the Tacoma pickup, the start of production will consequently be in the first half of 2020,�� a Toyota spokeswoman said.“However, we will make our utmost effort to advance the timing in order to minimize the impact to suppliers and the local community.”Until the scheduled start of the joint venture plant with Mazda in 2021, Toyota will supply the Corollas that were initially slated to be built in Mexico from its factories in Mississippi and Japan, the company said.	3.42587649

TOKYO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A rescue of Renesas Electronics is being organised by a consortium of local companies led by Toyota Motor Corp, with the backing of a state-run fund, to counter a bid for the Japanese chipmaker by private equity firm KKR, the Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday.The group wants to invest 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in Renesas to acquire a majority stake in the company before the end of the year, the Nikkei said, without providing further details on how it obtained the information.The group, it said, included the government’s Innovation Network Corp, Panasonic Corp, Nissan Motor Co Honda Motor Co, Canon Inc, Fanuc Corp and auto parts makers Denso Corp and Keihin Corp .KKR is also in talks to invest around 100 billion yen in Renesas, which would be its largest investment in Japan, sources last month told Reuters. That deal would give KKR more than 50 percent of cash-strapped Renesas, and could speed the pace of its restructuring in the face of sinking prices and aggressive overseas rivals.It would be among the top 10 biggest private equity investments into the world’s third largest economyThe competing deal from the Japanese group, which may invite German industrial group Bosch GmbH to join it, would be presented to Renesas shareholders, NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric Corp next month, the Nikkei said.Renesas, the world’s leading manufacturer of microcontroller chips used in cars, is laying off 12 percent of its workforce and plans to sell or consolidate half of its domestic plants.

LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - Carmaker Toyota said it could make a legal complaint against the official Brexit campaign for using its logo in leaflets, which the Japanese firm said might give the impression it backed Britain leaving the EU.On one “Vote Leave�� flyer, Toyota’s logo appeared next to those of five other major companies including fellow automakers Nissan and Vauxhall with the message: “Major employers ... have all said they’ll stay in the UK whatever the result of the referendum.”Toyota, which built more than one in 10 of Britain’s 1.6 million new cars last year, said in February it believed a vote on June 23 to stay in the bloc would be better for its operations and long-term competitiveness.The firm said on Thursday that use of the logo could “mislead the reader into thinking that Toyota endorses the Vote Leave campaign�� and that it could take action against “unauthorised use of our trademarks.”Vote Leave did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by Reuters.Britain’s overwhelmingly foreign-owned car industry has spoken out in favour of continued British membership of the EU, which allows it to benefit from tariff-free access to the single market and the free movement of people within the world’s biggest trading bloc.

PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday a Fiat Chrysler-Renault merger remained an “interesting opportunity�� but added he would tell the French carmaker’s chairman that strengthening the Renault-Nissan alliance was the priority.The French state is Renault’s biggest shareholder and sources have said chairman Jean-Dominique Senard is furious over the government’s interference at the carmaker after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) withdrew its offer for a 35 billion euro ($40 billion) merger with Renault.Le Maire said he would meet Senard later on Thursday, with the chairman’s position seen weakened by the deal’s collapse and the ensuing fallout with President Emmanuel Macron’s government.Le Maire told franceinfo radio he was not responsible for derailing the proposal that would have created the world’s third biggest carmaker behind Japan’s Toyota and Germany’s Volkswagen.“It remains in interesting opportunity. But I have always been very clear: that it should be in the context of a strategy to reinforce the (Renault-Nissan) alliance.”�As long as the French state is the main shareholder, its responsibility to the company, its employees, its factories and research centers is to fulfill its role with other shareholders in defining a strategy.”The deal collapsed after Nissan said it would abstain at a Renault board meeting to vote on the merger proposal, prompting Le Maire to request the Renault board to postpone the vote for five days.“We simply asked for five extra days. Five additional days seems entirely reasonable to me,�� Le Maire said. “Fiat withdrew its offer, as it was entitled to do. But believe me, the state will never react under pressure.��	2.60471099
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T may reconsider investing up to 20 billion baht ($609 million) in Thailand, and could even cut production, if political unrest drags on, the head of the Japanese automaker's local unit said on Monday.Toyota is the largest car manufacturer in Thailand, producing 800,000 vehicles a year. Plans to increase its annual capacity by 200,000 vehicles a year over the next three to four years are now uncertain, Kyoichi Tanada, president of Toyota’s Thai unit, told a news conference.“Our new investment in Thailand may not happen if the current political crisis goes on longer,�� Tanada said.“For new foreign investors, the political situation may force them to look for opportunity elsewhere. For those that have already invested, like Toyota, we will not go away. But whether we will invest (further) or not, we are unsure.”Thailand is the biggest auto market in Southeast Asia and a regional vehicle production and export base for the world's top car manufacturers like Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Ford Motor CoF.N.Protesters have been trying for more than two months to bring down Thailand’s government, forcing ministries to close and Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to shift her workplace as part of an attempted “shutdown�� of the capital.If the unrest affects economic growth, Toyota may cut its production in Thailand while it assesses the situation, Tanada said.“After the shutdown, we have fewer visitors going to our showrooms. We are ready to cut down our car output if we are affected by the political situation,�� he added.Toyota produced around 850,000 cars in Thailand in 2013, selling 445,000 domestically and exporting some 430,000 vehicles. This year, it aims to sell 400,000 cars domestically and export 445,000, Tanada said.Overall auto industry sales in Thailand are expected to fall 13.6 percent to 1.15 million vehicles in 2014, mainly due to weaker consumption and slow economic growth, data from Toyota’s Thai unit shows.This will be the second consecutive year of decline after an 80 percent surge in 2012 fuelled by government subsidies for first-time car buyers and pent-up demand after severe flooding in late 2011.Domestic auto sales fell 7.7 percent to 1.33 million vehicles in 2013, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).(Refiles to remove “and�� in reporter’s byline)	-4.258675079
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Thursday that it would cut prices of auto parts for its luxury Lexus models in China, following similar moves by its German rivals, in response to heightened regulatory scrutiny over anti-trust issues. Prices on about 15,000 parts will be reduced by an average 26 percent from next month, according to a statement posted on the Lexus website in China.“In response to the NDRC’s concerns over monopoly practices in the industry, Lexus China will cut prices of spare parts in China starting from Sept. 1,�� it said, referring to the National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s price regulator.“The company will ensure full compliance with the Chinese law, improve management behavior ... protect interests and rights of customers and contribute to the China auto industry,�� the statement added.BMW BMWG.DE, Volkswagen AG's Audi VOWG_p.DE and Mercedes-Benz have already announced price cuts on auto spare parts in China, in an effort to appease regulators which have accused some of them of anti-competitive behavior. An array of industries, from milk powder makers to electronics firms, has come under the Chinese regulatory spotlight in recent years as the government intensifies its efforts to make foreign companies comply with 2008 anti-monopoly legislation.Legal experts, however, point out that the authorities appear to have wielded the law against more foreign multinationals than local companies. Officials say the law is applied to both domestic and foreign firms, with the aim of protecting consumers.The official Xinhua news agency reported earlier this month that Mercedes-Benz has been found guilty of manipulating prices for after-sales services in China. The NDRC also said it would punish Audi and Fiat SpA's FIA.MI Chrysler for monopoly practices.Executives at Toyota told Reuters earlier in the month that the Chinese government is taking an “initial�� look into the auto parts policies of its Lexus brand.Toyota’s move comes a day after China fined 12 Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.2 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices.

TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp edged out Germany’s Volkswagen AG for the third straight month to be the world’s top-selling automaker so far this year, amid concerns that sales at the German company may suffer in the aftermath of a diesel emission scandal.Toyota on Monday said it sold 7.49 million cars worldwide in the year to September, more than Volkswagen’s 7.43 million during the same period. Toyota has been continuously out selling Volkswagen on a year-to-date basis since July.The German carmaker is battling its biggest business crisis in its 78-year history after admitting last month it installed software in diesel vehicles to deceive U.S. regulators about the true level of their toxic emissions.Total sales at Toyota and its subsidiaries Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co rose 13.6 percent from the first eight months of the year, although sales were 1.5 percent lower from the same period last year.

(Adds closing stock price)By Ben KlaymanNEW YORK, March 28 - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.TTM.N top North American executive voiced optimism on Thursday about the U.S. economy and said demand in the industry this year would be driven by the need for consumers to replace aging cars and trucks.Jim Lentz, newly appointed chief executive of North America, said the Japanese automaker sees U.S. industry new-car sales hitting 15.3 million this year, up from 14.5 million in 2012. Just six months ago, its 2013 forecast was for 14.7 million, but the company at the time believed talk of the fiscal cliff’s impact would dampen the economy.“We’re cautiously optimistic about a growing economy, but there’s still a lot of uncertainty that can derail the consumer’s attitude,�� Lentz said in an interview after the New York Auto Show.Offsetting his concerns were the improving mood of consumers, which is being reflected in a stronger housing market and rising stock market, and the need for people to replace cars and trucks, the average age of which has reached an all-time high in the United States of more than 11 years.“When people can look at their 401ks and see that not only have they not fallen, but they are now starting to gain ... that is a real positive to overall consumer confidence,�� Lentz said.Toyota should sell about 2.2 million cars and trucks under its three brands - Toyota, Lexus and Scion - this year, up from 2.08 million in 2012. The company is introducing nine new or updated vehicles this year.Automakers are scheduled to report March U.S. sales on Tuesday and Lentz said Toyota expects the industry’s annual sales rate to finish at about 15.4 million vehicles. That would mark the fifth straight month above the 15 million rate.However, Toyota has no plans to revisit its full-year estimate at this point as Lentz said the company is forecasting the sales rate to slow to a range of 15.1 million to 15.2 million in the second quarter.Lentz said a tightening of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve would have a minimal impact this year and in 2014 on consumers, many of whom have monthly car payments.“Whether you lease or whether you borrow money to buy a car, it’s still all about the monthly payment,�� he said. “Right now, if you look at car payments relative to income, cars have probably never been cheaper even though the price of cars continues to go up. That monthly payment is still very fixed.”However, Lentz agreed that the high residual values that automakers are setting on their leased vehicles is not sustainable. He said Toyota is already adjusting its residual values going forward.“In 2014-2015, this low, low lease party will come to an end,�� he said.Toyota shares closed down 46 cents at $102.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.	15.13534875

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s Peronist leader, Alberto Fernandez, was sworn in as president on Tuesday, marking a shift to the left for Latin America’s No. 3 economy as the country fights rampant inflation, credit default fears and rising poverty.The 60-year-old center-left politician took his presidential oath in front of cheering lawmakers in Congress along with political leaders from the region and representatives from major trade partners, including Brazil and the United States.In an hour-long speech he criticized rising rates of hunger and poverty and said the country needed to revive growth to escape from “virtual default�� after a period of painful austerity under outgoing conservative Mauricio Macri.“The economy and our social fabric today are in a state of extreme fragility,�� he said in the speech in Congress after he had symbolically taken the presidential baton and sash from Macri, whose tenure was hit by recession and debt crisis.“The government that has just finished its mandate has left the country in a situation of virtual default,�� Fernandez said.He pledged to bridge social divisions and to roll out a “massive�� credit system with low rates to bolster domestic demand, something he made a pillar of his campaign, and to boost spending to address hunger and poverty.The rise of Fernandez marks a return of Argentina’s powerful left-leaning Peronists, including Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a rock-star populist politician who clashed with investors and farmers during her twin terms between 2007-2015.In a move to underscore his man-of-the-people credentials, Fernandez had driven himself in his silver Toyota to Congress, waving to crowds lined along the roadside.Supporters gathered in the historic Plaza de Mayo square in the center of Buenos Aires opposite the pink-hued Casa Rosada palace waving banners and beating drums while food vendors grilled “choripan�� sausages in the summer heat.“Today there is going to be a party,�� said Rafael Mantero, 45, a food vendor from the city of Rosario, who said he voted for Fernandez because his own sales had fallen by around half in recent years under Macri. “These past four years were terrible for me economically,�� he said.The new administration is expected to usher in growth-focused policies after unpopular fiscal tightening, which critics warn could strain already depleted state coffers and potentially fan tensions with creditors.Colorful banners hung around the central city square, many from unions and grassroots organizations that helped drive the Peronists back to power. T-shirts with the face of Fernandez de Kirchner were captioned: “We’re back.”Supporters hope Fernandez can tackle annual inflation running above 50%, poverty approaching 40% amid recession, and tricky restructuring talks on around $100 billion in sovereign debt with lenders that include the International Monetary Fund.Fernandez said he would seek a “constructive and cooperative�� relationship with the IMF, which on Tuesday congratulated him and said it supported his policies to bolster growth.“There are no debt payments that can be sustained if the country does not grow,�� said Fernandez, adding that Argentina currently “had the will to pay, but not the capacity to do so.”In a reflection of political challenges ahead, Brazil’s right-wing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, who has clashed publicly with Fernandez, did not attend, the first time since 2002 a Brazilian president has not attended the inauguration in Buenos Aires.Fernandez also addressed the long-running dispute with Britain over the Falkland Islands, which Buenos Aires calls the Malvinas, saying he would “defend our sovereign rights�� over the islands, on which Argentina maintains its claim.Hard-hit Argentines, investors and markets are most closely watching Fernandez for his plans to right the economy. He picked Martín Guzmán, a young disciple of Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, to head the economy ministry.“Alberto needs to improve the economic and social situation,�� said Verónica Quintana, 34, selling flags in the central square. “There are many people who are hungry and it is a critical situation we are in.”Many investors have been worried about Fernandez ushering in greater state intervention, as happened under Fernandez de Kirchner during her back-to-back administrations.Fernandez, a political operator who burst into the limelight just this year, will need to balance varied demands of his broad Peronist coalition and pressure from Macri’s party, which has been weakened but is still influential.With little financial firepower, Fernandez has worker unions demanding wage increases to make up for high inflation and charities calling for an increase in subsidies for the poor.Political analyst Julio Burdman said this juggling act would be Fernandez’s biggest challenge. “He needs to do a rapid maneuver to get the economy started again, which will all depend on how he is able to handle the debt.��	-1.334557266

TOKYO (Reuters) - For most companies, trebling quarterly profit to almost $3 billion and outselling all global rivals would be welcome news. But for Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Japan's biggest car maker, it's still too early to say it has emerged from years of crisis.Toyota is likely to say later on Monday that it earned a net profit of 228.8 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in July-September, close to three times its year-ago profit when it was still reeling from the Japan earthquake and tsunami and Thai floods that ruptured its supply chain.This year has seen improved sales in the United States, Toyota’s biggest market, and in Southeast Asia. Over the first nine months of the year, Toyota and its group companies sold 7.4 million vehicles, more than any other car maker.Toyota is less likely to cut its full-year forecasts than Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, or Honda Motor Co 7267.T, which slashed its forecasts last week- even though sales in China virtually halved in September and October amid often violent protests against Japanese goods in a row over islets in the East China Sea.Due to accounting methods, the full impact of that may not be felt until the current and fourth quarters of Toyota’s business year. Toyota has around a 7 percent market share in China, the world’s biggest autos market, but is less exposed than rivals to that market. China accounted for about 12 percent of its global sales last year, some way below Nissan’s 27 percent and Honda’s 20 percent.Some experts expect Toyota, which provides more conservative forecasts than others, to offset much of the China hit through solid performances elsewhere - in the United States, Asia and in the Middle East.After a series of crises - from the global financial meltdown and damaging recalls to natural disasters and the China row - Toyota is again making money, but profitability in its core car business is much lower than its financial services unit, which brings in just 5 percent of revenue, but a quarter of operating profit.Investors and executives want to see real signs that Toyota is fixing its core problem. As the company’s president Akio Toyoda puts it: having to make “ever-better cars��.Toyota, which blazed a trail for mass producing quality cars, but then tripped up by expanding too fast into the U.S. muscular SUV and truck market at a time when the yen, too, was rising, has been on a relentless cost-paring binge.“From the Lehman shock to U.S. congressional hearings (over major 2009 recalls) and the earthquake and Thai floods, we faced many challenges and that has made us stronger,�� Vice President Mitsuhisa Kato said in August. “We are changing a lot from what we were. We want to prove how we have changed through our products, and we want to ask everyone to wait a little bit more.”One sign of change is Toyota’s more controversial designs tested on recent models. For example: the “spindle grille�� on some luxury Lexus models - a prominent grille pinched in the middle - gives the car a bolder, more aggressive look.“We are starting to think about how we can produce cars that stand out, rather than cars that are accepted by everyone but have no unique identity,�� said Toyota designer Ryo Ikeda.Another is the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), a new framework to build better cars and cut costs by developing multiple models simultaneously to use more common parts. Shared parts mean suppliers can produce a larger number of fewer parts, cutting the unit price. The framework focuses on three platforms, each carrying 8-10 models, Toyota employees said.The first car to be fully developed by the TNGA will be the revamped Prius for late-2014 release, followed by the subcompact Vitz and the next generation Camry - the perennial U.S. best-seller - around 2016, analysts said.As the global market evolves, Toyota is looking to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, and plans to double its China sales to 1.8 million cars by 2015. It has positioned Southeast Asia as a “second mother-base�� after Japan.Shares in Toyota - worth almost as much as Honda, Nissan and Hyundai Motor 005380.KS combined - are up by a fifth this year, easily outpacing Honda's 2 percent gain and Nissan's near 3 percent fall.But the U.S. market remains key to Toyota’s recovery.Toyota and Lexus�� U.S. market share jumped to 13.9 percent through October from 12.3 percent a year ago, and the brand is able to sell its mid-sized sedans with relatively low discounting. But experts question whether it can ever regain its 2009 peak share of 16.4 percent, given the increased competition.“It’s tough for Toyota to dominate the market again with its current product line-up. It needs to improve overall product attractiveness, including design and ride quality,�� said Masatoshi Nishimoto, autos analyst at IHS Automotive in Tokyo.In the past five years, South Korea's Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS have almost doubled their U.S. market share to 8.9 percent, and the Detroit Three - General Motors GM.N, Ford F.N and Chrysler - have increased their combined share to 47 percent from just above 44 percent after the global financial crisis.“All around the world, automakers were affected by multiple factors in the last four years. They are now all finally standing at the starting line ... The next few years are crucial to see if Toyota can bring its growth back on track again,�� said Nishimoto.

BEIJING, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two Chinese joint ventures sold about 74,800 vehicles in China in July, down 1.1 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Friday.That followed a 7.6 percent year-on-year fall in June and a 2.7 percent increase in May.Toyota sales have been weak in China chiefly because it is still ramping up production of the newly redesigned Corolla model, which went on sale here recently, company officials said.In the first seven months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker by sales volumr sold about 540,700 vehicles, up 9.8 percent from a year earlier.Toyota this year aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China. If accomplished, this would see the carmaker surpass annual sales of 1 million vehicles in China for the first time, a target it originally aimed for in 2010.Takanori Yokoi, Beijing-based Toyota spokesman, said Toyota is still on track to achieve the goal. “We have no plans to review or alter our sales objectives for the year,�� he said.Last year, Toyota sold 917,500 vehicles in China.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group .

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Groups representing major automakers and suppliers asked U.S. lawmakers on Friday to consider new tax relief and delay the start of a new trade deal as auto sales decline as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.The proposals come as major automakers are temporarily closing plants and cutting production. On Friday, BMW AG became the latest to announce a production halt.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation -- representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, BMW, Toyota Motor Corp and others -- and the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) in a joint letter seen by Reuters backed ""key actions"" by U.S. lawmakers to help ""ensure that sufficient liquidity remains available in the markets.""The auto groups endorsed proposals supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others to create “credit facilities to provide loans and loan guarantees to employers with more than 500 employees experiencing loss of revenue due to COVID-19.”Automakers and suppliers back a series of actions to boost the industry including delaying the planned June 1 entry into force date for the new USMCA North American trade deal. Automakers warn the fast approaching date puts undue compliance pressures on them to comply with new rules of origin.The letter supports lawmakers giving large companies a tax deduction or credit to maintain workforce, delay or defer 2020 quarterly federal tax payments, a temporary employer payroll tax holiday and to expand or extend expensing for equipment and machinery.In a separate letter to Congress on Friday seen by Reuters, Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co also supported the industry tax proposals.“The auto industry, like so many industries is going to be severely harmed by the dramatic economic downturn over the coming months,�� Honda executive vice president Rick Schostek wrote, adding that companies based outside the United States but with significant American operations should not be “arbitrarily barred from any federal assistance or regulatory relief.”On Thursday, MEMA asked lawmakers for emergency grants “to keep the doors open,�� tariff relief and other assistance to “prevent bankruptcies in the vital manufacturing sector.”Estimates for how deeply U.S. and global vehicle sales could drop vary widely. Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Thursday they were evaluating the impact of as much as a 90% drop in U.S. sales over three months. The industry letter said automakers had seen a “steep drop in retail sales over the last 10 days.��"	9.549954995

DETROIT (Reuters) - The 16-day U.S. government shutdown in early October appeared to dampen consumers�� appetite for new cars, as seven of the top eight automakers reporting monthly sales on Friday missed analysts�� expectations.Industry sales in October rose 10.6 percent to 1,208,036 vehicles, according to industry research firm Autodata. Analysts had expected a 12 percent increase.Sales for the three Detroit-based automakers, driven partly by steady demand for full-size pickup trucks, rose by double digits from a year earlier, but only General Motors Co beat expectations.October sales dipped to an annual rate of 15.23 million vehicles, according to Autodata, the lowest rate since April.The weaker-than-expected sales rate “was primarily driven by the government shutdown impacting consumer sentiment through the first half of the month,�� Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said on Friday in a briefing note to clients.Analysts had forecast stronger performances in October from Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group LLC, as well as from Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co and Volkswagen AG.GM said October sales climbed nearly 16 percent to 226,402 vehicles from 195,764 a year ago, with all four GM brands reporting year-to-year increases, led by Buick, up 31 percent. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, expected GM sales of 211,563.Results at Ford and Chrysler narrowly missed analysts�� expectations, as did those at Toyota, Honda and Nissan.Ford said October U.S. sales increased 14 percent to 191,985 vehicles, from 168,456 a year earlier. Ford and Lincoln brand sales both rose during the month. Analysts expected 194,301.Chrysler reported October sales of 140,083, up 11 percent from 126,185 a year ago. Analysts expected 143,536.Toyota sales rose 8.8 percent to 168,976 vehicles, while Honda was up 7.1 percent to 114,538 and Nissan was up 14.2 percent to 91,018. Analysts expected 176,815 at Toyota, 119,823 at Honda and 93,632 at Nissan.Hyundai Motor Co said group sales in the United States rose 0.6 percent to 93,309. Hyundai brand sales climbed 6.5 percent to 53,555 while Kia sales dropped 6.4 percent to 39,754.Analysts said vehicle demand began to pick up after the government resumed working at mid-month.“The market seemed to respond pretty quickly and the cadence (of sales) seemed to improve,�� said Itay Michaeli, analyst at Citi Research. “That, I think, is a testament to some of the pent-up demand out there.”Added GM’s chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem: “It’s like what we’ve seen with oil prices in recent years where people are getting accustomed to some of the noise coming out of Washington. It may change people’s perspective on exactly when to pull the trigger on buying a new vehicle, but we’re not seeing much of an impact on the longer-term trend, which has been very positive.”Sales of full-size pickups, buoyed by a steady housing market and lower gasoline prices, continued to show strength in October, although their torrid year-long pace slowed a bit.Ford’s F-series was up 13 percent for the month and up 20 percent for the year to date, while Chrysler’s Ram was up 18 percent for the month and 23 percent for the year to date. The Chevrolet Silverado was up 10 percent for the month and 20 percent for the year.Average transaction prices for all full-size trucks in October jumped more than 5 percentage points from a year ago, to $39,189, according to Kelley Blue Book.“The truck segment will remain hotly contested through the rest of this year,�� said analyst Alec Gutierrez of Kelley Blue Book, with GM spending less than Ford and Chrysler to promote its Silverado and Sierra.Volkswagen AG’s U.S. subsidiary said VW brand sales fell 18 percent to 28,129 vehicles. The German automaker’s upscale Audi brand reported record sales of 13,001, up 11 percent, with Porsche boosting sales 11 percent to 3,562. Group sales of 44,692 were down 9 percent from a year ago, missing analysts�� expectations of 48,654.Consumer demand for electrified vehicles remain mixed. October sales of GM’s Chevrolet Volt dropped 32 percent to 2,022, while Nissan Leaf climbed 27 percent to 2,002.With the U.S. economy still in low gear and the next round of congressional budget and debt negotiations looming in early 2014, analysts remain mixed in their longer-range outlook.“If we could ever get some strong economic footing in this country to drive lower unemployment (and higher consumer) confidence, I think we’ve got a dam that’s still waiting to burst,�� said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book.GM shares were up 1.2 percent at $37.38 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, while Ford shares were down 1.5 percent at $16.86.	-4.265987811
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday became the highest-valued automaker as its shares surged to record highs and the electric carmaker’s market capitalization overtook that of former front runner Toyota Motors Corp.Tesla shares gained 5% in early morning trade to a record of $1,133, boosting the company’s market cap to $209.47 billion - roughly $6 billion more than Toyota is currently valued by investors.Tesla is now worth more than triple the combined value of U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.The shares�� meteoric rise, up more than 163% since the start of 2020, highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla’s shift from a niche carmaker into a global leader in cleaner cars.After several years of losses, Tesla has delivered three straight profitable quarters since the third quarter of 2019 and surprised investors with solid first-quarter deliveries despite the virus outbreak.Toyota, one of the world’s most profitable automakers, sold 10.46 million vehicles during its 2019 financial year, ending on March 31, 2020. It reported net revenues of 30,226 billion yen, or roughly $281.20 billion, during that time.Tesla, in comparison, ended 2019 with $24.6 billion in revenues, having delivered 367,200 vehicles last year. Chief Executive Elon Musk in the past said Tesla would deliver at least 500,000 vehicles in 2020, a forecast the company has not changed despite the coronavirus pandemic.Tesla is expected to report second-quarter delivery numbers this week.	-4.312050004
TOKYO, April 23 (Reuters) - For a close-up view of where Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies could falter, skip across Tokyo Bay to the sprawling Kimitsu steelworks, once a must-see icon of Japan’s export boom.By the early 1970s, Kimitsu in Chiba had become the hub of the world’s largest steel operation. It provided the sheet metal for the first wave of Japanese cars sold overseas and the beams to build the first skyscrapers in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district, inspiring Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on a 1978 visit to build a copycat mill in China.But last month Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp, fresh off a merger that created the world’s second-biggest steelmaker, announced it would shut down Kimitsu’s No. 3 blast furnace, part of a sweeping restructuring meant to shed overcapacity at home in the face of unrelenting competition from China and South Korea.“It makes no sense to revive it,�� the Kimitsu plant manager, Ichiro Sato, told reporters on a tour last week. “We want to operate without bringing it back.”That same caution is echoed by Japanese manufacturers in industries from autos to electronics.Despite signs of an early stirring in consumer spending, a weaker yen and a recent rally in stock prices, companies remain deeply reluctant to invest in new plants and equipment even though the existing capital equipment -- like Japan’s workforce - is ageing.This reluctance could be the biggest challenge to Abe’s policies aimed at driving Japan out of a decade and a half of falling prices and stagnant growth by getting the Bank of Japan to flood financial markets with yen.The idea is that the BOJ’s policies will reduce long-term interest rates to make borrowing cheaper and simultaneously encourage businesses to invest by turning around long-entrenched expectations of deflation into a belief prices will rise.The risk is that unless Japanese companies and households start to borrow and invest and wages rise, the transmission between the BOJ’s monetary policy and the rest of the economy will remain uncertain.“We are not seeing many manufacturers planning production capacity increase or building new factories,�� Atsushi Miyanoya, the head of Bank of Japan’s Nagoya branch, told reporters last week. The branch oversees central Japan’s economy, a hub of manufacturers including Toyota Motor Corp.Still, Abe’s efforts have so far sent Tokyo stocks to five-year highs and weakened the Japanese currency to nearly 100 yen against the dollar, pushing up profits of many exporters, like Toyota Motor Corp. Some companies, like Bridgestone Corp, have taken advantage of low interest rates to tap the corporate bond market for funding.Abe contends that corporate appetite for capital spending has been recovering rapidly since the end of last year, although not all data supports that.Corporate sentiment has improved under Abe, the BOJ’s quarterly “tankan�� survey published this month shows. But, big companies said they planned to cut capital expenditure by 2 percent in the current business year.More than a third of companies are worried about domestic demand stagnating, a Reuters survey of 240 companies released on Friday shows. A quarter said they were likely to increase output in Japan because of the weaker yen.Longer-term comparisons also suggest Abe faces an uphill task. Capital spending in 2012 was 16 percent less than 2007. Early this year, factories were using about 19 percent less production capacity than in 2007, suggesting it will be some time before they need to invest in new industrial space.The last time when Japanese manufacturers were actively deciding to build new plants in Japan was some six years ago, when the yen was around 120 yen against the dollar. At the time, companies like Toyota, Honda Motor Co and Panasonic Corp were looking to invest in plants at home.But the yen’s rise over the following five years to a record high of 75 yen to the dollar in October 2011, raised doubts about the economics of the investment decisions and prompted a scramble to try to move production overseas.‘TIME AND EFFORT’Reflecting the pressures on Japanese manufacturers, spare production capacity at carmakers is expected to grow in the years ahead. IHS Automotive forecasts that carmakers�� 2012 capacity utilisation in Japan of 84 percent will fall to 80 percent in 2013 and to 76 percent in 2018. In 2005, the industry had been using 90 percent of its capacity in Japan.The only positive sign for new investment now, economists say, is that many companies need to invest to update outdated production equipment even if they keep output steady.“Manufacturers may not increase production capacity. But equipment is getting old, so it is going to be necessary to make changes,�� said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.Even so, manufacturers are unlikely to fundamentally increase production capacity at home because demand in Japan -- where population peaked in 2008 -- is unlikely to grow in the long run.Toyota, for one, has said it has frozen plans to build any new plants in Japan or overseas in the next three years. The automaker, which battled to keep capacity in Japan during the yen’s surge, has no plans to expand its domestic output.However, it does plan to expand output abroad, announcing on Friday that it would increase production at its existing U.S. Kentucky factory by 10 percent.“It will take a great deal of time and effort to bring back what has left Japan. The yen, which stayed below 80 against the dollar for too long, has hurt the automotive industry more so than people imagine,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in February.	10.37719143

(Adds details, analyst comment)BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s automakers saw a slow recovery of sales in China in December as buyers trickled back to showrooms lured by generous incentives, and as the bruising effects of a territorial dispute between the two countries waned.Nissan Motor, the largest Japanese vehicle maker in China, saw the decline in its Chinese sales narrow to 24 percent in December from 29.8 percent in November and 41 percent in October.Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp reported declines of 19.2 percent, 15.9 percent and 26.4 percent, respectively, slower rates of declines than in previous months.“Japanese cars have a large following in China because of their styling and fuel economy. Sales would continue to improve as long as the island dispute does not deteriorate, but it could take a while for them to recoup their market share,�� said Sheng Ye, an analyst with industry consultancy Ipsos.Some Chinese consumers have avoided Japanese cars since violent anti-Japan protests last September after Japan nationalised two East China Sea islands. China claims the islands as its own territory.In a bid to win back the hearts and wallets of Chinese drivers, Japanese carmakers have compensated owners for damage and injuries during the protests.Nissan’s China venture also offers a new car to any buyer returning a vehicle over a quality issue within seven days of purchase and with mileage below 1,000 km (600 miles). None of the carmakers has said how much the incentives have cost them so far.Japanese firms�� collective share in China’s passenger car market rose to 11.7 percent in November from 7.6 percent in October, though was still lower than 19.4 percent at the end of 2011. December market share data is not available yet.However, growth for all automakers in China is expected to be tepid this year as authorities in China look for ways to curb car buying to help ease the worsening traffic gridlock, while Japan-China tension will continue to hold back Japanese makers.Last month, Nissan sold 90,400 vehicles in China, bringing its 2012 sales to 1.18 million, down 5.3 percent year on year. The figure includes trucks and commercial vehicles.Full-year sales at its venture with Dongfeng Motor Group Co came to 773,000 vehicles, missing its 1 million annual sales target.Toyota sold a total of 840,500 cars in China last year, down 4.9 percent from 2011. Honda sold 598,577 cars in 2012, down 3.1 percent from 2011.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T slower-than-expected growth in Southeast Asia, its third biggest regional market, is becoming a headache as the world's best-selling carmaker closes on its six-year-old profit record.In ASEAN - the biggest market for Toyota after North America and Japan, overwhelming Europe or China - the company has been hurt by government policy swings in Thailand and Indonesia and underperformed industry-wide growth.In Southeast Asia’s biggest car market Thailand, Toyota sold around 237,000 vehicles in January-June, down 2 percent from the same period a year ago. That compared to an industry-wide growth of 22 percent, as it was hit by the end of a government subsidy as well as weakness in fuel-efficient small cars.In Indonesia, Toyota’s vehicle sales are likely to have increased year-on-year in the first half of 2013, but at a considerably slower pace than the market as customers hold off purchases ahead of an expected launch of a new small car.Toyota's ASEAN exposure is higher than its rivals Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T. ASEAN represents a little more than 10 percent of Toyota's total global sales.Globally, Toyota has posted a 5.4 percent rise in its biggest regional market North America in January-June as the United States is seeing the strongest pace of annual sales in more than five years.In Japan, its second largest market, sales dropped 12 percent year-on-year after green car subsidies ended last year, but it is seeing strong sales of profitable luxury models.Toyota, which is expected to this year become the first automaker to produce more than 10 million vehicles in a year, had been on track to hit or get near its record annual operating profit this financial year.But its Southeast Asian markets could get in the way.“In the short term, sales are lower than expected in these countries and that could weigh on Toyota’s business performance,�� said Issei Takahashi, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.At the same time, export dependent Southeast Asian countries are bracing for a slowdown after years of easy credit, buoyant consumer demand and strong domestic investment. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to soon start tapering its stimulus program that has fuelled the surge of credit in the region.A weakening yen that makes exports profitable and lets it convert money made overseas at a favorable rate have set Toyota nicely to boost its performance.On Friday, it is expected to post an April-June operating profit of 649 billion yen, or $6.60 billion, up 84 percent year-on-year, according to the average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.That would be the biggest quarterly operating profit in six years and just shy of its record, in April-June 2007, of $6.9 billion, or 675.4 billion yen, and is stronger than Volkswagen AG's group VOWG_p.DE April-June operating profit of $4.5 billion and General Motors Co's GM.N $1.8 billion.For the financial year ending March 2014, Toyota is likely to post an annual operating profit of $23.1 billion or 2.27 trillion yen according to an average of 26 analyst forecasts, nearing its record profit of 2.27 trillion yen it booked in the year ended March 2008.Toyota, whose Thai market share dropped to about 32 percent in January-June from around 36 percent in 2012, last month cut its 2013 sales forecast for the market by 10 percent to 450,000 vehicles, despite having raised its outlook for industry-wide sales by 8 percent to 1.3 million vehicles.Toyota lags rivals in small, fuel-efficient cars that are increasingly popular in Thailand. Rival Honda 7267.T has seen strong sales of the Brio Amaze in Thailand. Toyota has said it plans to sell a new model later this year.In Indonesia, where Toyota holds a 35 percent share, it has been hit by a delay in the implementation of the government’s Low Cost Green Car Program to promote small cars, which was recently signed into law but is still on hold pending review. The government also rolled back fuel subsidies in June.	-7.466686518
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to test how drivers could use cameras to replace traditional rearview mirrors in automobiles, a technology already allowed in other countries, the agency said on Tuesday.The planned test by the agency known as NHTSA would examine “driving behavior and lane change maneuver execution�� in cars with traditional mirrors and camera-based visibility systems, the department said in a notice offering the public a chance to comment.In March 2014, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers -- a trade group representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and others, along with Tesla Inc, petitioned NHTSA to use camera-based rear or side-vision systems. A similar petition was filed by Daimler AG in 2015 seeking approval for camera use instead of rearview mirrors in heavy-duty trucks. Those petitions are still pending.NHTSA said in a report last year it was still studying the issue. The new testing would initially focus on passenger vehicles and later on larger vehicles.Auto manufacturers have commonly added front and rear cameras to assist with maneuvers like parking, but some are now adding side cameras to provide visibility without traditional mirrors in other markets.Toyota began selling a Lexus ES in Japan last year with cameras replacing side mirrors and was followed by Volkswagen, which began selling its Audi e-tron model with cameras instead of side mirrors in Europe in December.Both sell versions in the United States with traditional mirrors.Honda Motor Co Ltd will have the technology standard on its Honda e when the model goes on sale in Europe later this year or early next year, a spokeswoman said.The technology is already approved in Europe and Japan.Mirrorless systems are “an example of where automotive technology is ahead of the legislative curve�� in the United States, said Mark Dahncke, an Audi of America spokesman.The test comes as automakers are investing in technology and autonomous driving capability.Tesla said in October it had made all eight external cameras on its Model S, Model X and Model 3 cars active, providing a ��360-degree visualization of surrounding vehicles,�� though the cars still have traditional mirrors.	4.597436488
(Adds final sales results, best rate of sales since July 2006)DETROIT, July 1 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales hit levels in June not seen since before the financial crisis that led to the bankruptcy of two American automakers, posting the best annualized figures in eight years.U.S. June sales rose 1.2 percent, beating expectations of a decline of 3 percent, and the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate hit 16.98 million vehicles, the highest since the July 2006, industry consultant Autodata Corp said.General Motors Co bucked Wall Street’s low expectations as well as negative publicity over a flood of safety recalls, reporting a 1 percent rise in U.S. sales in June. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected GM’s sales to fall about 6 percent.John Krafcik, president of car shopping site TrueCar.com, said consumers are suffering from recall “fatigue�� and tuning out the onslaught of bad news from GM and other automakers.He added that GM’s sales remain strong in part because consumers focus on brand names such as Chevrolet and Buick rather than the corporate name “General Motors.”Investors also showed faith in GM on Tuesday, sending its shares up 3 percent a day after the automaker’s total for recalls in the half-year rose to 29 million vehicles.Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co also reported year-to-year increases. They all topped analysts�� expectations, as did Ford Motor Co. Honda Motor Co Ltd sales barely missed expectations.“Sales in the first half of 2014 indicate a steadily recovering industry, and we expect this pace to increase as we move into the second part of the year,�� said Bill Fay, Toyota Division group vice president and general manager.Ford sales fell 5 percent to 222,064 vehicles, but the company still beat the analysts�� forecast of 217,007.Chrysler had a 9 percent gain to 171,086, Toyota rose 3 percent to 201,714 and Nissan was up 5 percent at 109,643.Combined Hyundai-Kia sales increased 2 percent to 118,051 vehicles.Honda sales declined 6 percent to 129,023.U.S. June sales of the Volkswagen AG group, which includes Audi and Porsche, dropped 8 percent to 49,796.Ford sales analyst Erich Merkle said the average transaction prices industry wide for pickup trucks were up more than $3,300 from a year ago. Pickup trucks are critical for the three domestic automakers because of their high profit margins.Despite substantial discounts, demand for Ford’s full-size F-series pickups - the best-selling vehicles in the industry - declined 11 percent to 60,560. The automaker is changing over to a brand-new version of the F-series for the 2015 model year.GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups sold a combined 58,925 in June, up a fraction from a year ago, while Chrysler’s Ram pickup was up 12 percent to 33,149.Ford said sales of some of its more popular U.S. models slumped in June, including Fiesta, Taurus, Mustang and Edge.At GM, key sedans Chevrolet Cruze, Impala and Malibu all had weaker sales.

DETROIT, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has alerted U.S. safety officials that seat material in several vehicles, including the top-selling Camry sedan, does not meet fire retardation standards and could result in a recall.The Japanese automaker said Thursday it has stopped selling eight recent-model vehicles equipped with seat heaters in North America following an alert from South Korean safety officials that the material did not meet their fire retardation standards, which are also used in the United States.The cars were built in the United States starting in August 2012, and some were exported to South Korea.Toyota said there have been no reports of fires or injuries related to the problem. The safety standard requires a certain burn rate as a flame moves across the seat heater’s cloth pad.Toyota said the number of affected vehicles at its U.S. dealers totaled about 36,000, or about 13 percent of dealer inventory, but that does not include vehicles in transit to dealers or those already sold to consumers. In the United States alone, the number of affected vehicles could top 111,000, according to research firm Kelley Blue Book.From the hit it took to its quality reputation during past recalls related to unintended acceleration, Toyota has learned that it cannot delay action on these issues, Kelley Blue Book analysts said. But the decision to stop selling high-volume models with seat heaters will be costly.“The timing of this issue, and its impact on Toyota’s most popular models, couldn’t be much worse,�� Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said. “Given that much of the U.S. is currently in the grips of a record cold snap, there’s sure to be high demand for models with seat heaters.“Toyota officials appear confident there is no risk and as a result they feel any hit to the company’s reputation would be short-lived and less costly than a full recall,�� he added.From late 2009 to early 2011, Toyota recalled nearly 19 million vehicles globally related to unintended acceleration claims. In 2010, Toyota President Akio Toyoda apologized for the company’s handling of the recalls and said he would insist on customer safety first.Toyota was fined $17.35 million in December 2012 for being slow on a recall, still the single highest civil penalty ever paid to NHTSA for violations stemming from a recall, according to a spokesman for the agency.In July 2013, a U.S. judge approved a settlement valued at more than $1.6 billion to resolve economic-loss claims resulting from the alleged safety defects. The company is also in the process of trying to settle related personal-injury lawsuits.Toyota spokesman John Hanson said on Thursday the company has informed the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the problem and would file an official report outlining the noncompliance with the standard. He added that Toyota did not feel a recall was necessary.“We don’t believe that it is a defect issue or a safety-related issue because there has been no occurrence of any problems out in the real world,�� said Hanson, adding that consumers can still use the seat heaters.The petition that Toyota will file with NHTSA says the problem is “inconsequential�� in relation to vehicle safety, even though the cars are no longer being sold by dealers because they do not meet U.S. safety standards, he said.The NHTSA will make the final determination on whether a recall is needed. Hanson said he did not know the timetable for that decision.NHTSA officials had no comment.Affected vehicles are the Camry mid-sized sedan, Camry hybrid, Avalon sedan, Avalon hybrid, Corolla subcompact, Sienna minivan and Tundra and Tacoma pickup trucks equipped with seat heaters that have been sold since August 2012, when the fabric supplier was changed, Hanson said.From the start of August 2012 through the end of 2013, Toyota in the United States sold 1,396,807 of the affected models, including those without seat heaters, according to Kelley Blue Book. Eight percent of the 2013 and 2014 model-year vehicles were sold with seat heaters, suggesting more than 111,000 in the United States have the noncompliant parts, KBB said.Toyota dealers have been told to stop selling any of the affected vehicles until the seat heater can be replaced, Hanson said. The automaker will address requests by individual owners to replace the part at no cost on a case-by-case basis.Toyota found out about the problem when it was notified that the seat heater did not pass a test conducted by the Korean Automotive Test and Research Institute (KATRI), which uses the same standard as NHTSA, Hanson said.	-1.010805159
In addition Fitch has affirmed the ratings of five Toyota affiliates - Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (TMCC), Toyota Motor Finance (Netherlands) B.V., Toyota Credit Canada Inc., Toyota Finance Australia Limited, and Toyota Kreditbank GmbH. A full rating breakdown is provided below.Toyota’s ratings are supported by its economies of scale, wide product range, resources to invest in various areas, as well as leadership in hybrid vehicles. Toyota also has a strong balance sheet, which provides considerable buffer against cyclical or FX fluctuations. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch’s view that the company’s financial profile, despite a challenging operating environment, will remain commensurate with the current ratings over the next 12 to 18 months.Fitch does not expect potential margin pressure from the phasing out of subsidies in Japan to erode Toyota’s robust profit given continued growth in the US and emerging markets. Strong volume growth has allowed the company to record robust operating profit in the final quarter of the financial year ended March 2012 and the first quarter of the current financial year.In the US, where the company had lost market share due to lack of inventory, Toyota has been gradually regaining market share in recent months to above 14% from a low of under 11%. The market is showing stronger-than-expected growth, with sales up 15% in the year to August. Fitch expects US, one of Toyota’s key markets, to continue to show robust growth over the medium term. It is, however, now a more crowded market with a stronger Detroit 3, and up and coming auto manufacturers such as HMC and VW, which may constrain market share recovery for Japanese automakers.Toyota exports more than half of its Japanese production, making it most vulnerable among the major three Japanese automakers to a volatile FX environment. The yen has remained stable in the year so far, albeit at a strong 78-80 to the US dollar. While the company remains committed to maintaining domestic production at three million units a year, it is taking steps to shift some of its Japanese production overseas. It is reportedly planning to cut domestic capacity to 3.1 million units by 2014 from the current 3.6 million (3.9 million pre crisis).TMCC’s and its finance affiliates�� ratings are equalised with those of Toyota, based on Fitch’s belief that TMCC is a core subsidiary to the parent company. Fitch notes that the parent has provided implicit and explicit support to TMCC and would be expected to continue to do so in times of financial distress. TMCC’s ratings also reflect the sound credit quality of its receivables portfolio, its improving operating performance, diversified funding mix and a solid liquidity profile.List of rating actions:ToyotaLong-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at ‘A��; Outlook StableSenior unsecured debt affirmed at ‘A’Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at ‘F1’TMCC, Toyota Motor Finance (Netherlands) B.V., Toyota Credit Canada Inc., Toyota Finance Australia Limited; and Toyota Kreditbank GmbH- Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at ‘A��; Outlook Stable- Short-term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at ‘F1��-Senior unsecured debt affirmed at ‘A��-Existing short-term debt affirmed at ‘F1’What Could Trigger A Rating Action?Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include-Ongoing weak profitability due to steeper-than-expected deterioration in industry fundamentals-Negative free cash flow for more than two years-Erosion in Toyota’s competitive strengths such as in its scale, breadth of product line-up, and hybrid vehiclesPositive: Positive rating actions are unlikely in the short- to medium-term given the company’s vulnerability to FX movements and the cyclicality of the automobile industry.	-9.016693067
SUZUKA Japan (Reuters) - Austrian ex-Formula One racer Alex Wurz was appointed chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers Association on Friday, replacing Spaniard Pedro de la Rosa.The GPDA said in a statement that McLaren’s Jenson Button and Red Bull’s quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel would remain as directors of a body that represents the majority of F1 drivers.“Alex will be a great GPDA Chairman. He is one of the most experienced drivers I know, full of positive new ideas, and he has seen so many different aspects of the sport throughout his career,�� said Vettel.Former Benetton, McLaren and Williams driver Wurz, who is currently competing for Toyota in the world endurance championship, hoped the GPDA could become “a more united voice for our sport��.“We know our history, we know what heroes like Stirling (Moss), Niki (Lauda) and Jackie (Stewart), Michael (Schumacher)and Ayrton (Senna) have all helped create,�� he added.“With the support of (FIA head) Jean (Todt) and (Formula One supremo) Bernie (Ecclestone), the teams, the media and most importantly with the backing of our fans, the GPDA will now aim to become a more dynamic and positive influence for the future of our sport.��	4.541559554
TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Subaru Corp aim to strengthen their partnership by investing in each other, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.Toyota would boost its stake in Subaru to more than 20% from the current 16.7%, and is set to approve the decision at a board meeting on Friday, the people said. Subaru would reciprocate with a stake in Toyota that would roughly equal the value of Toyota’s additional investment, one of them said.The sources declined to be identified because the information is not yet public.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fernando Alonso has hinted at a possible Le Mans 24 Hours entry next year as he continues to ponder his Formula One future with McLaren.The Spaniard competed in the Indianapolis 500 this year, missing the Monaco Grand Prix, but has ruled out an immediate return.Indianapolis, Le Mans and the Formula One world championship make up the so-called ‘Triple Crown�� of motorsport, a feat achieved only by the late Graham Hill and one that Alonso wants to match.“I’m still thinking, still deciding. I could have a decision already made, but there’s still some details that we need to figure out,�� Alonso said in an Instagram Live Q+A when asked about his F1 future.“My aim is to be the best driver in the world, the most complete driver in the world and for that, you need to win in different series in different cars at different times.“The Triple Crown is still a very big priority for me, so I’m working on that. I think it’s going to be a very exciting 2018 season for motorsport fans,�� added the double world champion.The 2018 Indycar calendar was published on Thursday, with the Indy 500 again clashing with Monaco on May 27, and Alonso said he had taken a look.“I think the full championship is something not in the short term that I’m thinking,�� said Alonso. “The Indianapolis 500 is something very attractive that I will do in the future. I don’t know when that future will be but I would like to have another try there.”Alonso, who retired from this year’s race with an engine failure after leading, will wear his Indy 500 helmet design again at next week’s U.S. Formula One Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.Next year’s Le Mans on June 16-17 does not clash with Formula One and comes between Canada and the French Grand Prix at Le Castellet.With champions Porsche pulling out of Le Mans as a works team, Toyota are set to be the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category if they decide to continue.Toyota would not have been an option for Alonso while McLaren were partnered by Honda but that relationship is ending with the British-based team switching to Renault engines.Toyota have said they are always willing to talk to top drivers, while McLaren have indicated they could let the Spaniard race at Le Mans for another team.“If it is something he would like to do, in the right circumstances, we would be open to that,�� McLaren executive director Zak Brown said last month.	1.823043267
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers said on Wednesday they have agreed to equip nearly all U.S. vehicles with systems to remind motorists of passengers in the back seat, by model year 2025, in an effort to avoid deaths of young children left behind in hot cars.The announcement on so-called rear seat reminder systems comes as the U.S. Congress has been debating making it a requirement for new cars.Lawmakers say more than 800 children in parked vehicles have died from heatstroke in the United States over the last two decades. U.S. regulators say 53 died last year, the most in two decades.The 20 automakers taking part represent nearly 98% of all U.S. vehicle sales and committed to include audible and visual alerts on vehicles by the 2025 model year, or a year later if a redesign is involved.The automakers include General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI said it will eventually adopt the reminder technology on all vehicles worldwide but said timing by region will vary, while in July Hyundai said it would make the systems standard on most U.S. vehicles by 2022.GM has had a system on some U.S. vehicles since 2016 that provides audible alert and a visual reminder on the vehicle dashboard to check for a child before exiting.The systems generally operate to alert a driver to the presence of a child if a rear door was opened at the start of a trip. Some vehicles have ultrasonic sensors that can detect the movements of children and pets; a Hyundai system will honk the horn and send an alert to the driver’s smartphone if it detects movement.Some safety advocates want more advanced systems that would detect the actual presence of a child in the back seat mandated.In July, the Senate Commerce Committee approved legislation to eventually require automakers to install the technology on new vehicles.U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said in an interview the voluntary agreement makes the legislation unnecessary. Under the legislation being considered, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would be compelled to write regulations and then automakers would have at least two years�� lead time.“This gives us essentially everything we’ve asked for and it does it sooner,�� said Wicker. “It is a huge win.”NHTSA plans to double its investment in its annual heatstroke awareness campaign “Where’s Baby�� and plans to convene automakers, technology companies, child product manufacturers and others for a safety summit later this month.NHTSA typically takes years to write regulations. For example, a proposal to require automakers to send email notifications of recalls has been pending for more than three years.Wicker’s bill would also direct states to use a portion of highway safety program funds to educate the public on the risks of leaving a child or unattended passenger in a vehicle, and require the Transportation Department to commission a study on retrofitting existing passenger motor vehicles.U.S. Representatives Frank Pallone and Jan Schakowsky, Democrats overseeing panels on auto issues, said in a joint statement the effort is “a big step in the right direction�� but “voluntary commitments don’t necessarily result in meaningful action.”They added Congress should “pursue legislation that requires these companies to take the necessary steps to protect children and holds the companies accountable.��	-0.01524738888
TOKYO/SHANGHAI, June 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s Daihatsu Motor Co is close to agreeing a gearbox supply deal with Chinese vehicle maker Tianjin FAW Xiali Automobile Co, a Daihatsu spokesman said on Sunday.Daihatsu, Japan’s oldest carmaker and now majority-owned by Toyota Motor Corp, is “near an agreement�� to supply Japanese-made automatic transmissions to Tianjin FAW Xiali, said spokesman Naoyuki Wakabayashi.Tianjin FAW Xiali and parent China FAW Group Corp could not be reached immediately for comment.The likely move by Daihatsu to supply a key component to Tianjin FAW Xiali is a part of its broader effort to expand businesses outside of Japan such as in China, the world’s biggest auto market, and India.While Daihatsu doesn’t rule out selling cars in more emerging markets as population shrinks in Japan, a company executive told Reuters that selling key components, such as transmissions, torque-converters and engines, has become a focus in its overseas strategy.That in part is because Daihatsu is under pressure not to cannibalise sales of small cars sold by parent Toyota in emerging markets. “That is what we believe is just about the only way for us to survive abroad,�� the executive said.Daihatsu and Tianjin FAW Xiali have not decided yet on when Daihatsu will start supplying the automatic transmission units or how many it will supply annually, the company spokesman said.This is not the first time for Daihatsu to have an interest in China. In 2007 it started to sell the locally-made Xenia minivan in China but after poor sales it dissolved the joint venture with FAW Jilin Automobile Co in 2010. The Xenia ended up competing with Toyota’s small cars, sources with knowledge of the matter have said.Daihatsu has also worked with what was Tianjin Automobile, which later became a part of the FAW Group. Nearly 30 years ago, Tianjin Automobile made the Xiali small car based on Daihatsu’s Charade through a licensing agreement.

"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - BMW BMWG.DE said on Monday the labor situation in South Africa remained ""inherently unstable"" and it had no plans to reverse a freeze on expansion, even after car parts makers ended a four-week strike.Car makers told Reuters they were hoping to return to full production later this week, after parts manufacturers agreed to a three-year wage deal with the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) on Sunday.The deal gave a breathing space to an industry that accounts for 6 percent of GDP.But prolonged labor turmoil has left some firms considering how much to invest in South Africa and BMW said last week it was no longer considering expanding production there because of the labor unrest.“The fact that the strike went on for four weeks is proof-perfect that the labor environment in South Africa in inherently unstable,�� BMW spokesman Guy Kilfoil told Reuters.“And that’s a perception - certainly in our parent company’s mind - that won’t change overnight, and certainly not by a strike ending that should have ended weeks ago,�� he added.NUMSA leaders have already dismissed BMW’s comments on freezing expansion as brinkmanship, saying the German car maker must seek the union’s approval before making any major changes to its operations.The car parts strike hit as the industry was recovering from three weeks of industrial action by more than 30,000 workers at major auto makers including BMW, Ford F.N, Toyota 7203.T and General Motors GM.N.Makers estimated that earlier strike cost them $2 billion in lost output while it was too early to estimate the impact of the latest action.“The extent and the duration of the industrial action this year has been the worst and longest on record,�� said the executive director of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers, Nico Vermeulen.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T lost production of 14,889 vehicles during the nearly two months of strikes, said spokesman Leo Kok.“We restart production with today’s night shift and hope to be up to full production later this week,�� he added.German automaker BMW aimed to be back to full production by Friday, after losing production of about 13,000 vehicles during the strikes, spokesman Kilfoil said.The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has protected the auto sector to provide relatively well-paying manufacturing jobs in a country where unemployment has been stuck at around 25 percent for years.But some car makers have long complained that wage hikes have not been met by higher productivity and labor relations are ranked as among the world’s worst in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report.Economists have said a long-standing governing alliance between the ANC and unions has led to labor-friendly legislation which has made the jobs market overly rigid and is eroding the country’s competitive edge.The central bank has been worried about the damage caused by labor strife that has slowed production in mines and factories, especially after South Africa’s trade shortfall unexpectedly widened to 19.05 billion rand ($1.90 billion) in August, the biggest gap in seven months.Workers at Anglo American Platinum AMSJ.J, the world's top platinum producer, have been on strike for more than a week in protest against planned job cuts the company says it needs to return its operations to profit.Amplats has said it is losing an average of 3,100 ounces of production a day from the strike. Gold producers and unions agreed to wage hikes of up to 8 percent last month, ending a three-day strike."	1.811125485
SYDNEY, March 12 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks plummeted on Thursday, with the major indexes at three-year lows and in bear market territory, as the United States rattled markets by announcing a ban on all travel from Europe and world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic.The benchmark Nikkei average sank 5.2% to 18,412.24 points by the midday break, its lowest level since April 2017, to fall into bear market territory.If sustained through to the end of the day, it will be the biggest one-day fall since November, 2016.The Nikkei’s volatility index, a measure of investors�� volatility expectations based on option pricing, jumped more than 10% to 52.09, its highest level since November 2011.The World Health Organization described the new coronavirus as a pandemic for the first time on Wednesday, adding that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them.U.S. President Donald Trump said late Wednesday that Washington will suspend all travel from Europe, except from the United Kingdom, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday. Trade with Europe, however, won’t be affected by the curb.He also announced some other steps, including instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments for entities hit by the virus.But investors were hardly convinced those measures will turn around the global economy as concerns grew that the number of infections could quickly snowball in many countries.“I think markets are sending a clear signal to the White House that the measures announced today were too little too late,�� said Mick McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.The broader Topix shed 4.8% to 1,318.96, its lowest since November 2016, to dive deeper into bear market.All of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange traded lower, with sea transport, real estate and precision machinery being the worst three performing sectors, while the TSE REIT index plunged 6.7%.Among major names, Toyota Motor Corp lost 4.0%, SoftBank Group Corp dived 9.0% and Yaskawa Electric Corp tumbled 7.9%.Elsewhere, the index of Mothers start-up shares tumbled 5.2% to a seven-year trough.	8.07486631
JOHANNESBURG, Sept 11 (Reuters) - A recently ended strike that hit automakers in South Africa resulted in production revenue losses of 20 billion rand ($2 billion) over four weeks, the local industry said on Wednesday.“The aggregate production losses to date, at vehicle manufacturing level, amounted to over 45,000 vehicles which translated into a production revenue loss of about 20 billion rand,�� National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) president Johan Van Zyl said in a statement.The dispute over pay, which ended at the weekend, affected more than 30,000 assembly line workers at major carmakers in South Africa, including Toyota, Ford, General Motors and Nissan.NAAMSA said auto manufacturing operations would be disrupted further by an ongoing strike in the automotive component industry that started on Monday. The vehicle and automotive component manufacturing sectors account for around 30 percent of South Africa’s manufacturing output.	3.844015567

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co tumbled to nearly the bottom of an annual survey of vehicle reliability due to flaws in its touch-screen navigation and entertainment system, while Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp swept the top three spots.In a Consumer Reports survey released Monday, Ford fell seven spots to 27th of 28 brands surveyed overall, while its upscale Lincoln brand fell 12 spots to 26th place.The results represent a dramatic drop for Ford, which placed in the top 10 two years ago, with more than 90 percent of its models being average or better.But problems with Ford’s small car transmission system and glitches in its MyFord Touch and MyLincoln Touch touch screen systems have hurt Ford’s rankings. This year, 60 percent of Ford’s models and half of the Lincoln models were rated below average and none placed above average.Ford’s worst performing model was the Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Sixteen percent of consumers who purchased an Explorer complained about the control systems, said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports director of automotive testing.The top seven spots were occupied by Japanese brands this year, the survey showed. Scion, Toyota’s youth-oriented brand, kept its place as the most reliable brand. The Toyota brand gained four spots to the No. 2 spot, while its luxury Lexus nameplate dropped one spot to third place.General Motors Co’s Cadillac was the highest-ranking U.S. brand. Audi, Volkswagen AG’s luxury brand, shot up 18 spots, the largest gain of any brand.Ford was also hurt in the rankings because three of the No. 2 U.S. automaker�� s most reliable models, the Escape crossover and Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans, were redesigned for the 2013 model year.Consumer Reports tracks consumer responses on vehicle reliability for the last three years, except those models that were redesigned for the 2013 model year.	11.66903317
* Nikkei stays below 200-day moving average* Recruit attracts buying, rises above IPO price* Fujifilm, other Ebola-related shares jump on intensifying fearsTOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average tumbled 2.2 percent to 4-1/2-month lows on Thursday hit by deepening worries about weak global growth, lifting the safe-haven yen and dragging down exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co.The Nikkei ended 335.14 points lower at 14,738.38, its lowest closing level since May 30.The benchmark stayed below its 200-day moving average for the third consecutive day.“It’s clear that people are avoiding risks,�� said Takatoshi Itoshima, chief portfolio manager at Commons Asset Management, adding that investors have started to doubt whether the U.S. economic recovery was strong enough to sustain the Japanese stock market.The U.S. economy has been a relatively bright spot in the otherwise darkening global economic picture, and investors have rushed into dollars as a result.“The yen is now strengthening without any supportive measures, so we are just going to be pushed down on moves in the yen for the time being,�� Itoshima said. “But I think selling is nearing a climax - unless there are further negative developments in global growth.”Exporters were battered, with Toyota falling 1.9 percent, Honda sinking 3.9 percent and Panasonic Corp shedding 3.6 percent.Japanese staffing firm Recruit Holdings Co Ltd surged in its market debut to 3,330 yen, compared with their IPO price of 3,100 yen.Fujifilm Holdings Corp and other Ebola-related stocks jumped on speculation over which companies would generate higher returns from fears of deadly virus Ebola intensifying in the United States.Fujifilm gained 1.8 percent and industrial air purifier maker Airtech Japan Ltd jumped 27 percent.The Topix fell 2.3 percent to 1,195.50, and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 2.2 percent to 10,891.85.

SEOUL, April 24 (Reuters) - South Korean automaker Kia Motors on Wednesday denied a media report that it aims to build a new plant in the United States by 2014 to ease a capacity shortage that has put a brake on its stellar sales growth in a key market.South Korean newspaper Financial News said on Wednesday that Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Kia Motors and affiliate Hyundai Motors, is in talks with Georgia state officials to construct the new plant, “KMMG 2�� with an output capacity of as many as 150,000 vehicles a year, without identifying sources. Ground would be broken during April to June this year at the earliest, the report said.Kia already has one factory in Georgia with a manufacturing capacity of 360,000 vehicles. That plant produces the Optima sedan, Sorento sport utility vehicle (SUV) and Hyundai’s Santa Fe SUV. Hyundai also has one U.S. factory in Alabama, which makes the Sonata sedan and the Elantra compact.“The report is all groundless,�� a Kia Motors spokesman said.The report said that in 2010, Kia internally decided to build the new production facilities in Georgia, but held off the plan because of the global economic uncertainty.Hyundai and Kia, which were the only major automakers to increase U.S. sales during the 2009 global economic downturn, have been grappling with falling U.S. sales and market share in recent months, crippled by stretched production capacity and rising competition from rivals such as Toyota Motor.The combined U.S. sales of Hyundai and Kia fell 3 percent from January to March this year from a year earlier, underperforming the recovering market.Chung Mong-koo, chairman of Hyundai Motor Group, the world’s fifth-biggest automaker, has slowed capacity addition in the past couple of years, aware that Toyota’s massive recall crisis in 2009/10 was partly a result of the Japanese firm having aggressively grown capacity.	6.336325967
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T regained the lead in global car sales over General Motors Co GM.N in the first half, with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE poised to move past GM and push the U.S. automaker into third place for the full year.The bigger question is how soon the German auto giant also will pass Toyota and secure the global sales crown �� an internal goal that VW management has targeted for 2018 as part of the company’s so-called Strategie 18.VW, in a cautious statement released Thursday, said: “The Volkswagen Group is right on track for 2018, but has not crossed the finish line yet. For us, quality takes precedence over quantity. We don’t want to be the biggest, but rather the best and most sustainable automaker in the world. For us, environmentally friendly products and satisfied customers and employees are at least as important as sales rankings and profitability.”It still has to maneuver past a resurgent Toyota, which has rebounded smartly from the effects of last year’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Toyota in February said it expects to sell a record 9.58 million vehicles globally in 2012, shattering the old mark of 9.37 million in 2007.Toyota had held the global sales crown from 2008 through 2010, before the natural disasters in Japan dropped it last year to third place, behind GM and VW.“We have recovered greatly from the earthquake and tsunami,�� said Javier Moreno, a spokesman for New York-based Toyota North America. “Our dealers now have plenty of inventory and showroom traffic is up on a global basis.”Toyota said it sold 4.97 million vehicles worldwide in the first six months, a substantial increase from the 3.72 million it sold last year, when all Japanese automakers were reeling from the earthquake’s aftermath.GM said it sold 4.67 million vehicles in the first half, up 3.0 percent from 4.54 million the previous year. GM’s global performance was driven by record first-half sales in China, which now accounts for more than 30 percent of the automaker’s worldwide total. The U.S. market, where GM’s sales are growing at a much slower pace, accounts for only 28 percent of the company’s total sales.GM spokesman James Cain on Wednesday said: “We continue to grow our sales and share in China . . . We are in the early days of the most aggressive roll out of new products in our history, which will help us press our advantage in the U.S. and China and grow profitably around the world.”VW, in a mid-year company report released Thursday, said its first-half sales totaled 4.64 million, up 12.4 percent from 4.13 million last year. But the German auto giant, which recently added sports-car maker Porsche to a diversified brand portfolio that also includes heavy-truck makers MAN and Scania, sounded a note of restraint.“Deliveries by the Volkswagen Group developed very well in the first half of the year,�� sales boss Christian Klingler told reporters earlier this month. “But that is by no means cause for euphoria. The economic situation, particularly in Western Europe, remains tense and difficult.”Klingler added: “We remain on track and are entering the second half (of the) year, which will be altogether more challenging, with confidence.”A renewed focus on the U.S. market is part of VW’s long-range plan to boost global sales to more than 10 million units by 2018, with the United States contributing at least 10 percent of that volume.Tom Libby, senior automotive analyst with Southfield, Michigan-based R.L. Polk, said VW’s management “has been very aggressive, with the U.S. playing a significant role in their global growth strategy. They have become more competitive on pricing here, and we expect their sales and share will continue to rise.��	7.228282297
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is scrambling to respond to intensifying trade pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe planning to meet the head of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T this week and business lobby Keidanren planning a Trump task force.Abe will visit Washington on Feb. 10 for talks with Trump at which the U.S. leader is expected to seek quick progress toward a two-way trade deal with Japan and discuss the automotive sector.Ahead of those talks, Abe will meet with Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda, two sources told Reuters. One of them said the meeting would take place on Friday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga denied a meeting had been set for Friday, while Toyota Motor Corp declined to comment.In a phone call with Abe on Saturday, Trump reiterated his pledge to create jobs in the United States and asked that the Japanese auto industry contribute, the Nikkei business daily reported, quoting unidentified Japanese government officials.The two leaders discussed the automotive industry, senior government spokesman Koichi Hagiuda told reporters after the phone call, without giving details. A White House statement said the two “committed to deepen the bilateral trade and investment relationship��.Japan needs to craft a plan to show that its firms, car makers especially, will contribute to creating U.S. jobs, a former Japanese diplomat said. “I think that is the only way forward to make the bilateral summit a success,�� the diplomat said.“Trump only cares about numbers. Everything has to be linked to jobs creation,�� he added. “Symbolically, autos is a very big player.”Abe has left the door open to discussing a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States, but some officials worry Japan would have little to gain while coming under intense pressure from Washington. Bilateral talks on specific sectors such as autos, however, are an option, officials have said.Trump, who last week dropped out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership pushed by his predecessor Barack Obama and favored by Abe, has repeatedly attacked Japan’s auto market as closed, in an echo of criticisms heard two decades ago.Japan has rejected that accusation, saying it does not impose tariffs on U.S. auto imports nor put up discriminatory non-tariff barriers.Over the decades, Japanese automakers have developed SUVs, mini-vans and pick-up trucks specifically targeting American consumers�� taste for bigger cars, while U.S. brands have struggled to make inroads in Japan, where drivers overwhelmingly prefer domestic brands.Foreign-branded cars accounted for only 7 percent of the Japanese passenger car market, led by Germany. American brands collectively made up less than a third of 1 percent of passenger cars sold in Japan last year.Toyota has come under fire from Trump for plans, announced in 2015, to shift production of its Corolla sedan to Mexico from Canada. Earlier this month, Japan’s top automaker said it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, the same as the previous five years.Toyota says it directly employed about 40,000 American workers as of December 2015, and indirectly more than 200,000 if dealers and suppliers are included.Japan’s biggest business lobby Keidanren wants to beef up its information gathering and analysis of the Trump administration’s policies, while also conveying data on Japan Inc’s importance to the U.S. economy, a Keidanren official said.“We will create a task force, the main purpose of which is to convey correct information about the contribution of Japanese firms in the United States,�� said another Keidanren official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to media.Japan’s government is already trying to give Trump’s administration a crash course on its companies�� contribution to U.S. jobs and growth, with fact sheets showing, among other things, that Japanese companies created 839,000 jobs in America, second only to Britain.Tokyo came under harsh U.S. criticism in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Japan accounted for up to 60 percent of the U.S. trade deficit.But now its share has shrunk to less than 10 percent, while China’s has ballooned to nearly 50 percent - something Japanese officials are trying to stress to American counterparts.Automobiles and car parts account for about three-quarters of the overall Japan-U.S. trade gap, making it an easy target.Japanese media have begun reminiscing about the heated U.S.-Japan auto talks 20 years ago. A last-minute deal in June 1995 averted U.S. tariffs on Japanese luxury cars when Japan’s automakers crafted “voluntary plans�� to boost purchases of American auto parts and expand production in the United States.	-1.145860257

(ford.to/1TXwcjf)Of the affected vehicles, 1,304 are in Canada and one is in Mexico, with the rest being in the United States.The U.S. automaker said it was not aware of any injuries associated with these passenger-side frontal airbag inflators in any Ford vehicles related to this recall.Toyota said earlier in the day that it was recalling a total of about 490,000 vehicles in Japan, China, Europe and other regions over the Takata airbag inflators.Eight automakers said on Friday they were recalling more than 12 million U.S. vehicles for the airbag inflators made by the Japanese company.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor 005380.KS posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit, but cautioned of continued weak demand and rising competition in the United States, indicating the South Korean firm was still far from being out of the woods. Run by 79-year-old founding family member Chung Mong-koo, Hyundai Motor has not posted a year-on-year rise in quarterly profit since 2014 due to its delayed response to the burgeoning demand for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in the United States.And compounding its problems has been China’s backlash over Seoul’s decision to deploy an anti-missile system, the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence, that has resulted in lower demand for Korean cars in the world’s top auto market.While the automaker has plans to bring more SUVs in the United States and China, analysts say continued weakness in the top markets has already put Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS on track to miss their global sales target for a third straight year in 2017.Hyundai, which together with Kia is the world’s fifth-largest automaker, on Thursday reported a net profit of 852 billion won ($758.21 million) for the third quarter ended September, down from 1.06 trillion won a year ago.The net profit, which reflect losses at Kia stemming from a wage dispute, came in above an average analysts�� forecast of 849 billion won. Hyundai shares rose more than 7 percent to their highest since July after the announcement.“There is a relief earnings were not worse than expected, said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manger at Seoul-based LS Asset Management. “But U.S. and China are the most important markets, and I don’t have expectations of major sales recovery in those markets for the time being.”Hyundai's China sales fell 30 percent from January to September, lagging rivals such as Honda Motor 7267.T, Toyota Motor 7203.T and General Motors GM.N that saw higher sales.To help boost China sales and in keeping with demand trends, the company plans to increase the number of SUVs it offers to 7 from the current 4 by 2020.In the United States too it wants to offer new SUV models, including Kona and Santa Fe, while “reducing inventory through flexible manufacturing��, Hyundai CFO Choi Byung-chul said.Its U.S. sales slid 13 percent over the first nine months, despite the automaker sharply boosting incentives. In the third quarter, Hyundai’s U.S. incentives rose 26 percent.“The U.S. market is expected to be challenging because of continued weakness in demand and rising competition,�� Choi said.Asian rival Toyota has launched its newest-generation mid-sized sedan in the United States, going up against the facelifted Sonata offered by Hyundai.Hyundai Motor recently replaced the heads of its China and U.S. operations in a bid to turn around its business.Hyundai and Kia, known for the top-down management style of Chairman Chung Mong-koo, are now looking to give more autonomy to regional operations so they can quickly respond to market changes while addressing slowing demand and rising competition.Hyundai shares closed up 7.4 percent, their biggest daily percentage gain since March 21, outstripping the wider market .KS11 that was down 0.5 percent. Analysts said Hyundai shares were also supported by media reports that China and South Korea were working to resolve the diplomatic standoff.	1.719822366
(Reuters) - Belgian Thierry Neuville took over the world rally championship lead for Hyundai on Sunday while Toyota’s Finnish rookie Esapekka Lappi took his first win on home soil.The 26-year-old Toyota driver beat Britain’s Elfyn Evans, in an MSport Ford, by 36 seconds in only his fourth world championship start and despite damaging his rear-left wheel in the penultimate stage.Finland’s Juho Hanninen was third, a mere 0.3 behind, in another Toyota.Neuville finished sixth but ousted previous leader Sebastien Ogier, who crashed on Friday and was unable to restart after co-driver Julien Ingrassia suffered concussion and was signed off from competing for 15 days.With three additional points from the power stage, the Belgian is now level with four times champion Ogier on 160 points but ahead 3-2 on race wins.“We set out to score more than Ogier this weekend, and we were able to achieve that.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Akebono Brake Industry Co Ltd is seeking a capital infusion from top shareholder Toyota Motor Corp and a moratorium on debt repayment as part of a revival plan, sending its shares tumbling by a quarter on Wednesday.The brake maker, a supplier to automakers including General Motors Co which makes up about a quarter of Akebono’s sales, said in a statement it has filed for assistance with a government-certified third-party body which had been accepted.Akebono, whose troubled U.S. business has hit its earnings, said it was confident its operations would be turned around under an out-of-court scheme and that it will present a revival plan to lenders at a meeting next month.The Nikkei first reported Akebono’s move to seek capital from Toyota and a debt moratorium. A spokeswoman for Akebono told Reuters that “the content written in Nikkei is true��.“We are not facing any financing issues at the moment, but we will prepare to seek assistance from our main lenders should such a situation arise,�� the company said in a statement, which did not make mention of Toyota.Toyota, which owned 11.6 percent of Akebono as of September, said in a statement it has not received a request from the brake maker for capital assistance.Founded in 1929, Akebono manufactures brakes and brake pads for passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, rolling and industrial machinery. It operates plants in Japan, North America, Europe and Asia and generates roughly half of its sales from North America, its biggest market.Besides General Motors, it also supplies Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and other major automakers.Akebono’s latest financial woes date back to around 2014, when the company was struggling to fill a surge in orders from customers in the United States, where vehicle sales were climbing to record highs.The scramble to manufacture more products beyond its production capabilities resulted in additional manufacturing costs, including labor and shipping costs, leading to a three-year run of operating losses in North America to the 2016 financial year.Years of production issues have taken also led to a slump in sales in the region, as Akebono has failed to secure orders for new models from U.S. automakers.Akebono’s shares fell as much as 26 percent on Wednesday to 158 yen, their lowest in 17 years. The shares had slid more than 40 percent in 2018.	-2.194408322

* Q4 net profit seen up 7.5 pct to $2 bln* Outlook dampened by currency moves, competition, home market* Hyundai gains in China as Japanese rivals struggleSEOUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor will report its lowest profit growth since it switched accounting rules in 2011, as record car sales are dented by the impact of a stronger local currency and the cost of compensating drivers in North America for overstated fuel-economy claims.The South Korean automaker, ranked fifth in global sales with affiliate Kia Motors, is expected to outperform the market this year in increasing vehicle sales, but a run of stellar profit growth looks set to end as currency shifts favour Japanese rivals.Hyundai will likely say later on Thursday that October-December net profit rose 7.5 percent to 2.15 trillion won ($2 billion), according to a Reuters poll of 15 analysts.“Hyundai Motor will no longer enjoy a growth-stock premium, with its earnings growth seen decelerating,�� said Kim Sung-tai, a fund manager at Phoenix Asset, which owns Hyundai stock. “The won is appreciating and Japanese and U.S. rivals are normalising into the levels before the global financial crisis.”Hyundai has relied on affordable cars to drive up sales in Europe and elsewhere, but its dominance at home - where it and Kia have 80 percent market share - is under threat from German and Japanese imports.“Hyundai’s January-March profit will fall because of currencies and increased marketing costs, as its cars are ageing and rivals have launched new models at competitive prices,�� said Cho Soo-hong, an analyst at Woori Investment &amp; Securities. That projected profit fall would be Hyundai’s first since it moved to consolidated reporting to reflect earnings at its affiliates.Analysts have cut their target share prices and earnings estimates for Hyundai as the won has strengthened, with 19 of 26 net profit estimates revised in the past 30 days, dragging down the average estimate by 10 percent, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.Hyundai and Kia shares have been the worst performers among major global automakers for the past three months - down 5 percent and 18 percent, respectively, while Toyota Motor shares gained more than a third.Hyundai is the first of Asia’s big automakers to report fourth-quarter earnings, with Honda Motor due on Jan. 31 and Toyota on Feb. 5.Hyundai’s fourth-quarter earnings could include $100 million set aside to cover the cost of compensating customers for overstated fuel-economy claims on some cars sold recently in the United States and Canada. Hyundai and Kia said they would help drivers pay for the additional fuel costs.As the Korean won has strengthened - up almost 8 percent against the dollar last year, its biggest percentage gain since 2009 - the yen has eased by 11 percent, handing the advantage back to Japanese rivals. A stronger won crimps exporters�� earnings when repatriated and hurts price competitiveness in overseas markets.Investors worry the currency shifts could prompt Japanese automakers to increase sales incentives, forcing Hyundai and others to follow suit.“Korean and Japanese currencies are going in opposite directions, which will be unfavorable to South Korean car makers,�� said Baek Jae-yeol, a fund manager at Korea Investment Management.While South Korea’s free trade deals with Europe and the United States have helped boost Hyundai and Kia sales in those markets, they are being squeezed at home.Hyundai cut its domestic prices of the mid-sized Sonata and large models such as the Genesis for the first time early this year, seeking to fend off competition from imported brands.That home market has provided the revenue firepower for Hyundai and Kia to shift mid-priced models overseas. South Korea accounted for 15 percent of Hyundai’s sales in January-September, its third biggest market after China and the U.S.Investors are also concerned Hyundai could lose production as it plans to scrap overnight work at Korean factories from March. Kia, which produced 59 percent of its vehicles at home, compared with Hyundai’s 43 percent, will be harder hit by the new shift system, analysts said.Hyundai aims to increase global sales by 6 percent to 4.66 million vehicles this year, boosted by new plants in China and Brazil. That volume increase would be the lowest since 2007 but would still top the overall industry’s projected 3.6 percent rise and Toyota’s 2.2 percent growth plan.In China, Hyundai’s third plant helped it increase output just as Japanese rivals reeled from a sales slump as a territorial row stoked anti-Japanese sentiment in September. Hyundai’s China sales jumped 16 percent last year, giving it a 6.7 percent share of the world’s biggest autos market.In Europe, Hyundai lagged its own bullish sales target, but outperformed the shrinking market with a 9 percent rise in sales and a record 3.5 percent market share, according to European Automobile Manufacturers�� Association data.In the United States, Hyundai increased sales by 9 percent last year, underperforming the market’s 13 percent rise according to Automotive News data, and saw its market share dip - to 4.9 percent from 5.1 percent in 2011 - for the first time in more than a decade.	3.843743472
Nov 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling 11,153 Scion iQ hatchbacks because the front passenger air bags might not deploy in a crash.A sensor cable may become damaged when sliding the passenger seat forward or backward on 2012 and 2013 iQs, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Thursday in its official recall notice.The defect could cause the passenger-side air bags to become deactivated or improperly activated, which could “increase the risk of injury to an occupant�� in a crash, Toyota said in a Nov. 7 letter to NHTSA.There have been no reports of injuries due to the defect.Toyota dealers will install a protective cover on the sensor cable, beginning in December.	5.481788281
SEOUL, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Shares in South Korea’s top automaker Hyundai Motor fell nearly 4 percent on Thursday as the local currency continued to strengthen, threatening to erode the carmaker’s repatriated earnings.Hyundai shares were also hurt by the weakening Japanese yen, which could raise the price competitiveness of Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor.Hyundai Motor shares traded at 208,000 Korean won ($200) per share at 0114 GMT, after touching their lowest levels since Nov. 9.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Fuji Heavy Industries 7270.T, the maker of Subaru brand cars and SUVs, has scrapped a plan to shift production of the new XV Crosstrek to its U.S. plant and will instead make the SUV in Japan, a source familiar with the company's production plans said. Fuji Heavy, which has a policy of making cars in markets where they are sold, decided to make the new vehicle in Japan because of capacity constraints in Indiana and the relatively high sales price of the crossover SUV, which makes domestic production more viable, the source said.Pricing for the Crosstrek starts at just under $25,000 for the limited edition and just under $30,000 for the hybrid version.The company had originally planned to make about 65,000 XV Crosstrek vehicles a year in Lafayette, Indiana, but will instead assemble them at its plant in Gunma prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, according to production plans reviewed by Reuters and a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named.The automaker has achieved record-breaking sales in the United States, with a 21 percent surge in the year through November compared with a year earlier.A Fuji Heavy spokesman said he could not comment on production plans for individual vehicles but said there was no change to the company’s overall strategy of localizing production.Fuji Heavy’s decision to keep Crosstrek production in Japan follows moves by other Japanese automakers to shift some production back home as the yen weakens.Since mid-October, the yen has lost about 11 percent against the U.S. dollar and now trades above 120 per dollar, its lowest since 2007.Fuji Heavy is planning to begin manufacturing the Crosstrek in Japan around April 2017, the source said.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T announced in late 2013 that it would end its arrangement with Fuji Heavy for producing Camry sedans at the Indiana plant, freeing up capacity for Subaru models. Toyota is considering moving production of some new Camrys from its Kentucky plant to Japan, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters this week.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T CEO Carlos Ghosn told reporters last week that the automaker would take advantage of the weakened yen to return production of its popular Rogue SUV to��a Japanese plant for export to the United States. 	2.93520687
TOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is set to raise its 2012 global sales forecast to 8.8 million vehicles from the 8.58 million it had announced in February as it sees solid auto sales in emerging economies, Yomiuri newspaper reported on Tuesday.The revision, to be announced as early as this week, is likely to bring Toyota’s group sales forecast close to 10 million vehicles from the current outlook of 9.58 million, the Yomiuri reported without citing a source.The group forecast includes sales at Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd.Japan’s biggest automaker did not confirm the report. “We are planning to closely study the current conditions in considering such matters,�� said Joichi Tachikawa, a spokesman at Toyota.The maker of Camry sedans and hybrid vehicle Prius regained the lead in global car sales over General Motors Co in the first half of 2012, having sold 4.97 million vehicles worldwide.That was a jump from the 3.72 million it sold last year, when the car maker was grappling with the effects of a huge earthquake that struck Japan in March.Toyota, due to report its first-quarter earnings on Friday, is expected to swing to a quarterly operating profit of 306.1 billion yen ($3.9 billion) for the three months to June, from a 108 billion yen loss in the same period a year ago, according to an estimate of seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	4.862109528

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The automotive industry's seemingly inexorable drive towards electric cars - and especially Chinese polices pushing new energy vehicles - has forced Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, the world's No.2 automaker by sales, into what one executive calls an ""agonizing"" strategy U-turn.Until recently, Toyota was one of the industry’s major hold-outs against full electrification, and planned to more or less skip all-electric battery cars and turn instead to hydrogen as a mainstream alternative to gasoline-fueled cars.In 2013, Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, father of the gasoline-electric hybrid Prius, told Reuters the hydrogen car was a “practical alternative�� to the traditional combustion engine, and if there was any use for the electric vehicle (EV),it was “only as a neighborhood errands car��.Fast-forward to late last year, and Toyota said it had begun developing a long-range all-electric battery car, which industry experts say should hit the market around 2020. The Japanese firm has put its president, Akio Toyoda, in charge of a new unit called the EV Business Planning Department.One Toyota executive, who did not want to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the strategy about-turn was “agonizing�� and “heart-wrenching��.Toyota had for some time predicted conventional hybrids and plug-in hybrids would be a medium-term bridge to hydrogen-powered cars of the future.In late 2014, Toyota launched the Mirai, a hydrogen fuel-cell car, selling in Japan for 7.24 million yen ($66,636)before subsidies and rebates. The model retails in the United States at $57,700 before subsidies.The game-changer for Toyota is China - the world’s biggest market and one where tough policies to push cleaner energy cars have challenged global automakers.Latest draft proposals from Chinese policymakers, released in September, require 8 percent of automakers�� sales to be battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles by next year, rising to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020.After some industry push back, the scale and pace of those plans may shift, but Toyota and other automakers don’t see much changing fundamentally in China’s drive to electrification by around 2020.“Those mandates are tough to the point it could wreck our fundamental business case,�� said another Toyota executive.Toyota is particularly exercised by China’s proposed policy move to categorize conventional hybrids, like the Prius, as gasoline-fueled cars. That would mean conventional hybrids would not generate what China calls new-energy vehicle (NEV)credits, which automakers could use to meet strict fuel economy rules.Under the proposals, each hybrid an automaker would sell inChina would set them back by one NEV credit point. “The Prius and other hybrid cars are central to our green car strategy,�� said one of the Toyota executives.“But in China’s view, the Prius is no more than a gasoline car. We have no choice but to get over our EV allergy and come up with an electric car.”Hiroji Onishi, the head of Toyota’s China business, said on Tuesday ahead of this week’s Shanghai auto show that the Japanese firm would start selling plug-in electric hybrid cars in China next year, and aimed to sell an all-electric battery car in China, but gave no time frame.At a briefing on Wednesday, Onishi said this wouldn’t mean Toyota will de-emphasize sales of conventional gas-electric hybrid cars in China.Because automakers in China are expected to have to meet stringent fuel-economy requirements in addition to new energy vehicle quotas in coming years, Toyota will try to sell more conventional hybrids in an effort to meet fuel economy requirements, he said.Toyota sold close to 300,000 vehicles in China inJanuary-March, up 1.7 percent on the same period a year ago."	1.41509434

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s carmakers and dealers on Thursday called for a clear, nationwide policy to combat air pollution, after a crackdown on diesel cars and trucks in New Delhi, which campaigners have vowed to extend to other cities.A Supreme Court decision on Wednesday to alleviate the smog-choked capital has unsettled India’s car industry, which says an uneven, haphazard policy makes it hard to plan investments and allows damaging regulatory arbitrage across states.“To improve the air quality ... we must take a comprehensive view of various factors causing pollution,�� said Vikram Kirloskar, vice-chairman of Toyota Motor Corp’s local unit.According to the World Health Organization, 13 of the world’s 20 most polluted cities are in India. To combat this, the government is debating policies including reducing cars in Delhi or offering cash to drivers who scrap old vehicles.But the government has yet to announce a holistic policy or target more difficult causes of pollution such as generators or even motorbikes, a family vehicle for millions of middle class Indians. Wednesday’s decision, the Supreme Court said in its order, would not hit “the common man��.New Delhi has one of the world’s worst air pollution levels, but other cities such as Patna and Kolkata in India’s east and Mumbai in the west also frequently register hazardous levels.On Thursday, according to measurements taken by the U.S. Consulate, Delhi registered an air quality index of 393 - well over the 301 level that marks “hazardous�� levels. But Kolkata was “very unhealthy�� at 212 and Mumbai “unhealthy�� at 172 - all higher than Beijing, which was at 151.“There needs to be a clearly laid out roadmap of what the government expects from the (auto) industry for the next 5-10 years, so companies get time to adapt and respond,�� said Mohit Arora, executive director at consultancy J.D. Power Asia Pacific.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at India’s Center for Science and Environment said the decision to ban large diesel vehicles in Delhi would trigger similar moves elsewhere, making a comprehensive solution essential.“We need a national solution to the diesel problem,�� she said, adding that the government should either equalize the price of petrol and diesel or tax diesel cars at a higher rate until India adopts unified, stricter emission norms.Analysts say that among those who have the most to lose from India’s haphazard policies are dealers selling cars made by Toyota, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Daimler AG’s and Tata Motors�� luxury arm, Jaguar Land Rover, brands who make large diesel cars.Dealers in Delhi are already trying to send about 2,000 unsold - now banned - diesel vehicles to other dealerships in India or back to carmakers, said K.V.S. Rao, president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA).“This is just a trigger, a starting point,�� said Rao.For Rao, a bigger worry is the call for a tax on all diesel vehicles - to be heard by the Supreme Court on Jan. 5.	-7.532759868
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor said it would develop battery electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries with BYD Co Ltd, in a sign it was ramping up partnerships with Chinese players as planned to build affordable EVs for the world’s top auto market.In a joint statement, Toyota and the Chinese electric automaker said on Friday that they would develop sedans and sport utility vehicles, which would then be sold under the Toyota brand in China before 2025.Earlier this week, Toyota announced it was teaming up with China’s Contemporary Amerex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) to supply and develop batteries for lower-emission vehicles.Widely considered a late comer in embracing battery EVs versus rivals including Nissan, Toyota had flagged in June that it aimed to get half of its global sales from EVs, including gasoline hybrids, by 2025, five years ahead of schedule.But to meet this accelerated timeline, Toyota, Japan’s top automaker, would need more-than-expected batteries, prompting it to look beyond Panasonic Corp, its long-time partner in battery development, to secure supply.These measures come amid a breakneck growth in the zero-emission vehicle market, with tighter global emissions regulations expected to shift even more drivers away from gasoline engine vehicles in the coming decades.In China, Toyota is planning to launch its first battery EV, a version of its C-HR/IZOA compact crossover, next year.	-1.143815769

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Thursday it will make automatic emergency brakes standard on two key 2019 models, an effort by the No. 2 U.S. automaker to catch up with rivals in offering the new technology designed to help vehicles avoid collisions. Ford will fit the brakes on its redesigned 2019 Edge midsize crossover vehicle and its new 2019 Ranger midsize pickup, that will compete later this year with the Chevrolet Colorado and Toyota Tacoma.The brakes are part of a suite of standard safety features on the new Edge, Ford said, including technology that detects objects and pedestrians and can prevent collisions by automatically braking and steering for the driver.The 2019 Edge, which goes on sale this summer, will also offer new optional safety features, including a more sophisticated cruise control system as well as automatic steering assist to help avoid potential crashes.In an update last month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said four of 20 automakers in 2017 equipped at least half of their U.S. models with standard automatic emergency brakes, with the highest installation rates for luxury brands such as Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz. Among mass-market companies, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T fitted the devices to 56 percent of its 2017 fleet, compared with 30 percent for Honda Motor Co 7267.T, 20 percent for General Motors Co GM.N and less than 10 percent for Ford.Overall, 20 carmakers have agreed to equip virtually all of their new passenger vehicles with automatic emergency brakes by September 2022, NHTSA said.In an interview, Raj Nair, president of Ford’s North American operations, said the company plans to be “more aggressive�� in standardizing features that assist drivers. He declined to say when Ford planned to make automatic emergency brakes standard on all its U.S. models.	1.351252648

(This October 4 story corrects paragraph 17 to show Toyota has partnership, not investment, in Didi Chuxing.)TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T are teaming up to develop self-driving car services, signaling deepening alliances between top automakers and tech firms as the global race to develop autonomous cars intensifies.Japan’s biggest automaker and its most influential tech firm will jointly develop a platform to operate self-driving vehicles which can be used as mobile shops, hospitals and other services as they envision a future in which fewer people drive their own vehicles.The tie-up shows that even big, well-funded firms want to share costs and expertise in pursuing promising but risky automotive technologies that have yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance.The joint venture will start small with initial capital of 2 billion yen ($17.5 million). SoftBank will own just over half of the business, which will initially focus on Japan and eventually go global.“SoftBank alone and automakers alone can’t do everything,�� said Junichi Miyakawa, chief technology officer at SoftBank Corp who will be CEO of the new company. “We want to work to help people with limited access to transportation.”The partnership will see Toyota and SoftBank work together to develop the automaker’s multi-purpose mobility service based on its “e-Palette�� concept announced earlier this year, in which Toyota plans to produce the hardware and software for convoys of shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles used, for instance, as pay-per-use mobile restaurants and hotels.The joint company will be called MONET, short for mobility network, and will roll out an autonomous driving service using e-Palette by the second half of the 2020s, the companies said.SoftBank will provide technology to collect and analyze transportation data to ensure cars are efficiently dispatched when and where they’re needed, they said.“Toyota is hoping to increase its revenues by combining its own data with the data and expertise which SoftBank has culled from its mobile phone operations,�� said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities.“The new company will enable SoftBank to widen its partner network, and it could be hoping to take a lead in developing platforms (for new transport services).”A slew of automotive technology-related deals and discussions have already resulted in myriad pairings between global automakers, ride-hailing companies and major tech firms.Honda Motor 7267.T said on Wednesday it would invest $2.75 billion and take a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise self-driving vehicle unit, in which SoftBank is also an investor.On the same day, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and Renault SA RENA.PA said they may expand their cooperation to batteries, self-driving vehicles and mobility services.The partnership between the two Japanese companies reflects SoftBank’s growing influence in the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, which has been accelerated by its investments via the almost $100 billion Vision Fund.It is also a vote of confidence from SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has been critical of Japan for lagging overseas rivals, in Toyota’s vision for the future of cars.“He has an image of the future,�� Son told a media briefing, referring to Toyota President Akio Toyoda. “Automobiles are becoming a cluster of semiconductors, not screws, bolts and nuts.”While both firms have been independently developing technologies for self-driving vehicles and car sharing, and each have investments in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and Grab, this is first time they have come together. SoftBank is also an investor in Didi Chuxing, while Toyota has a partnership with the Chinese ride-sharing company.Toyota Executive Vice-president Shigeki Tomoyama said the partnership came after SoftBank’s widespread presence in the ride-hailing industry became apparent - it holds major stakes in the ride-hailing firms it had invested in and played a consolidating role in that industry.Toyoda joked about rumors that the two companies did not get along, and recalled rejecting a business proposition from Son 20 years ago, when SoftBank had yet to make its name as one of the world’s largest technology investors.“We are trying to take traditional car making into new fields,�� he told reporters. “We realized that SoftBank shares the same vision when it comes to the future of cars, so it’s time that we partner together.��	-5.541005074
(Reuters) - Canadian police said on Wednesday they found two bodies that they believe are of the fugitive teenage boys charged with killing a university lecturer and suspected in the murders of two tourists in British Columbia.Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, both from Port Alberni, British Columbia, fled from British Columbia to Manitoba and were the target of an intense three-week manhunt.Police declined to disclose how the two died, saying that they would wait for autopsies to confirm their identities and cause of death.The pair was charged with second-degree murder in July of Leonard Dyck, 64, a botany lecturer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. They are also suspects in the murders of Chynna Deese, 24, of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Lucas Fowler, 23, from Sydney, Australia.The bodies of McLeod and Schmegelsky were found near Gillam, Manitoba, 1 km (0.6 mile) from where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) discovered “significant evidence�� on Friday and 8 km (5 miles) from where McLeod and Schmegelsky’s burning car was found on July 22, police said.The evidence, which the RCMP declined to describe, proved to be “critical�� in finding the bodies, Jane MacLatchy, RCMP assistant commissioner in Manitoba, told a news conference in Winnipeg.Searchers had to contend with difficult terrain and thick forest. Linking arms and traversing ground, as is normally done in search operations, was out of the question, MacLatchy said.Authorities were relieved that the alleged killers were found, she said, and hoped it ended a difficult period for victims�� families and the Manitoba communities of Gillam, Fox Lake and York Landing that were at the center of the manhunt.“It’s huge to be able to give people a chance to exhale and to go back to normal and not be afraid of who’s out in the woods anymore,�� she said.RCMP amassed a heavy presence around Gillam after the gray Toyota RAV4 driven by Schmegelsky and McLeod was found in flames on the highway between Gillam and Fox Lake, a small indigenous community to the north, on July 22.At its peak, the investigation included members of the Canadian air force and military, as well as drones, dogs, emergency crews and RCMP major crime units.The search weighed heavily on the tiny, remote communities of northern Manitoba as residents suddenly found themselves host to police and military personnel.John McDonald, deputy mayor of Gillam, said the town was relieved the search was over, and leaders of the Cree indigenous communities in York Landing and Fox Lake requested trauma counseling for their members.“It may take some time for people to recover from the trauma caused by this lengthy manhunt,�� said Grand Chief Garrison Settee, leader of an indigenous advocacy group in Manitoba.British Columbia RCMP said at a press conference that the investigations into the deaths of Dyck, Deese and Fowler continued.	2.690374952
Erik Jones, 17, becomes youngest truck series winnerBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeAVONDALE, Ariz. -- In a battle between two drivers who had never won a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race, 17-year-old Erik Jones pulled away from Ross Chastain in the final 10 laps of Friday night’s Lucas Oil 150, becoming the youngest winner in series history.Driving the No. 51 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota, Jones took the lead on Lap 142 of 150, powering to the inside of Chastain through the dogleg on the backstretch. Born May 30, 1986, Jones eclipsed Chase Elliott, a winner earlier this year at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, as the youngest winner in the truck series.With a fifth-place run, Matt Crafton moved closer to the series championship, ending the evening 46 points ahead of Ty Dillon, who finished fourth. To secure the title, Crafton has to only start next Friday’s race at Homestead-Miami Speedway.James Buescher, who entered the race second in points, came home ninth and was eliminated from championship contention. Veteran Brendan Gaughan ran third behind Jones and Chastain.Jones and Chastain swapped the lead through a series of late-race cautions before Jones made the winning pass and pulled away. After the final restart on Lap 141, Chastain blocked a strong run by Jones at the top the track, a move that made Jones all the more determined to win the race.“On the last restart, we stayed with him through (Turns) 1 and 2 on the top side,�� Jones said. “He squeezed us up -- but that’s racing with 10 to go. You can’t blame him for that. But when something like that happens, it makes you more determined than you were before.“I was really determined after that to go back and get it. I really felt like we had a better truck from the previous restart, and I really felt like it was our race all day and didn’t want to let it slip away.”Jones lost the lead to Chastain during pit stops under caution on Lap 89, the yellow flag necessitated by Ron Hornaday’s hard crash into the Turn 4 wall. After his release from the infield care center following the wreck that ended his race, Hornaday revealed that he had been released from his ride in the No. 9 NTS Motorsports truck and will drive for Turner Scott Motorsports in the season finale.As soon as the green flag waved, however, Jones powered to the outside of Chastain after a restart on Lap 94 and cleared the No. 19 by the time the trucks exited Turn 2.Jones opened a lead of 3.2 seconds before debris from Joey Coulter’s truck caused the fourth caution of the night on Lap 112. Chastain grabbed the lead from the inside lane after the Lap 120 restart moments before John Wes Townley’s spin into the outside wall caused the sixth caution.Chastain held the top spot on Lap 134, when Timothy Peters�� truck got loose beneath that of fellow Toyota driver Darrell Wallace Jr. and sent both trucks spinning.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race - Lucas Oil 150Phoenix International RacewayAvondale, ArizonaFriday, Nov. 8, 20131.

BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The man who led the development of Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Prius hybrid car is set to become the Japanese automaker's chairman as early as this year, said two senior executives familiar with the matter, in a boardroom shuffle that should do little to lessen president Akio Toyoda's grip.A final decision to appoint Takeshi Uchiyamada, 66, to what is effectively the No.2 position in many Japanese firms has not yet been made and the promotion could still be postponed for a year.But it’s already been an “established direction�� and a “given�� since last year that Uchiyamada, vice chairman since June, would replace Fujio Cho, who has been chairman since 2006, said the executives, who didn’t want to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media.A Toyota spokesman declined to comment.One of the knowledgeable company executives described Uchiyamada’s promotion as being a “highly anticipated�� move since last year when Toyota asked Cho to serve one more year as chairman. Cho, a 75-year-old Toyota veteran who was company president from 1999 to 2005, would become a senior adviser.Toyoda, grandson of the automaker’s founder, considers Cho a lynchpin of his power and support base inside Toyota and may even ask him to stay on for yet another year as chairman, even though Cho has recurring back pain and has said he wants to retire, the two executives said.Toyoda’s grip on the company’s management team and board should not be impacted, they said. “It’s a case of a pro-Akio executive replacing another Akio supporter as chairman,�� said one. “This isn’t going to change the whole scheme of things at Toyota.”Japan’s Nikkei economic daily reported late on Monday that Toyota had picked Uchiyamada to replace Cho this year.In many Japanese companies, including Toyota, the chairman’s role is often to take charge of external affairs, such as government and industry affairs, while the president runs day-to-day operations. Cho has served as chairman of the Japan-China Economic Association since 2007 and is chairman of the Japan Sports Association. He has also served as a vice chairman for Keidanren, Japan’s main business lobby.The Nikkei said in its report that Uchiyamada was likely to become vice chairman of Keidanren.Uchiyamada, an experienced vehicle engineer, was a prime mover behind the first-generation Prius in the 1990s - a car that has gone on to become the world’s best-selling hybrid. He also supervised Toyota’s manufacturing division, and was named as executive vice president in 2005.Toyota, the world's largest car maker by volume sales, blazed a trail for mass producing quality cars, but tripped up by expanding too fast into the U.S. muscular SUV and truck market at a time when the yen was rising. It was also hit by a reputation-denting mass recall and severe supply problems after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. It has since rebounded, helped by a relentless cost-paring drive, but remains under pressure from rivals such as Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS.Uchiyamada graduated from Nagoya University with a degree in applied physics in 1969 and joined Toyota a month later.	6.611831699
Dec 3 (Reuters) - Canada’s auto sales fell for the eighth straight month in November, as a rise in interest rates dampened demand for new cars.Total auto sales tumbled 9.4 percent to 143,668 units according to a report by Global Automakers Canada (GAC). (bit.ly/2zPcUKb)Despite an increase in consumer confidence of over two points in November that has not translated into higher vehicle sales, Global Automakers Canada President David Adams saidThe Bank of Canada raised interest rates in October, its fifth hike in 16 months, and signaled more rate hikes to come in 2019 as it looks to meet its inflation target.General Motors Co, the country’s biggest carmaker, reported an 18.3 percent drop in sales.Last week, GM announced the closure of its Oshawa plant, which came as a blow to workers in Canada.The decision is part of a wider restructuring, affecting nearly 3,000 assemblyline jobs in the Ontario city out of the automaker's Canadian workforce of 8,150. (bit.ly/2Q812wO)Toyota Motor Corp reported a 10.4 percent rise in monthly sales to 18,731 units, according to the data published by GAC.Earlier in the day, top U.S. automakers including General Motors, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler reported better-than-expected sales driven by the holiday season deals.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler FCAU.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Renault RENA.PA announced on Friday they will stop auto production in Brazil temporarily due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this week, General Motors Co GM.N and Mercedes Benz said they would also stop production. Volkswagen VOWG.DE and Volvo VOLVb.ST have also announced at least temporary production halts in Brazil. The closures in Brazil have come shortly after automakers in the United States and the European Union announced similar measures.Stephanie Brinley from IHS Markit said they are currently expecting auto production in South America to fall by about 98,000 units in March and April.“I’m pretty sure that by Monday noon that number will be revised,�� Brinley said. “It’s a very fluid situation.Brazil is by far the continent’s largest auto producer, but Argentina also has a sizable output.	9.549954995
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T reported a drop in quarterly operating profit on Monday but still added 9.7 percent to its full-year earnings forecast as the world's No. 2 automaker expects a bigger reprieve from a weakening yen.The manufacturer also said it had “no immediate plans�� to change its policy of producing an annual 3 million vehicles at home in Japan, many of which are shipped to the United States, even after criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump for the number of cars it exports to the country.The results come as Toyota braces for profit to tumble from last year’s record 2.31 trillion yen. However, its outlook has improved as it anticipates the domestic currency to stabilize following volatility seen earlier in the financial year.“We’ve revised our full-year yen forecast to 107 yen to the U.S. dollar from 103 yen, which is the biggest contributing factor to our profit forecast revision,�� Managing Officer Tetsuya Otake told reporters.Toyota now expects net profit of 1.7 trillion yen ($15.08 billion) for the year ending March, a decline of 26 percent from a record set a year earlier. It also sees operating profit of 1.85 trillion yen, 8.8 percent more than forecast in November.For the three months ended Dec. 31, however, a stronger yen knocked 770 billion yen off earnings. That pushed operating profit to 438.5 billion yen from 722.2 billion a year earlier, below a median forecast of 483.57 billion yen drawn from 11 analysts in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/ poll.The rosier profit outlook comes as Toyota expects to sell slightly more cars globally than previously forecast. It now forecasts sales in North America, its biggest market, to be a touch higher than last year, fueled by demand for larger cars.Toyota has been working to supply more sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to the United States where demand for larger models has surged due to historically low gasoline prices. Such is the demand that Toyota has shifted production in the region away from its staple sedans.It has also increased imports of its RAV4 SUV crossover from Canada and Tacoma pick-up truck from Mexico.U.S. President Trump has taken issue with the proportion of cars domestic automakers import rather than produce locally, considering the size of sales in the world’s second-biggest market.Toyota imported about half of the record 2.449 million vehicles it sold in the country last year, including 26 percent from Japan.But Toyota on Monday said it would stick to its long-held policy of keeping around one-third of production at home as a way to continually hone the country’s manufacturing expertise.Japan’s automotive exports are likely to be high on the agenda when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets with Trump for summit talks in Washington later this week.	-0.7519462137
MELBOURNE, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Monday it will stop making cars in Australia from 2017 following the planned exits of General Motors and Ford .“We did everything that we could to transform our business, but the reality is that there are too many factors beyond our control that make it unviable to build cars in Australia,�� Toyota Australia President Max Yasuda said in a statement.About 2,500 jobs will be affected when the plant stops building cars in 2017, the company said.	-4.90430622
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it would make 10% fewer vehicles next month than originally planned, as it gradually resumes output following factory closures earlier this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Japanese automaker said it planned to make 71,000 fewer vehicles globally in July than its original goal of about 700,000. While production has yet to return to normal, the July reduction is smaller than the 20% output cut for June.“We expect the recovery trend to continue in August,�� a spokesman said.Global automakers are trying to get their plants back up and running after many were closed earlier this year to curb the spread of the virus.For the April-July period, Toyota anticipates a global production drop of 30% from its initial plans, made before the virus outbreak and a plunge in demand for vehicles.The automaker produced nearly 3.7 million vehicles during the same period last year.At home, Toyota plans to make 39,000 fewer vehicles in July, or 10% less than initially planned.It will stop making its Coaster minibus model for six days, while lines producing the Land Cruiser and Prado SUV models, and the Porte subcompact, will stop for two days. These adjustments will affect six production lines at three of the automaker’s plants.Second shifts at some of these plants will remain cancelled, potentially until September. In total, Toyota operates 28 production lines at 15 vehicle factories in Japan.Toyota will also cancel some Saturday shifts next month on four lines that produce models including its popular RAV4 SUV crossover model and the Prius gasoline hybrid, many of which are exported overseas.	-2.502130297
Cindric clinches Trucks playoff spot with win in CanadaBy Stephanie Wallcraft, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeBOWMANVILLE, Ontario -- Canadian Tire Motorsport Park has a knack for hosting dramatic finishes, and Austin Cindric created one of his own in the Chevrolet Silverado 250 on Sunday at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park.A dramatic last-lap incident saw Cindric push his car into the back of Kaz Grala’s car to push his way past and punch his ticket into the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series playoffs by claiming his first victory of the year.Cindric started the final lap of the 64-lap race less than a truck length behind Grala, and by the time the two rookie racers had reached the back of the circuit at Turn 5 they were nose to tailgate.Cindric made square front-to-back contact with Grala and sent him sideways, which allowed him to move past into the lead and eventually into Victory Lane.“I wanted to pass him clean because I’m all about that,�� Cindric said. “I feel like this is what NASCAR racing is about. You have to win to make a playoff position. You can’t finish second.“Everyone (who has won at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park) made the move in the last corner. I figured I might as well change that.”Noah Gragson squeezed by Grala’s skid to finish second, and Grala recovered and ended the day in third.“He didn’t even attempt to pass,�� Grala said of the incident. “He just drove right in there and used me as his brakes, turned me straight around and gave me no opportunity.“Just a dirty move. I’ve got a lot of respect for him as a road course racer but lost a lot today.”Cindric’s victory was made all the more remarkable by how much ground he was forced to recover after a mid-race penalty.After starting on the pole and winning a caution-free first stage -- which earned him his first playoff point of the season -- Cindric pitted on Lap 32 and left his stall with the fuel canister still attached, drawing a stop-and-go penalty.Because of the length of the 2.45-mile road course, he was able to stay on the lead lap, but he rejoined deep in the field.By five laps into the final stage, he had worked his way back into the top 10. Five laps later, he was back in the top five. And after he pushed his way past Gragson for second on lap 61, he was able to make steady gains onr the final three laps to position himself to make his move on Grala.Rounding out the top 10 were Justin Haley, Ryan Truex, Johnny Sauter, Chase Briscoe, Parker Kligerman, Austin Wayne Self, and Ben Rhodes.The Chevrolet Silverado 250 was the second-to-last race before the start of the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series playoffs. The final chance for drivers to land a berth comes Sept. 15 at the Chicagoland 225.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- Chevrolet Silverado 250Canadian Tire Motorsport ParkBowmanville, OntarioSunday, September 3, 20171.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, one of the world’s largest automakers, and Japan’s space agency said on Tuesday they had agreed to cooperate in developing a manned lunar rover that runs on fuel cell technologies.Although Japan has no plan currently to make a manned rocket that could send people into space, the rover could be a major contribution to an international space probe program in the future, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said.The rover “will be an important element supporting human lunar exploration, which we envision will take place in the 2030s��, JAXA Vice President Koichi Wakata told a symposium in Tokyo.“We aim to launch such a rover into space in 2029.”The rover is still in the conceptual stage, but an illustration in the news release showed a six-wheel vehicle that somewhat resembled an armored personnel carrier.A spokesman for Toyota, which plans to ramp up fuel-cell cars as a zero-emission alternative to gasoline vehicles, said the project would give the company a chance to test its technologies in the moon’s harsh environment and improve them.Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi stressed the excitement that comes with taking part in a space project.“As an engineer, there is no greater joy than being able to participate in a lunar project by way of Toyota’s car-making,�� Terashi told the symposium.“Being allowed to be a member of ‘Team Japan��, we would like to take up the challenge of space,�� he said.	2.589891878
(Adds details, background on Japanese automakers shifting production home)TOKYO, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru brand cars and SUVs, has scrapped a plan to shift production of the new XV Crosstrek to its U.S. plant and will instead make the SUV in Japan, a source familiar with the company’s production plans said.Fuji Heavy, which has a policy of making cars in markets where they are sold, decided to make the new vehicle in Japan because of capacity constraints in Indiana and the relatively high sales price of the crossover SUV, which makes domestic production more viable, the source said.Pricing for the Crosstrek starts at just under $25,000 for the limited edition and just under $30,000 for the hybrid version.The company had originally planned to make about 65,000 XV Crosstrek vehicles a year in Lafayette, Indiana, but will instead assemble them at its plant in Gunma prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, according to production plans reviewed by Reuters and a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named.The automaker has achieved record-breaking sales in the United States, with a 21 percent surge in the year through November compared with a year earlier.A Fuji Heavy spokesman said he could not comment on production plans for individual vehicles but said there was no change to the company’s overall strategy of localising production.Fuji Heavy’s decision to keep Crosstrek production in Japan follows moves by other Japanese automakers to shift some production back home as the yen weakens.Since mid-October, the yen has lost about 11 percent against the U.S. dollar and now trades above 120 per dollar, its lowest since 2007.Fuji Heavy is planning to begin manufacturing the Crosstrek in Japan around April 2017, the source said.Toyota Motor Corp announced in late 2013 that it would end its arrangement with Fuji Heavy for producing Camry sedans at the Indiana plant, freeing up capacity for Subaru models.Toyota is considering moving production of some new Camrys from its Kentucky plant to Japan, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters this week.Nissan Motor Co CEO Carlos Ghosn told reporters last week that the automaker would take advantage of the weakened yen to return production of its popular Rogue SUV to a Japanese plant for export to the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Thursday said it was moving to allow advanced headlights known as “adaptive driving beams�� to be used in vehicles on U.S. roads that could help prevent nighttime crashes.The agency said it was acting in response to a petition filed by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T in 2013 to allow the lights, which provide more illumination than existing lights without a glare to oncoming motorists by using additional sensors to automatically adjust lights. NHTSA said the lights offer “potentially significant safety benefits in avoiding collisions with pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and roadside objects.”The headlights have been permitted in Europe for more than a decade and are also allowed in Japan and other countries.Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE also petitioned the agency in 2016 to allow the lights on its Audi A7 luxury cars, while BMW AG BMWG.DE filed a similar petition in October 2017.The problem is the lights ran afoul of U.S. rules setting maximum levels for lower beams.The agency noted that a recent study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that pedestrian deaths in dark conditions jumped 56 percent from 2009 to 2016.At the direction of Congress, NHTSA began extensive research into the impact of nighttime glare in 2005.Unlike some automatic headlight switch systems from high to low beams, adaptive headlights use sensors, cameras, data-processing software, and headlamp hardware to detect oncoming and preceding vehicles and automatically adjust the headlamp beams.NHTSA said it was proposing to amend current safety rules that bar the advanced lights but will still need to take final action after receiving public comment before it can the allow the new lights. The agency is also proposing new test measures to ensure the systems work as planned.NHTSA has received thousands of complaints about headlight glare over the last four decades, especially with the introduction of halogen lights in the late 1970s and then high-intensity discharge lights in the 1990s.	-1.019184652
DETROIT, July 25 (Reuters) - General Motors Co.’s Chevrolet Impala has been tapped by Consumer Reports as the top sedan in the United States, seizing a spot dominated by Japanese and European models for more than two decades.The influential consumer magazine said the redesigned 2014 Impala was not only the top large sedan, with a score of 95 of a possible 100 points, but also among the top-rated vehicles it has tested. Only Tesla’s Model S hatchback (99 points) and BMW’s 135i coupe (97) scored higher.The ranking by Consumer Reports is the latest symbol of GM’s effort to improve consumers�� perception of its brands. The Impala historically was better known for its image as king of the rental cars.“It just shows that GM is back and they’re making really desirable vehicles,�� Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, said in a telephone interview. “What’s really amazing about it is the vehicle in one year went from one of the worst vehicles in its category to the best.”The 2013 Impala scored 63 points in Consumer Reports testing.Fisher said the new Impala’s performance is part of a renaissance by U.S. automakers that includes such redesigned vehicles as the Chrysler 300 sedan, Ford Escape SUV and Fusion sedan, and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV.The Impala’s recognition follows GM’s performance last month in a widely followed J.D. Power and Associates study. In that firm’s initial quality survey, the Detroit automaker had eight cars and trucks named best in their segment in the U.S. auto market and its mainstream Chevy brand jumped 10 spots to No. 5 among 33 brands.The high rankings for its vehicles is welcome news for a company trying to put its 2009 bankruptcy and $49.5 billion U.S. taxpayer-funded bailout behind it.Impala used to get 70 percent of its sales from fleet customers, like car rental companies, and 30 percent from consumers, but GM officials want to flip that ratio. The car competes with the Ford Taurus and Toyota Avalon.Consumer Reports has been testing and reviewing cars for more than 75 years, but started giving them numerical scores and compiling ratings charts in only 1992. In that time, the top-scoring sedan spot has been held 12 times by Japanese models and nine times by European ones.Overall, Consumer Reports said it found the 2014 Impala competitive with cars that cost $20,000 more, including the Audi A6, Lexus LS460L, Acura RLX and Jaguar XF. Fisher said many high-end cars suffer from over-complexity, while the new Impala has many nice features but remains easy to use.The magazine praised the new Impala for its luxurious feel; spacious and high-quality interior; easy-to-use and intuitive controls; and strong handling and braking. It said the car’s 22 miles per gallon fuel efficiency as rated by the magazine was competitive but not best in class.However, since it is so new, there is no reliability data for the Impala and Consumer Reports did not add the large sedan to its “recommended�� list. To achieve that, a vehicle must perform well in the magazine’s testing, have average or better reliability and perform well in government and industry crash tests.In other testing, Consumer Reports said the redesigned, seven-passenger version of the Hyundai Santa Fe now ranks as the top mid-sized SUV ahead of the Toyota Highlander. The magazine also tested the 2014 Kia Forte compact car, saying it was vastly improved from the previous model and slightly better than the Hyundai Elantra on which it is based.Complete results for the Impala and other vehicles recently tested appear on www.ConsumerReports.org and in the September issue of the magazine.	0.5622941602
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Inc is under pressure to boost pay to keep a fragile economic recovery afloat, but even hefty wages increases from the biggest companies may prove to be a hollow victory for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the bulk of the country’s workers.As the annual “shunto�� Spring wage bargaining season begins, the pay prospects for employees of blue-chips such as Toyota look better than they have for more than a decade, thanks to Abe’s push for higher wages that will boost consumer spending.That optimism has not spread to workers such as those at Nihon Kikai Kogyo Co, who build fire trucks in a cluster of workshops an hour’s drive from Tokyo and whose union says are yet to see any trickle-down benefits from “Abenomics��.“Last year in pay talks we reminded the company about Abe’s call for higher wages, but management told us it was immaterial,�� said Hironobu Yamaguchi, Secretary General of the union that represents 124 of Nihon Kikai’s 155-strong workforce.“We expect the same answer this year,�� he added, sipping green tea in a wooden shack that doubles as the union office and company snack shop.The contrast highlights a major policy challenge facing Abe in his drive to lift the world’s third-biggest economy decisively out of years of deflation and fitful growth.Around 70 percent of Japanese workers are employed by small and medium sized firms, and economists say generosity from a few corporate titans will not deliver a consumer-led revival while the majority of firms keep their purse strings tight.“The government is asking a small number of large firms, particularly large exporters that are doing extremely well in terms of profits, to raise wages,�� said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas Securities.“The prime minister may have some success, but at the macro level the impact is limited.”Pay talks at Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, widely seen as a bellwether for Japan's big firms, got under way on Wednesday.Emboldened by Abe’s call for corporate Japan to do its part for the economy, workers at Japan’s eight automakers are all seeking base wage hikes of 6,000 yen ($50) a month - around 1.7 percent - about two to three times more than the additional pay they received last year. [ID:nL4N0VZ1E7Toyota’s workers want another 7,300 yen on top of that in seniority-related raises and a one-off bonus equivalent to 6.8 months�� worth of salary. The company said the total wage hike workers were asking for was equivalent to a 3.7 percent raise.“The request was far higher than what we had expected, so we conveyed to them that ... it was totally impossible to meet the demands in full,�� Tatsuro Ueda, managing officer in charge of human resources, told reporters at Toyota’s headquarters.While the government argues higher wages at large firms will filter down the supply chain, union representatives, and some economists, instead see it leading to a widening pay gap between workers at the top and bottom of Japan’s corporate pyramid.“Normally you raise productivity and then wages rise, but the government has the cart before the horse by asking companies to raise wages again,�� said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.“Companies won’t dance to the government’s tune.”Workers at Nihon Kikai, a subsidiary of underwear maker Katakura Industries 3001.T, seem to share that view.In a survey published by the company union in January, more than 40 percent of members said they were very unhappy with their living standards, up from 35 percent the previous year.Like many Japanese firm, Nihon Kikai cut wages in response to the 2008/09 financial crisis. While that was partly restored last year, the union says it has not compensated for rising household bills.The company declined to comment about wage negotiations when asked whether the it planned to award higher pay increases in accordance with Abe’s call for wage hikes.Salaries in Japan have been rising in nominal terms, but not fast enough to keep pace with prices inflated by Abe’s easy money policies and a sales tax increase in April.Real wages slid 2.5 percent in 2014, down for a third straight year. The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (JTUC) this year is asking for pay increases in excess of 2 percent.The extra-loose monetary policy that is a key pillar of Abenomics has benefited an elite of big exporters such as Toyota. But many smaller firms are being squeezed as the weaker yen raises the cost of imported parts.In the third quarter of 2014, large firms had operating margins of 5.9 percent, compared with 2.8 percent at small firms, according to a survey by Japan’s Ministry of Finance.“Suppliers are under constant pressure to cut prices,�� said Tetsuya Gomi, a senior official at the Japanese Association of Metal Machinery and Manufacturing Workers, an umbrella organization that represents 350,000 small company workers.“Even if small firms are making money they can’t award workers bigger pay rises than the parent company.��($1 = 118.9500 yen)	4.203216374
TOKYO/DETROIT (Reuters) - When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets on Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump, Japan’s bulging automotive trade surplus will be a sore spot, but the path to balancing auto exports and imports will be no easier than it was in the 1980s.Trump may press Abe to do more to level the trade imbalance with Japan during a White House visit or a round of golf, but the two leaders are unlikely to change the fact that the big cars and trucks that America makes do not sell in Japan.Many Japanese consumers, faced with congested cities, favor tiny domestically-made vehicles, called kei cars, which make up more than a third of the market. Priced from around 1.1 million yen, or about $9,800, these cars have engines most Americans would consider inadequate for a motorcycle.Even Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co cannot convince Japanese consumers to buy models that are popular in the United States. Small sport utility vehicles such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda’s CR-V are seen by Japanese consumers as too big.Only about 13,000 vehicles from U.S. automakers sold in Japan in both 2016 and 2015, and of that about three-fourths were Jeep SUVs made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Ford Motor Co announced last month that it is pulling out of the Japanese market entirely, after selling just 2,400 vehicles there in 2016.The Japanese auto market has shrunk not only in terms of vehicle size, but in sales volume. As a result, global automakers, including Japan’s, are focused on boosting sales in China, the United States and growing emerging markets.“It would take a painstaking fine-tuning of vehicle specs to suit American cars to those driving and other conditions and develop a strong distribution network to be able to gain traction in Japan. It is nothing short of a 20-year effort,�� said a Toyota executive who spoke on condition he not be named.Jaguar Land Rover Japan Ltd Chief Executive Magnus Hansson said the low sales of U.S. cars in Japan did not mean it was a closed market, but rather reflected “a total and absolute lack of effort over 50 years�� by Detroit.Still, Japan remains an export hub for the big Japanese automakers. The U.S. Commerce Department this week reported that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 2016 was $68.9 billion, and of that total surplus, some $52.6 billion was in vehicles and automotive parts.Japan’s automakers have more than 90 percent of the Japanese market. Last year U.S. automakers controlled only 45 percent of their home market, the world’s second-biggest after China.A bigger factor than imports in the Detroit automakers�� loss of U.S. market share since 1980 is the surge in investment by Japan’s automakers in U.S. factories. Last year, 56 percent of the vehicles Toyota sold in the United States were made in America, the company said. Toyota said it employs more than 34,000 in the United States.For years the growth of Japanese-owned auto factories in the U.S. heartland has helped cool trade tensions.But Trump, a Republican, has turned up the heat by complaining about the trade surplus and accusing Japan of manipulating the value of the yen to disadvantage American-made goods.On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators from auto manufacturing states called on the new president “to address currency manipulation and auto-related non-tariff barriers.”They are not alone in urging changes to help bolster U.S. business.��(Trump) must bring Abe up short on any cheery notion that business will continue as usual,�� said Kevin L. Kearns, head of the U.S. Business and Industry Council.The group represents smaller U.S. manufacturers, many of which feed the U.S. auto industry.(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu, Norihiko Shirouzu and Bernie Woodall; Editing by Joseph White and Tom Brown)	-0.6396214843
TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has started using batteries that Panasonic Corp designed for Tesla Inc in some of its plug-in hybrids sold in China, the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday.Toyota is using Panasonic’s cylindrical batteries in its new Corolla and Levin plug-in hybrid sedans launched in China this year, the Nikkei said, without citing sources. Toyota is believed to have ordered about 50,000 of the batteries, the paper said.A Panasonic spokeswoman said the company was not in a position to comment as a supplier, while Toyota declined to comment.

TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, the maker of Subaru cars, plans to invest $400 million to expand production capacity at its sole U.S. plant in Indiana by around 100,000 vehicles, the Japanese automaker said on Wednesday.The company, which exports nearly 70 percent of its Japan-made production, wants to make more vehicles in its biggest market, the United States, to limit the impact of currency moves.Along with the expansion, which will utilize an existing line, Fuji Heavy is set to hire about 900 employees at the Subaru of Indiana factory, CEO Yasuyuki Yoshinaga told reporters.“We continue to see strong sales in the United States, and we were seeing a situation in which there was a lack of car supply,�� Yoshinaga said. “We think this will contribute to the regional economy of Indiana.”The plant will start to produce the Impreza compact car using the added capacity, he said, the first time the Impreza will be produced outside of Japan.The carmaker currently produces Outback, Legacy and Tribeca at its plant in Indiana, as well as Toyota Motor Corp’s Camry. Toyota owns 16.47 percent of Fuji Heavy shares.The plant currently has an annual capacity of 270,000 vehicles, of which 100,000 is devoted to the Camry. The capacity for Toyota’s Camry will stay at 100,000 vehicles, Yoshinaga said.The $400 million investment will boost total capacity to 400,000 vehicles by end-2016.Fuji Heavy, Japan’s smallest carmaker by volume, booked on Wednesday a record annual operating profit of 120.4 billion yen ($1.22 billion) for the financial year ended March, more than double the 44 billion yen it booked in the previous year, on strong sales in the United States, aided by the yen’s depreciation versus the dollar.	2.547824615
"TORONTO (Reuters) - Workers at Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Canadian plants are set to vote next week on whether to become the first at wholly owned Toyota facilities in North America to unionize, a push Canada's biggest private-sector union is confident will succeed.A “yes�� vote would mark a major victory for the union, Unifor, which has more than 300,000 members, including more than 39,000 in the auto industry, even though previous attempts to organize Toyota’s Canadian plants failed.“There’s no question, there will be a lot of eyes on this drive,�� Unifor President Jerry Dias said at a press conference on Monday, where he was flanked by Toyota employees who said they wanted a bigger say in their workplace.Unifor, which filed for union certification at Toyota with the Ontario labor board on Monday, said it did not want to say exactly how many workers have signed union cards, citing strategy. It said, however, that of the 6,500 workers at the three Toyota assembly plants in Ontario, well over the 40 percent needed for a vote to be held have signed cards.The results of the vote, which is expected to start on Monday, will not be known until later in April, the union said. More than 50 percent of workers would have to vote “yes�� for a union to be formed.Toyota Motor Co of Canada, which has two plants in Cambridge, Ontario, and one plant in Woodstock, Ontario, said that its workers already “have a package that’s at, or near, the top of the industry�� and that it was uncertain what more a union could offer.“We don’t know what they’re going to be able to negotiate or, frankly, what they’re going negotiate away,�� said spokesman Greig Mordue. “What Unifor can offer is, frankly, a mystery.”He added that Toyota Canada, which began assembling vehicles in Ontario in 1988, has never laid off a permanent employee.Mordue said that that record stands despite such challenges as the recession, and a 50 percent drop in production for two months earlier this year due to supply chain disruptions.If a union is formed, collective bargaining would begin immediately, Dias said, and would address such key issues as wages, pensions, contract work, and health and safety standards.Negotiations would create a Toyota-specific contract, he added, and not be a ""carbon copy"" of what was negotiated with the Detroit 3 in Canada in 2012. Unifor represents workers at the Canadian arms of General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FIA.MI.“The auto industry in Canada, and Ontario specifically, is a C$69 billion ($62.51 billion) a year industry and we want to protect it,�� Dias said. That means the union would not negotiate a contract at Toyota with labor costs that were out of line with other manufacturers, he added.Toyota workers are unhappy with temporary contracts, Unifor has said, which have reduced benefits and don’t allow participation in the company’s pension plan. About one-quarter of Toyota’s 6,500 workers are contract workers, Dias said.The pension plan is also an issue after the company said last year that it would put new permanent hires on a defined contribution plan, versus a more costly defined benefit plan.Unifor said part of its confidence in the Toyota campaign is a reflection of the movement’s home-grown roots. The first union cards from Toyota in 2012 were photocopies that workers had made on the back of company bulletins, Unifor said.The drive gathered speed with last September’s high-publicity formation of Unifor, a merger of the Canadian Auto Workers union and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers union, Unifor said.At its two plants in Cambridge, the company manufactures the Toyota Corolla, Toyota Matrix and Lexus RSX 350. The Toyota Rav4 is made at a newer plant in Woodstock.Toyota, which says its staffing is significantly higher than the 6,500 estimated by Unifor, can assemble more than 500,000 vehicles annually at its Canadian plants.In 2008, the International Association of Machinists withdrew a bid to try to unionize the Canadian Toyota plants due to inadequate support. That followed a similar withdrawal by the Canadian Auto Workers in 2001.Unifor’s push comes after the high-profile failure of the United Auto Workers to unionize workers at a Chattanooga, Tennessee, Volkswagen plant.Currently, the UAW represents just one foreign-owned U.S. factory, a Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, with around 1,000 workers. Overall UAW membership increased in 2013, however.Unifor said that 90 percent of Toyota plants worldwide are unionized. Toyota previously had a joint-venture auto manufacturing plant in California with GM that was unionized, but it shut in 2010. The plant is now owned by Tesla Motors Inc TSLA.O.($1=$1.10 Canadian)"	-3.082494259
* Rules aimed at reducing imports, increasing local production* New rules to have greater impact on premium car makers -sources* Companies fear impact on sales, supply chain disruption -sourcesNEW DELHI, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Foreign automakers are seeking delays and exemptions to India’s planned new quality rules for imported auto parts, arguing the regulations will increase costs, hurt sales and disrupt supply chains, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to reduce imports to boost local manufacturing to make India more self-sufficient and enable it to play a bigger role in the global supply chain. That said, the move is seen mainly aimed at slashing the amount of lower-quality imports from China.“There is short term pain but there is long term gain,�� Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told an auto convention last week, saying India has become a dumping ground for low-quality goods by not having standards similar to other countries.New rules mandating stricter quality checks have been flagged in stages for various auto parts since early this year and tighter regulations for wheel rims could be introduced as soon as October, according to a draft government notice.All automakers will have to comply, but foreign premium brands such as Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi will suffer most as they have the highest ratio of imported parts, four auto executives told Reuters.“It’s just an additional compliance burden and will not lead to higher local production because the volumes for luxury are too small to achieve economies of scale,�� said one of the executives.The sources declined to be identified, citing sensitive negotiations with the government.Luxury carmakers account for less than 1% of India’s annual passenger car sales in terms of volume although they contribute roughly 10% in terms of revenue.Executives from premium German brands as well as Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp have held several rounds of talks with government officials in recent weeks, sources said.Martin Schwenk, head of Mercedes-Benz India, said in a statement to Reuters that additional requirements “will make low volume business unviable��. His company is requesting a “reasonable time line for mid to long term implementation, and exemptions for low volume manufacturers in the short-term.”Volkswagen Group’s India unit also said in a statement that for premium vehicles it was not possible to localise a “majority of components or spares as the total size of market is marginal.”Other automakers named in this article did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.Automakers are also lobbying through the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) which sources say is seeking up to a year to comply with the rules for higher volume vehicles where parts can be sourced locally.The industry body is also seeking exemptions for low volume cars such as luxury models and for parts which automakers directly import as opposed to parts imported by trading companies and by vendors in the after-sales market, the sources said.Mercedes�� Schwenk said the company had addressed its concerns through SIAM to relevant authorities and was “hopeful of a positive outcome��.In addition to those lobbying efforts, Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW also held a meeting with the German ambassador in New Delhi in July to apprise him of the issue, sources said.The draft government notice for wheel rims calls for new rules to go into effect from Oct. 1 and includes a requirement that there be an audit of the plant where the rims are made. That would be difficult with current travel restrictions in place due to the coronavirus pandemic, sources said.It was not clear when the draft notice might be finalised.To receive a shipment of imported cars or knocked-down car kits an order needs to be placed with global headquarters at least four months in advance, executives at two automakers said.“If there is no clarity, the headquarters will not take new orders and sales will suffer,�� said one of the executives.From April 1, 2021 similar rules will apply to windshields and other safety glass. In June, India also made it mandatory for companies to get a licence to import certain types of tyres.“This is against every tenet of ease of doing business,�� said a senior auto executive, noting the new rules come at a time when the pandemic has hit revenue and demand, and could discourage further investment in India.“Much more than the cost it is the complexity which affects the willingness of global companies to continue selling affected car models in India,�� the executive said.

* Audi defend Le Mans title* First win for a hybrid car* Injured Davidson to stay in hospital until Wednesday (Adds quotes, Davidson injury update)LE MANS, France, June 17 (Reuters) - Audi defended their Le Mans 24 Hours endurance title on Sunday with Germany’s Andre Lotterer taking the chequered flag for the second year in a row in a first victory for a hybrid car.The dominant German manufacturer swept the podium in their 11th win in the last 13 years at the Sarthe circuit. They won last year with a diesel engine.“It’s really superb as when you come here for the first time you don’t know how the technology will work out,�� Audi motorsport head Wolfgang Ullrich told reporters after the 80th edition of the race.The number one diesel-hybrid R18 - shared by Lotterer, France’s Benoit Treluyer and Switzerland’s Marcel Faessler - led for most of the race and denied Denmark’s Tom Kristensen a ninth win in the number two Audi.“We arrived better prepared and as we won last year it gave us confidence,�� said Treluyer. “We kept the same driver line-up and to be on the hybrid project motivated us even more.”Germany’s Mike Rockenfeller, a winner for Audi in 2010, wrapped up the 1-2-3 when he crossed the line in third place in a non-hybrid car.Audi overcame a scare with three hours to go when British driver Allan McNish slid the number two Audi into the barriers at the Porsche Curves only moments after Spaniard Marc Gene plunged his non-hybrid Audi into the tyres at the first chicane.McNish’s car was quickly back on track, with the Scot handing over to Kristensen, but Gene’s number three car lost 20 minutes and finished in fifth place with Frenchman Loic Duval at the wheel.Frenchman Nicolas Prost, son of four-times Formula One champion Alain, split the Audis by claiming fourth place for Rebellion Racing’s Toyota-powered Lola B12.Scotland’s Peter Dumbreck and former Formula One drivers David Brabham and Karun Chandhok, the first Indian to race at Le Mans, finished a strong sixth in the JRM team’s HPD ARX 03a.Toyota saw their challenge fade overnight.They had snatched the lead after five hours of intense racing but their excitement turned to horror when Anthony Davidson suffered a spectacular crash.The Briton’s Toyota tagged a Ferrari and took off, twisting 360 degrees in the air before plunging into the tyre barriers at Mulsanne Corner.Davidson, who clambered out of the car before gesticulating for help from the medical team, will stay in hospital until Wednesday after fracturing two vertebrae in the incident.“Well that was a big one! Feeling a bit sore today, but generally happy to be alive,�� the 33-year-old, whose injuries could take three months to heal fully, said on Twitter.Toyota later retired their other car when the engine failed.“It was a real disappointment to end the race early; our dream was to see the chequered flag,�� said Kazuki Nakajima, who was the last Toyota driver out on track.Despite failing to finish, Toyota impressed after returning to sportscar racing for the first time in 13 years with a petrol-electric hybrid car.Before his exit, Nakajima ended the run of the experimental Nissan DeltaWing overnight when the Toyota pushed it off the road and into the barriers at the exit of the Porsche Curves.The sleek car, reminiscent of a ‘Batmobile��, had been invited to race at Le Mans to showcase new technologies, including a smaller engine and four-inch front wheels.“It hurt last night and it hasn’t got any easier,�� said Marino Franchitti, younger brother of Indy 500 winner Dario and a cousin of Formula One racer Paul di Resta.“But I’m very proud to show that this car works and what the future of motorsport could be. I hope this is only the beginning of this car.”Ex-Formula One driver and 1990 Le Mans winner Martin Brundle paired up with son Alex for the first time and Spanish gamer-turned-racer Lucas Ordonez in a Zytek and finished 15th.

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - One Bridgestone Corp executive and two former officials from the company were indicted Tuesday for conspiring to fix the prices of certain automotive parts, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.Bridgestone itself agreed in February to plead guilty to price-fixing and agreed to pay a $425 million criminal fine. The case involves anti-vibration parts used in automotive suspension systems and engine mounts.Yoshiyuki Tanaka, Yasuo Ryuto and Isao Yoshida, all Japanese nationals, were indicted on Monday in a court in Ohio for allegedly fixing the prices of parts sold to Toyota Motor Corp , Nissan Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd, which makes Subaru cars, the department said.Tanaka works for Bridgestone while Ryuto and Yoshida are no longer with the company, the department said. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to 10 years in prison, it said.Including Bridgestone, 26 companies have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in the department’s long-running investigation of price-fixing in the auto parts industry. Thirty-two people have been charged.The case is at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and is the United States of America v. Yasuo Ryuto, Yoshiyuki Tanaka and Isao Yoshida. It is case No. 14-138. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)	1.050981838

TOKYO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies plans to launch its first taxi-hailing pilot service in Japan that will connect passengers to other taxi providers, as it seeks to expand in the country where the U.S. firm has been blocked from setting up its own fleet of drivers.In the coming months, Uber plans to provide its ride-hailing app to residents and visitors to Awaji, an island with a population of around 150,000 located near Osaka, to request taxis operated by more than 20 local taxi companies.The pilot will run through March 2019.“Currently we are concentrating on partnerships with taxi companies in the country,�� Uber Japan spokeswoman Kay Hattori said on Tuesday. “We would like to expand this nationwide.”Uber has been unable to bring its full ride-hailing services to Japan as local regulations outlaw non-professional drivers from transporting paying customers, but it already operates its UberEats takeaway delivery service in four Japanese cities, including Tokyo and Osaka.Its mobile app can be used in Tokyo to connect users with car services, while Uber is also conducting two ride-hailing pilot services for elderly people in rural towns in Japan as the country’s aging population makes it an attractive prospect for ride-hailing companies.Earlier this year, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told investors that Uber must change the way it does business in Japan, adding that it would focus on partnerships with taxi companies.Amid the global rise of ride-hailing services and other next-generation taxi services, a growing number of companies are jockeying for a share of Japan’s $16 billion taxi industry.China’s Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Group Corp have announced they will roll out a venture in Japan to provide ride-hailing services. Toyota and Sony Corp have separately partnered with local taxi firms to develop services that use artificial intelligence to predict usage and demand.	-2.840614107
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto parts supplier Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc is not interested in buying Turkey’s Teklas Kaucuk, which supplies such carmakers as General Motors and BMW, Cooper-Standard’s top executive said on Wednesday.Cooper-Standard, based outside Detroit, is not interested in expanding in Europe given that region’s uncertainties at the moment, Chairman and Chief executive Jeffrey Edwards told Reuters.“It’s not surprising that people would mention our name,�� he said at the company’s headquarters in Novi, Michigan. “In this case, it wasn’t true.“We aren’t interested in really spending a lot of cash in Europe,�� Edwards added. “We’re trying to get right-sized there. We’re trying to make sure that we can survive in Europe as a smaller, more profitable company.”Sources previously told Reuters that Teklas put itself up for sale in a deal that could value the family-owned maker of rubber hoses and metal tubes for use in air conditioning, brakes and electric vehicles at as much as 700 million euros. ($779.17 million)The sources identified Cooper-Standard as a suitor that was being targeted as a potential buyer of Teklas, which also supplies parts to Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Volkswagen.Edwards said Cooper-Standard will be more opportunistic as it related to acquisitions, but prices have not been attractive in the last few years.The main businesses for Cooper-Standard, with about $3.5 billion in annual sales, are sealing systems, fuel and brake delivery systems, and fluid transfer systems.	5.043841336
(Reuters) - A Texas jury awarded damages of $242 million to a Dallas family after finding that defects in the family’s Lexus sedan caused injuries to their two children during a rear-end collision, the law firm representing the plaintiffs said on Friday.The verdict by the jury in Dallas County District Court includes more than $143.6 million in punitive damages after jurors agreed that the actions of Lexus-maker Toyota Motor Corp and Toyota Motor Sales amounted to gross negligence, the Law Offices of Frank L. Branson said in a statement.The collision involving the family’s 2002 Lexus ES 300 sedan occurred in September 2016. The 3-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter of Benjamin and Kristi Reavis were in the car’s back seat, in child safety seats, the statement said.The jury found that the sedan’s front seats “were unreasonably dangerous and the defendants failed to warn about those dangers,�� the statement said.“The automaker made a conscious decision to protect front-seat occupants from crash injuries like whiplash at the expense of rear-seat passengers,�� attorney Frank Branson said in the statement.Toyota said it would consider its options going forward.“While we respect the jury’s decision, we remain confident that the injuries sustained were the result of factors specific to this very severe collision, not a defect in the design or manufacturing of the 2002 Lexus ES300,�� a Toyota spokesman said in an emailed statement.	-0.6408696358
SEOUL (Reuters) - Sales of Japanese-branded autos in South Korea slumped in July amid a worsening diplomatic row between the two countries that has led to consumer boycotts and efforts by Seoul to cut the economy’s reliance on imports from Japan.Toyota Motor's 7203.T sales in South Korea tumbled 32% from a year earlier while Honda's 7267.T sales skidded 34%, industry data out of South Korea showed on Monday. Although automakers are still assessing the main factors driving the declines last month, industry participants and analysts expect an intensifying boycott campaign to hurt demand further, as diplomatic tensions grow.Japan tightened controls in July on exports to South Korea, escalating a row over wartime forced laborers and sparking a boycott by South Korean consumers of Japanese products and services, from cars, beer and pens to tours.On Friday, Japan escalated tensions by removing South Korea from a list of export destinations approved for fast-track status.“Showroom visits are declining while consumers are holding off on signing contracts,�� a Honda Korea official told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.South Korean representatives for Honda and Toyota did not provide any commentary on the sales trends and said they would need to assess the reasons for the decline.However, industry watchers said public sentiment was a factor behind the sharp falls.“The South Korean public is angry about Japan...It will soon become a taboo to drive Japanese cars in Korea,�� said Kim Pil-soo, an automotive engineering professor at Daelim University College.The data from the Korea Automobile Importers &amp; Distributors Association (KAIDA) also showed sales by Lexus, Toyota’s luxury badge and the third-most imported brand into South Korea after Mercedes and BMW, down 25% from the previous month, although they were still up 33% from the previous year.Japanese officials have cited unspecified security reasons for the export curbs to South Korea.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Armed with fact sheets on jobs created and investments made in America, Japan aims to give Donald Trump a crash course on its contribution to the U.S. economy in hopes of persuading him that Tokyo is different from Trump’s favorite trade target, China.Tokyo wants Trump, who will become president next week, to see the merits of global trade, rethink his threats to impose a “border tax�� on imports, and to stick to international trade deals on which Japan Inc bases its investment strategies.And while Japan’s economy still relies heavily on exports for growth, its officials also want to alter any lingering image Trump may have formed based on trade wars fought with the United States decades ago.“Japan is preparing so that soon after the change in administration, we can ... explain our points in a format persuasive to the American side,�� Masahiko Shibayama, an advisor to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, told Reuters.“Japan is a country that lives by diplomacy and trade.”To make their case with hard numbers, Japan’s government has prepared a briefing paper its officials are using in talks with U.S. counterparts. The document, seen by Reuters, has not been released, and sources would not say if it had been shown to Trump or senior members of his team.Highlights included:- 839,000 jobs created by Japanese companies jobs in the United States, second only to Britain and above the 38,000 employed by Chinese businesses.- Cumulative Japanese investment of $411 billion, dwarfing China’s $15 billion.- Japan’s shrinking share of the U.S. trade deficit to 9 percent from more than half in the early 1990s versus China’s opposite trend.Trump last week added Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to the list of multinational corporations he's threatened with a ""big border tax"" if they expand factories abroad to export into the United States. Trump repeated that threat on Wednesday in his first news conference since winning the Nov. 8 election.He also lumped Japan with China and Mexico as big contributors to America’s trade deficit -- a perception that Japanese officials are desperate to correct.“We need to start pointing out very clearly the difference with China,�� a senior Japanese diplomat with trade negotiating experience told Reuters.Officials in Tokyo also stressed that what Trump says before taking office next Friday and what he does after that may be different.They also hope some members of his economic team, such as his choice for commerce secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who has done business in Japan, will temper his harsher views on trade.Tokyo is keen to erase any lingering legacy of U.S.-Japan trade wars fought in autos, steel and semiconductors in the 1980s and early 1990s.Trump’s pick for U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, was deputy U.S. trade representative under Ronald Reagan and took part in some of those trade disputes.Japanese companies, like other multinationals, are also getting into the public relations act. nL1N1EZ1CPToyota’s North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz said on Monday that Toyota would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, but said the decision was not a response to Trump’s criticism of the automaker’s plans to shift some production to Mexico from Canada.Japanese officials hope lobbying members of U.S. Congress and other politicians in regions where Japanese firms employ large numbers of Americans will help temper Trump’s policies.On Tuesday, Toyota President Akio Toyoda met U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana, a state where - according to the fact sheet - Japanese firms employed 47,400 people as of 2014.Still, some fear the Trump administration will have to learn the hard way by seeing the damage done to the U.S. economy from disruptions to a global supply chain.“It may take time for them to learn the lesson and it may have to be learned the hard way,�� the senior diplomat said."	-4.740839663
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T cut its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday as the Japanese company expects weaker vehicle sales in emerging Asian countries, where demand for cars has been hit by slowing growth.Slowing sales may knock Toyota from its perch as the world's biggest selling automaker, a title it has held for the past few months after unseating Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in an ongoing, closely contested race.Hit by a slump in sales in Indonesia and Thailand during the July-September quarter, Toyota lowered its revenue forecast by 1 percent to 27.5 trillion yen ($225.82 billion), citing an uncertain economic outlook in emerging Asian countries.Like many Japanese automakers, Toyota has been enjoying solid growth in the United States, which is on track for a record year of annual sales due to an improving economy and lower gasoline prices.But it is a different story in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other emerging regions, where Toyota has a bigger presence than other car makers, analysts said.“Toyota is more regionally diversified than most Japanese automakers, and the regions where it has a bigger presence than its competitors, particularly in emerging countries, are the ones whose economies are slowing down the most,�� said Takaki Nakanishi, director at auto industry researcher Nakanishi Research Institute.The automaker said that while it expects to hit its annual China target of 1.1 million units, profitability in the world’s largest auto market is likely to worsen due a slowing economy.“The auto market especially in developed economies will remain strong, but Asia may not recover as much as we are hoping to see, so we are more cautious on our emerging market forecast,�� Managing Officer Tetsuya Otake told reporters.Still, Toyota expects revenue including sales and other sources of income to be 1 percent higher than last year, and it kept its operating profit forecast unchanged at 2.8 trillion yen, as the effects of a weaker yen and cost reduction efforts would offset easing volumes and rising marketing-related expenses.Toyota has topped the leader board for global auto sales in the past few months, selling 7.49 million cars worldwide in the year to September, more than No. 2 Volkswagen AG’s 7.43 million during the same period.Operating profit rose 26 percent to 827.4 billion yen ($6.81 billion), just ahead of a consensus estimate, while net profit for the quarter rose 13.5 percent to 611.72 billion yen.Ongoing yen weakness is continuing to bolster profits at Japanese automakers, with Toyota expecting a sluggish domestic currency to add 65.0 billion yen to its bottom line for the year ending March 2016.On Thursday, it raised its full-year dollar/yen assumption rate to 118 yen from a previous forecast of 117 yen. This compares with the yen's current trading price around 122 yen JPY=.Yen weakness and strong U.S. sales are also benefiting Japan's smaller automakers, with both Fuji Heavy Industries 7270.T, which produces the Subaru brand, and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T both raising their full-year forecasts for sales and profits on Thursday.Toyota said it would continue to investigate Takaka Corp's 7312.T air bag inflators and remained committed to using ""higher quality"" components, but did not elaborate its position on whether it would keep using air bag inflators made the parts supplier at the center of a global recall crisis.($1 = 121.7800 yen)"	1.81418809

That topped the previous highest sales year of 2002.Truck sales jumped 6.9 percent while passenger car sales were almost flat for the year, with the discrepancy even wider in December with truck sales up 14.4 percent and car sales shrinking by 9.7 percent.Ford Motor Co’s Canadian arm sold fewer vehicles in December than a year earlier but held its position as the country’s best-selling automaker in 2013 as truck sales helped it notch overall growth of 2.7 percent, the company said.Chrysler claimed second place, with a 4.7 percent jump in December sales and 6.6 percent growth for the year, helped by record sales of its Ram trucks.“Overall 2013 goes down as the year of the truck,�� DesRosiers wrote. “The F150 alone outsells other full-line nameplates including Kia, Mazda and Nissan.”General Motors Co meanwhile posted the biggest gain in December sales, up 17 percent, while taking third place for the year on 4 percent growth. Its Cadillac brand notched 44.6 percent annual sales gains for its best-ever Canadian sales.Toyota Motor Corp said its luxury Lexus brand had a marquee year that helped the company notch 1.7 percent annual growth and cemented its fourth-place position.Other luxury brands including Land Rover, Porsche and Jaguar recorded double-digit annual growth.Ford said it was their best year for Canadian sales since 1997, with the F-Series pickup truck leading all vehicle sales for the fourth straight year. The company’s Fusion and Escape models also recorded their best-ever sales.Honda Motor Co Ltd said its Civic was Canada’s top-selling car for the 16th straight year. Honda’s monthly sales nudged slightly higher overall to 13,316, but grew 10.4 percent for the year to 164,236.Ford’s total vehicle sales in December slipped 4.2 percent to 16,161, as it sold fewer cars than a year ago. For the year, it sold 283,588 vehicles, an increase of 2.7 percent.Chrysler, which is owned by Italy’s Fiat SpA, sold 15,445 vehicles in December and 260,015 in all of 2013, while GM sold 17,036 vehicles in December and 234,944 in the year. Toyota sold 12,348 vehicles in December and 195,360 in 2013.Ford said in September that it would invest C$700 million ($659 million) in its Oakville assembly plant as North American demand surged to pre-recession levels.December sales in the much larger U.S. market came up short of expectations, but 2014 sales are forecast to keep outpacing the overall U.S. economy recovery from recession.

BEIJING, June 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners sold 81,100 automobiles in China in May, up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, the automaker said on Tuesday.That followed a 12.4 percent year-on-year rise in April and a 19 percent rise in March.Sources with direct knowledge of the data told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that Toyota’s China sales growth slowed to 3 percent in May, mainly because sales of the Corolla model in China fell sharply ahead of the planned launch of a redesigned version of the model this summer.In the first five months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker sold 394,900 vehicles, up 16.1 percent from a year earlier.Toyota this year aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China. If accomplished, this would see the carmaker surpass annual sales of 1 million vehicles in China for the first time, a target it originally aimed for in 2010.Toyota’s executive vice president Yasumori Ihara said in Beijing in April that over the longer-term the Japanese automaker aims to double sales in China to about 2 million vehicles a year but gave no time frame for the objective.Last year, Toyota sold 917,500 vehicles in China.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group.

TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Takata Corp is considering booking a quarterly charge of 2-3 billion yen ($19-$28 million) to cover the cost of additional recalls of vehicles fitted with potentially defective airbags, two people familiar with the matter said.The additional charge - on top of 75 billion yen previously set aside for airbag recalls - would cover the projected cost of recent recalls announced by Nissan Motor, Honda Motor and Toyota Motor, said the people with knowledge of Takata’s financial projections, who didn’t want to be named as they are not authorized to speak for the company.The charge would likely be booked in Takata’s results for the first half of the current fiscal year ending March 2015, they said. Takata is due to report quarterly results on Nov. 6.The additional charge would represent a partial reckoning for a global auto safety recall that began in 2008 and has included more than 16 million vehicles. Specifically, the charge would represent the projected cost to Takata in response to recalls of a total of about 570,000 vehicles announced recently to fix defective airbags.Last week, Nissan said it was recalling 260,000 vehicles globally due to defective airbags, while Toyota has also said this month it was recalling 247,000 cars to fix Takata airbags. Honda on Aug. 26 said it was recalling about 63,200 vehicles.Takata previously announced a charge of around 45 billion yen in the April-June quarter to deal with airbag recalls. In the year to March 2013, Takata took a 30 billion yen charge and posted a record 21.1 billion yen net loss after carmakers recalled 4 million vehicles for defects in its air bags that leave them at risk of exploding with dangerous force in an accident.Takata said in July it was studying the impact of the 45 billion yen special loss on its full-year forecast.U.S. safety regulators are investigating whether Takata airbag inflators made in 2000-07 were improperly sealed or subject to another defect.Airbags inflating with too much force have the potential to spray metal shrapnel at car occupants. Defective Takata airbags have been linked to four deaths in the United States, and dozens of injury claims. The probe by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has focused on inflators recovered from cars being recalled for repairs in hot and humid places like Florida.Takata is cooperating with that investigation along with 10 automakers.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers posted September U.S. sales on Monday that were slightly lower than a year ago, despite big consumer discounts, as pickup truck volumes fell for both General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N.Research firm Autodata Corp showed total industry sales at 1.44 million vehicles, down 0.5 percent for a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.76 million from 18.05 million in September 2015.GM, the top-seller in the United States, posted a 0.6 percent decline. Ford reported an 8 percent drop, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU.NFCHA.MI was down 1 percent. Shares of the three Detroit automakers rose, led by GM with a 0.8 percent gain.Sales of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T grew 1.5 percent; Honda Motor Co 7267.T had a decline of 0.1 percent; and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T showed a 5 percent rise.Mark Wakefield, head of North American automotive practice at consultancy AlixPartners, said in a telephone interview that demand for pickup trucks remained strong in part because of low gasoline prices, despite the September dip for the biggest sellers. He also noted that September 2015 sales had been extremely strong, at an annualized rate of 18 million vehicles.Wakefield said the market has shifted to one of “push�� from manufacturers rather than “pull�� from consumers, with discounts of just over 10 percent of the average selling price of new vehicles for the last several months.While Ford said that September was the best month in 2016 for its F-Series pickup truck, sales were still down 3 percent from a year earlier.GM said pickup sales fell 15.5 percent for its Chevrolet Silverado and 8.5 percent for its GMC Sierra.Spokesman Dan Flores said in a telephone call that GM was holding tight reins on discounts, also called incentives, for Silverado and Sierra. It has 89 days of supply for those trucks, which he said put it in a good position heading into the fourth quarter, historically the strongest for pickups.Fiat Chrysler’s Ram 1500 pickup truck showed a sales increase of 29 percent.Fiat Chrysler spokesman Ralph Kisiel, responding by email to a Reuters query about rivals�� claims that Ram pickup trucks were highly discounted, said the company has offered “good deals�� on 2016 model trucks to make way for the new 2017 models.Most analysts forecast a decrease in 2016 from last year’s record sales of nearly 17.5 million vehicles.The fourth quarter of 2015 was strong, so the next several months will present difficult comparisons, Wakefield said.Industrywide spending for discounts rose $430 per vehicle from a year ago, Mark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said on a conference call after the company reported sales.J.D. Power, in a research note last week, estimated record September industry incentive spending.In contrast to most analysts�� expectations, Toyota and GM executives said on Monday that a new record this year was within reach.“Industry sales in 2016 remain in line with last year’s record levels,�� said Bill Fay, head of the Toyota brand in the U.S. market, told reporters on a conference call.GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a telephone interview on Monday, “I don’t see any downturn in the U.S. economy any time soon.��	-1.8728865
MILAN (Reuters) - AS Roma is in talks with a group led by U.S. billionaire Dan Friedkin looking to buy the Italian Serie A soccer club, it said on MondayEurope’s top soccer clubs have attracted big money from some of the world’s richest investors over the past decade as the game draws more fans and television revenue in lucrative markets such as Asia, the United States and the Middle East.The proposed deal is the latest soccer foray by a U.S. investor after Manchester City’s Abu Dhabi-controlled owner in November sold a $500 million stake in the English club to U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake.In June American billionaire Rocco Commisso bought Serie A club ACF Fiorentina from Italy’s Della Valle family for a reported sum of about 160 million euros.Press reports said Friedkin would pay between 750 million and 790 million euros ($840 million to $884 million), including debt, for an 82% stake in AS Roma.The club made a loss of 24 million euros on revenue of 233 million euros in the financial year to June 30. Net debt amounted to 221 million euros.Shares in AS Roma shot up more than 9% at the open in Milan on Monday but pared gains to stand 4.4% up at 1226 GMT.“Any deal with Group Friedkin is subject to the positive outcome of the legal due diligence process on the AS Roma group,�� the club said in a statement.AS Roma last changed hands in 2012 when it was taken over by a group of U.S. investors led by James Pallotta, who became the club’s president.Pallotta, a U.S. businessman of Italian descent, failed to revive the fortunes of the club, which won the last of its three Serie A titles in 2001.AS Roma idol Francesco Totti, a former captain of the club who won the World Cup with Italy in 2006, left as technical director in June, complaining he had never been given a proper role during his two years on the management team and had been excluded from key decisions.He said he would be ready to return to the club if Pallotta left.Having missed out on UEFA Champions League qualification after finishing sixth in Serie A last season, when Juventus won their eighth consecutive title, AS Roma are in the second-tier Europa League. They have reached the knockout stages and next play Belgian side KAA Gent for a place in the last 16.AS Roma’s current owners have been trying to sell the club for a while, holding talks with various potential buyers amid growing frustration with local authorities over a stalled project to build a new stadium.Friedkin is chairman and CEO of the eponymous group with assets ranging from luxury resorts to one of the world’s largest independent Toyota distributors, serving 150 dealerships in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.Reuters was unable to reach the Friedkin group for immediate comment.For a FACTBOX on ownership of European soccer clubs, click on($1 = 0.8939 euros)	0.384232247
TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - Four Japanese carmakers, including top ranked Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan , are working together to increase the number of electric vehicle chargers around the country in a bid to boost car sales, the companies said on Monday.Electric-powered vehicles accounted for just 0.6 percent of total vehicle sales in Japan in 2012, but the government wants to increase that figure to between 15 and 20 percent by 2020.Toyota, Japan’s biggest carmaker, and rivals Nissan Motor Co , Honda Motor Co and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said they want to increase the number of chargers by 12,000 from just under 5,000 now.The government has set aside 100.5 billion yen ($1.02 billion) to increase the number of electric car chargers. The carmakers said they would pay for the costs not covered by the subsidy programme, but declined to specify the amount.Toyota makes the Prius plug-in hybrid and Nissan manufactures the Leaf, currently the world’s best selling electric vehicle.Honda builds the Accord plug-in and Mitsubishi makes the i-MiEV electric vehicle and the Outlander SUV plug-in.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp's 7269.T position in India and other markets is under serious threat from Toyota's 7203.T buyout of rival Daihatsu 7262.T, Suzuki's president said on Tuesday.Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, is to buy its remaining stake in Daihatsu as part of a strategy to strengthen its push into compact cars for emerging markets -- a move likely to increase competition for Suzuki in one of its biggest and fastest-growing markets.Profit generation will become a more challenging proposition for Suzuki as multiple competitors seek to muscle in on the Indian market, Toshihiro Suzuki told reporters in New Delhi.“It is not only the Toyota alliance, but the entry of other international (car) manufacturers in India which is making the competition tougher,�� the Suzuki president said in Japanese through an interpreter.The company will need to build and sell cars that exceed buyers�� expectations and will also need to enhance its sales and service network, Suzuki said, as it plans to launch 20 new models globally by 2020, 15 of which will be brought to India.In the year to March 31 the company's Indian business Maruti Suzuki India MRTI.NS accounted for 41 percent of group sales. Maruti sold 1.2 million passenger vehicles in the period. Maruti is India's top-selling carmaker, with nearly 50 percent of the passenger vehicle market, but it faces growing competition from the likes of Hyundai 005380.KS and Honda 7267.T.The business is rationalising its production process and in the next five years will reduce the number of platforms on which it builds cars in India to three or four, Maruti’s head of engineering, C.V. Raman, told Reuters.This will enable the carmaker to use the same components in multiple models to achieve economies of scale and allow it to reduce car weights to improve fuel efficiency, Raman said.“It is one of the core engineering inputs ... to improve our competitiveness,�� Raman said, adding that parent company Suzuki will invest in developing the technology for the platform.To reduce dependence on India, Suzuki said the Japanese carmaker needs to increase sales in Europe and Asia while improving profitability in those regions.He said the company is not planning to form any kind of alliance with Toyota or any other carmaker but will instead work with component manufacturers and raw material suppliers to enhance safety and fuel-efficiency technology.	-4.730846161
(Repeats story first published on Wednesday with no changes to text)TOKYO, July 24 (Reuters) - Japan is readying subsidies to help Toyota Motor Corp and key suppliers take the lead in hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles that could top $400 million over the next several years if the most bullish projections for the technology play out.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s planned consumer rebates of at least $20,000 per vehicle would be the largest government support plan for hydrogen vehicles yet, raising the stakes for a commercially unproven technology with roots in the space race that Toyota and others see headed for the mainstream over the coming decades.The taxpayer-funded programme would bring down the cost of Toyota’s soon-to-be-launched hydrogen-powered fuel cell car to around $50,000 in Japan, about the cost of a small luxury sedan such as the BMW 3 Series.Abe announced the outline of the plan last week and details are still being finalised.The cost savings could be enough to make the Toyota vehicle affordable for taxi operators and other companies with fleets of vehicles within driving range of the 100 hydrogen fuelling stations that Japan expects to have built by March 2015.“It’s still difficult to make these cars popular among ordinary consumers, but the subsidy has certain effects on companies interested in promoting themselves as green,�� said Tomohide Kazama, Senior Consultant at Nomura Research Institute. “It’s a move to plant a seed for future growth.”Fuel cell vehicles, which run on electricity made by cells that combine hydrogen and oxygen, have been in testing since the 1960s, when the technology was also being developed by NASA.Since the vehicles emit only water and heat, they have been seen as an environmentally friendly alternative to those powered by combustion engines.It could also help Japan shift to hydrogen energy as the country, dependent on imported fossil fuel as an energy source after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, seeks to cut carbon emissions. While much of the hydrogen used in the country now is made from fossil fuel, the government hopes to implement carbon-free production by 2040.Promoting the technology last week, a smiling Abe test-drove Toyota’s fuel cell sedan, set to go on sale in Japan by end-March, and fuelled hydrogen into a Honda Motor Co FCX Clarity car, currently leased to governments and some companies.The challenges to commercial use of fuel cell cars have been the lack of a hydrogen fuelling infrastructure and their high cost. Abe’s government has taken aim at both barriers in the hope of protecting an area of emerging technology where automakers and suppliers believe they have a lead over rivals in the United States and Europe.The $20,000 rebate per car means taxpayers may support subsidies of up to around $200 million a year. Annual sales forecast for fuel cell vehicles in the early years of market introduction vary from several hundred to 10,000 vehicles.To put 100 hydrogen fuel stations in urban areas by end-March 2015, the ruling party has suggested a subsidy of up to $2 million per station - which cost $4-5 million each to build - meaning another $200 million in taxpayer money.The government plans to continue offering subsidies and tax breaks so that fuel cell cars can sell at around the same price as gas-electric hybrids in the 2020s.“The subsidy is a huge driving force for sales, but it won’t be offered forever and I think the message here is that we need to continue cutting costs,�� said Koichi Kojima, a senior Toyota engineer who has been involved in fuel cell vehicle development for a decade.The hydrogen supply chain has been benefiting from growing interest in the technology. Shares in Iwatani Corp, which opened the country’s first commercial hydrogen station in western Japan this month and plans to build a total of 20 stations by 2015, jumped nearly 50 percent this year, while hydrogen tank maker JFE Container rose 14.3 percent.Besides Toyota, Honda also plans to start selling its fuel cell vehicle in 2015. Automakers including General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co have been working on fuel cells for years and Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co lease fuel cell cars in the United States, but so far there are no plans for sales in Japan.That means the subsidy will be offered exclusively to Toyota and Honda for the time being.The announcement came as Washington and Tokyo are deadlocked over U.S. access to the Japanese auto market in talks for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a regional trade pact.“I don’t see it being a friction in terms of a trade issue,�� said Ron Cogan, editor of Green Car Journal. “I see it being a useful subsidy to help automakers that are going to be grappling with very high costs in developing very advanced vehicles.�� (Editing by Alex Richardson)	-3.777852237
DETROIT, April 22 (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s return to selling smaller pickups in the United States has resuscitated a moribund market segment, but new data highlights the risk that the automaker’s new trucks are cannibalizing sales of higher-priced models.Since the launch last autumn of the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, the midsize pickup segment has grown to more than 2 percent of the total U.S. car and light truck market from 1.4 percent last summer. Some industry executives believe the segment could double annual sales to 500,000 vehicles, which would have been 3 percent of last year’s market.However, beneath the encouraging numbers for the Colorado and Canyon are some less positive trends, said IHS Automotive analyst Tom Libby. Nine of the top 10 vehicles previously owned by buyers of the Colorado and Canyon are GM cars and trucks.Owners of full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks made up more than 16 percent of the consumers who switched into both smaller GM pickups, according to IHS data.“That was ominous,�� Libby said. “There may be a deeper issue here�� related to the potential for undercutting sales of higher-margin models.Libby said it was early in the life of the new midsized trucks and the actual number of consumers who switched from other GM vehicles was small by comparison.GM officials said the IHS data fails to take into account new buyers and Canyon marketing manager Kenn Bakowski said more than half of all the sales of the new trucks are buyers new to the company.GM’s new trucks have taken a bite out of long-time midsized pickup segment leader, Toyota Motor Corp’s Tacoma. Last month, GM President Dan Ammann called the smaller trucks “a very good investment.”�It’s a sleeper segment with huge opportunity,�� Rich Latek, GMC’s director of marketing, said in an interview. GM recently added a third shift at the Wentzville, Missouri, plant where their trucks are built because demand is so strong. The automaker plans to offer a diesel version to expand the appeal of the models.The Colorado and Canyon represent one leg of what GM executives call a “three-truck strategy.�� The other two are the large and heavy-duty versions of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which are bigger and sell at higher prices.The Colorado and Canyon, like the Toyota Tacoma, are aimed at people who want the utility of a pickup, but more for recreation - such as carrying bikes or camping gear - than for hauling lumber or oil field gear. The Colorado starts at about $20,120, about $6,000 less than the larger Silverado pickup.Dealers say they are happy with the new trucks. “It’s the right truck at the right time,�� AutoNation Inc Chief Executive Mike Jackson said. “They saw something that others doubted.”Still, it is not clear that demand will soon surpass the 1986 peak, when smaller pickups made up more than 9 percent of the market with more than 1.4 million sales, according to GM.Midsized trucks generate less than the $10,000-$12,000 in profit per vehicle of the full-size models according to analysts, but GM officials said they are money-makers and a component of their strategy to achieve 10 percent profit margins in North America. Since their launch last fall, GM has sold 37,351 Colorado and Canyon trucks through March.Demand for larger pickups remains much greater, however. Chevrolet sold 45,193 Silverados in March alone.LMC Automotive sees the midsize segment hitting 2 percent of the overall market this year but slipping back under that by 2020. LMC forecasts Colorado sales to hit just over 74,000 this year but to fall by 8.4 percent over the next five years, and Canyon sales to hit almost 29,500 this year but slide almost 21 percent in the subsequent five years.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Matthew Stover said GM’s smaller trucks will generate decent profit, but the smaller trucks are more significant for Latin America and Asia.“Too many other products have emerged in the market to fill the place of the midsized pickup truck,�� Stover said.Toyota, meanwhile, is gearing up to defend its position in the United States with a redesigned Tacoma due to launch this fall. The Tacoma has lost share in the segment, but its sales are still up almost 13 percent so far this year.“Our biggest issue right now is trying to keep our dealers supplied,�� said Bill Fay, group vice president for Toyota’s U.S. sales. Toyota added a third shift at its truck plant in Baja, Mexico.Fay predicts the midsized truck segment could rise as high as 500,000 U.S. sales, which would be double last year’s level. Tacoma sales could improve by more than 6 percent this year to about 165,000 trucks, he said, and rise another 10,000 or more next year.And the segment will likely grow more crowded. Hyundai Motor Co is eyeing the smaller end of the market, and Daimler’s Mercedes has said it will focus initially on non-U.S. markets.However, GM’s U.S. rivals - Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - are still unconvinced of the viability of smaller trucks.“We are investing in and expanding our F-Series lineup for the North American market,�� Doug Scott, Ford Truck group marketing manager, said of the company’s full-size truck. “The compact pickup segment in the U.S. has been declining.�� (Editing by Joseph White and Matthew Lewis)	-2.361199745
* Exec Julie Hamp was appointed in April in diversity drive* President Akio Toyoda says no change to diversity policy* Indictment could lead to years in prison - criminal lawyer (Adds comment from Toyota president)TOKYO, June 19 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp moved into damage control mode on Friday after its new communications chief Julie Hamp, an American and its first senior woman executive, was arrested on suspicion of illegally bringing pain killers into Japan just two months after her appointment.Toyota President Akio Toyoda apologised for the incident at a news conference and reiterated the company’s belief that Hamp had no intent of breaking the law.“To me, executives and staff who are my direct reports are like my children,�� he said.“It’s the responsibility of a parent to protect his children and, if a child causes problems, it’s also a parent’s responsibility to apologise.”Japanese media reports, citing police investigators, said 57 addictive Oxycodone pills were found in a small parcel labelled “necklaces�� that was sent from the United States and addressed to Hamp in Japan. The pills were in packets or buried at the bottom of the parcel, which also contained toy pendants and necklaces, they said.Hamp, a former General Motors Co and PepsiCo Inc executive, told police she did not think she had imported an illegal substance, a spokesman for Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police Department said.A police official declined to comment on the latest media reports about the parcel.Hamp was appointed managing officer in April as part of a drive to diversify Toyota’s male-dominated, mostly Japanese executive line-up. She joined Toyota’s North American unit in 2012 and this month relocated to Tokyo, where she was to be based. She had been staying in a hotel, a Toyota spokeswoman said.Toyoda vowed that the automaker would maintain its policy of seeking out talent regardless of gender or nationality and expressed regret that the company had not provided enough support for an employee who was not Japanese and had come to live in Japan.Oxycodone is a prescription drug in both the United States and Japan. Bringing it into Japan requires prior approval from the government and it must be carried by the individual, a health ministry official said.Hiroaki Okamoto, a criminal defence lawyer at the Nakamura International Criminal Defense Office in Tokyo who is not involved in Hamp’s case, said the large number of pills meant that, if indicted, she could face years in prison, followed by deportation.The maximum sentence for smuggling drugs with the intent to sell is life in prison, he said. Even if indicted for smuggling for personal use, it would be tough to get a suspended sentence because of the large number of pills, he said.

Oct 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp must face trial over claims that it failed to warn the public about design defects that caused certain vehicles to accelerate unintentionally, a federal judge in California has ruled.U.S. District Judge James Selna in the Central District of California on Monday denied Toyota’s motion to dismiss defective-design and failure-to-warn claims brought against it by the estate of Ida St. John, who said in 2009 her 2005 Camry sped out of control and hit a school building. She died after giving that testimony, but the lawsuit does not claim that her death was caused by the crash.The judge did grant the Japanese automaker’s motion to dismiss manufacturing defect and negligence claims.St. John testified that her Camry accelerated even though she did not press the pedal. The trial, slated to begin Nov. 5, will be one of the first of the many federal lawsuits focusing on the Toyota acceleration issues that prompted the automaker to recall millions of vehicles beginning in 2009.The first federal sudden-acceleration case to go to trial ended with a win for Toyota in 2011, in a lawsuit brought by a doctor who worked in Brooklyn.A representative for Toyota did not immediately return a request for comment.A lawyer for the St. John estate, Todd Walburg, said in a statement, “It’s time for a jury to hear about the defects that we’ve been studying over the past three years.”Since the recall, more than 500 individual and 200 proposed class-action lawsuits have been filed against Toyota in U.S. federal and state courts, according to a regulatory filing from the Japanese automaker.In her lawsuit, St. John said Toyota received thousands of complaints about unintentional acceleration in vehicles equipped with an electronic throttle control systems, which connects the accelerator to the engine. The company failed to warn customers, she alleged.Toyota asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying the collision could have been caused by driving errors and contending that St. John did not demonstrate a connection with alleged defect or system failure in the vehicle.But the judge on Monday said that testimony St. John previously gave, coupled with expert evidence submitted by the plaintiffs, “supports inferences from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the Camry continued to accelerate and failed to slow or stop despite her application of the brakes.”Selna also presided over a separate group of lawsuits over alleged economic losses stemming from acceleration issues. He signed off in July on a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve those claims, which did not include personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits.In a separate case, jurors in California state court are deliberating in the first sudden-acceleration to be tried there, involving the death of a woman after her 2006 Camry crashed into a tree.	-0.5621047701
* French judge tells hearing the ��stakes are big��* Ban has held up sales of thousands of cars* Toyota switches three models back to banned coolant (Adds detail on judicial procedure)PARIS, Aug 23 (Reuters) - France’s top administrative court said it would decide on Tuesday whether to suspend a government ban on the sale of some of Daimler’s cars in France in a row over coolant fluid.France held up the sale of thousands of Daimler’s Mercedes Benz cars after the German carmaker chose not to equip them with a new, more environmentally friendly coolant.Daimler has asked the court for an injunction suspending the government’s ban, arguing that the new refrigerant, known as R1234yf, poses a potential fire hazard.“The stakes are big,�� Jacques-Henri Stahl, president of the tribunal judging the case in the Council of State, told lawyers for Daimler and the French government during a two-hour hearing on Friday. “We’re at the heart of overlapping national and European issues.”A lawyer for Daimler, Denis Garreau, said the ban affected 60 percent of the company’s sales in France.“No other (EU) member state has taken the measures that France has taken,�� he said, calling it a “brutal decision�� to suspend sales. “Daimler’s position has been jeopardized in France.”The Council of State’s presiding judge could temporarily suspend the government’s ban on Tuesday, and might also order the government to resume assigning licence plates to Mercedes cars on a temporary basis.There could then be a further, more drawn-out judicial procedure in which several Council of State judges would consider whether the ban should be permanently overruled.France has argued that the ban is legally permissible under an EU law that protects the environment and public health.Japanese carmaker Toyota also confirmed it had stopped using the flammable air-conditioning refrigerant in its cars sold in Europe, responding to public pressure in Germany.“We have equipped three models with the old refrigerant in order to respect our customers�� safety concerns because of the controversy in Germany,�� a spokesman for the carmaker said.While Toyota remained “very confident�� about the new coolant’s safety, the company wanted to avoid being drawn into the debate, he said.The group is no longer producing any vehicles for Europe with the R1234yf refrigerant manufactured by Honeywell and DuPont. Previously, its Toyota Prius Plus, Lexus GS and GT86 were all equipped with the chemical.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Self-driving cars, trucks, sidewalk robots and shuttles are rolling out of the labs and parking garages and onto American streets to help deliver groceries, meals, and medical supplies.Although self-driving car companies have paused on-road testing in the U.S., as it is not considered an essential business, pivoting to deliveries allows them back on the road to gather more data.Since mid-April, the cars of General Motors Co's GM.N self-driving unit Cruise have flashed a ""SF COVID-19 Response"" sign on their windshields as they deliver food from SF-Marin Food Bank and SF New Deal to seniors in need. Each car has two safety drivers; one wears a mask and gloves to drop bags off at the door. “We’re not making a fundamental pivot away from ride-sharing,�� said Rob Grant, vice president of government affairs at Cruise. “What I do see is this pandemic really showing where self-driving vehicles can be of use in the future. That includes in contactless delivery like we’re doing here.”Toyota-backed Pony.ai said its cars are back on the street in California after a pause. Now they are delivering groceries in Irvine from local e-commerce platform Yamibuy and work with the City of Fremont to deliver meals to a local emergency shelter program.Meanwhile, in early April Softbank-backed Nuro became the second company in California to receive a permit to operate a driverless vehicle on public roads. Co-founder Dave Ferguson said Nuro was putting its latest R2 vehicles to work delivering medical supplies to a temporary COVID-19 hospital in Sacramento and a temporary medical facility in San Mateo County.None of the those three companies are making any money from their deliveries, but are gaining experience and data on delivery operations, several operators said.Beep, an autonomous shuttle service provider, said in early April that it was partnering with the Jacksonville Transportation Authority and shuttle maker Navya to transport COVID-19 tests at Mayo Clinic in Florida.Self-driving truck company TuSimple, in which United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N has invested, has kept its 40 autonomous trucks on the road for paying customers, but is offering a free service��for food banks in Texas and Arizona, according to its chief product officer, Chuck Price.And on Wednesday, Russian tech giant Yandex, which has a self-driving car team, said the pandemic helped speed up the signing of its first commercial contract with the city of Skolkovo, a tech hub, to help deliver mail and small packages using its sidewalk robot, Yandex.Rover."	2.314103083
"(Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTAS) said Wednesday it is reviving a long-stalled effort to overhaul the five-star crash rating program for all new vehicles.In 2015, under President Barack Obama, NHTSA proposed requiring automakers to add crash avoidance technologies to gain top, five-star ratings as part of its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). Those changes were set to start in the 2019 model year but have been on hold as the auto safety agency held additional public hearings.NHTSA’s acting chief, James Owens, said in a statement Wednesday the agency would propose “propose significant updates and upgrades�� in 2020 “by creating additional market-based incentives for automakers to continue investing in innovative safety technologies that will save lives and prevent injuries.”On Thursday, a group plans to hold a press conference in Washington criticizing NHTSA’s failure to update the ratings. The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended pedestrian collision avoidance systems and forward collision avoidance systems to be added to the program.Critics note the vast majority of new vehicles achieve four or five-star ratings, making it difficult for consumers to differentiate between vehicles.NHTSA said potential changes include “new test procedures, updates to vehicle labeling, advancements in crash-test dummies... and new technologies tied to the safety of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users such as cyclists.”The 2015 proposal sought to prod automakers to add advanced technologies including forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind-spot detection, lower beam head lighting, semi-automatic headlamp beam switching, amber rear turn signals, rear automatic braking and pedestrian automatic emergency braking and to factor those in to setting the ratings of up to five stars.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co GM.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and others, told NHTSA last year ""it is important that any new additions to NCAP significantly increase real-world safety. If not, they willonly increase vehicle cost without any commensurate real-world safety benefit.”Automakers covet five-star ratings, so new rules could effectively require manufacturers to make technology currently offered as pricey options on some vehicles standard equipment on all vehicles.NHTSA in 2015 proposed adding a new frontal crash test, new pedestrian crashworthiness testing and add two new advanced crash test dummies.The tests are only to set crash ratings included on new car window stickers - not for crash tests needed for U.S. vehicles to be legally sold."	5.627068775
DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE core autos division increased vehicle sales to a record 6.23 million cars last year, as rising demand for VW brand models in the Americas and the key Chinese market offset a decline in western Europe.Although the emissions test-cheating scandal of September 2015 has cost the German group billions of euros in fines and penalties, it does not seem to have caused major damage to the carmaker’s popularity with consumers.Deliveries rose 4.2 percent in 2017 to 6.23 million Volkswagen (VW) brand cars, the automaker said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show, helped by an expanding line-up of sport-utility vehicles including the all-new Atlas and Teramont models.The carmaker expects to keep growing volume this year.“Based on economic forecasts and our plans for new models, there is no reason to expect that 2018 should turn worse than 2017,�� VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show, declining to be more specific.Higher deliveries at the mass-market brand, accounting for almost 60 percent of VW group sales, may have helped the Wolfsburg-based company beat Toyota 7203.T for a second year in the global sales race. VW's premium divisions, Audi NSUG.DE and Porsche, had already posted record 2017 deliveries last week.Toyota said last month it expected to sell 10.35 million cars worldwide in 2017 across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands, up 2 percent from 2016, and 10.5 million this year. VW is due to announce 2017 deliveries for the group as a whole on Jan. 17.In China, Volkswagen’s largest market, accounting for about half the core brand’s deliveries, sales rose 5.9 percent last year to 3.18 million cars. In the United States, they were up 5.2 percent to 339,700 cars.Deliveries dropped 2.5 percent to 1.43 million cars in the higher-margin, but diesel-heavy western European market as customers reacted to a backlash against diesel technology in the wake of Volkswagen’s emissions trickery.Sales of the VW brand, which is pushing a turnaround plan to revive profits, may continue to outpace rivals, according to industry forecaster IHS Markit.Deliveries of VW passenger cars and light commercial vehicles could increase 14.6 percent to 7.75 million units by 2025 from 6.76 million last year, IHS data indicated.That compares with gains of 11.6 percent to 9.65 million at Toyota and 3.7 percent to 5.84 million at Ford F.N.	-1.811988113
Custer captures Drivin�� for Linemen winBy Chris KnightNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed for The Sports XchangeMADISON, Ill. -- Cole Custer took advantage of a five-lap shootout at Gateway Motorsports Park to post his second career NASCAR Camping World Truck Series win in Saturday night’s American Ethanol presents the Drivin�� for Linemen 200 brought to you by Ameren.When race leader Tyler Reddick missed his second shift of the night on the final restart, Custer attacked and cleared the field to cruise to a 0.871-second win over Spencer Gallagher. It was the 17-year-old NASCAR Next driver’s first victory of the year and second for JR Motorsports, which won last month at Charlotte Motor Speedway with Kasey Kahne.“I was just trying to tell myself ‘no excuses,’� said Custer, who won in his third start of the year. “I think we were a little bit better than the 19 (Reddick). We struggled a little bit all day.“I don’t know, I’m just tired. I gotta thank Haas Automation, Gene Haas, Kelley (Earnhardt-Miller), Dale (Earnhardt Jr.) for giving me this opportunity and Hendrick engines, the pit crew for coming out. We put everything together, we didn’t have the best truck, but we ran a great race.”After Matt Crafton and Erik Jones, who had the two strongest trucks of the night, endured problems late in the race, the revolving door opened and Custer answered.For Gallagher, late-race strategy played into his hands, which ultimately led to his second career top-five finish.��(We) didn’t have the speed in our No. 23 Allegiant Travel Chevrolet that we wanted all day, but we started 14th, so pretty far back there and a track where track position is such a huge deal, that was kind of a cloud hanging over our head to begin with,�� Gallagher said. “My GMS Racing guys played the game right all night. We were able to hold off (Johnny) Sauter at the end there. I told my crew chief, better be lucky than good sometimes, I’ll take it.”Mother Nature played her hand early at Gateway, canceling qualifying after a brief, but heavy shower a few minutes into round one of knockout qualifying. The field was set per the rule book, putting Jones on the pole after turning the fastest lap in practice earlier in the day.Quickly the track dried, but the start of the eighth race of the season was delayed nearly two hours after a heavy shower soaked the 1.25-mile oval shortly before pre-race ceremonies. Drivers were called to their trucks at 10:25 p.m. ET, with the command to fire engines less than 10 minutes later.From the start, Jones kept the lead and held the point until the first caution waved on Lap 53 for a two-truck accident in Turn 1.Crafton won the race off pit road ahead of Jones, Matt Tifft, Sauter and Reddick.Racing resumed, but Crafton’s lead would be short-lived as Jones made the pass on the outside and retook the lead from the defending series champion. Despite being chased by Crafton, Jones kept the lead until the second yellow flag waved on Lap 80 for debris.While Jones elected to pit, Crafton stayed out, while Reddick, Sauter, Brandon Jones and Austin Theriault played strategy and took two tires. Jones was the first truck that elected for four tires and exited pit road sixth.Crafton held the lead through Lap 91 when Tifft crashed in Turn 1.Under the third caution of the race, Crafton pitted, handing the lead to Sauter, his teammate, with Custer second.Restarting with 64 laps to go, Sauter found himself unable to hold off Custer, who ventured out to a half-second lead by Lap 100. Ten laps later, Custer had company in the form of Jones, who made the pass to reclaim the lead on Lap 112.Six laps later, a stalled truck brought out another yellow, sending the lead lap trucks to pit road for service. A flawless stop by Crafton’s team sent him back to the top ahead of Gallagher, who took two tires. Jones exited third, followed by Ray Black Jr. with no tires, and Reddick.On the restart, Crafton was able to stay ahead, but Jones, hungry for his first win of the season, was quickly closing. Ultimately, Jones spun on the front stretch 17 laps from the finish while trying to pass a lapped truck.With Jones out of the mix, Crafton found Reddick, Custer and John Hunter Nemechek looking to deny him of his fourth win of 2015.The green flag resumed with 10 laps remaining and Reddick wasted no time making his move and surging to the lead. Crafton’s strong night would take a dramatic turn after Nemechek broke loose in Turn 3 and sent the No. 88 Toyota hard into the outside wall, yielding the sixth caution of the night.Custer jumped out to the lead on the final restart and cruised the rest of the way to Victory Lane.Behind Custer and Gallagher, Sauter, Nemechek and Cameron Hayley rounded out the top five. Timothy Peters, Ben Kennedy, Reddick, Daniel Hemric and Theriault completed the top 10.“I always knew that we had trucks capable of winning,�� Custer said. “We just had to put everything together for a race.”NASCAR Camping World Truck Series RaceAmerican Ethanol presents the Drivin for Linemen 200 brought to you by AmerenGateway Motorsports ParkMadison, IllinoisSaturday, June 13, 20151.

TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average was little changed on Tuesday as investors weighed hopes of economic re-openings against concerns about further waves of coronavirus infections.Many investors also looked to a barrage of earnings announcements due later in the day, including those from Toyota Motor, the biggest Japanese company by market cap.The Nikkei share average fell 0.02% to 20,387.35 points, a day after it hit a two-month high. It has risen 18.9% from a trough hit on March 19. The broader Topix was down 0.08% to 1,479.35.“I think the market is still retaining an uptrend,�� said Yuya Fukue, trader at Rheos Capital Works.“At the same time, I expect the polarisation of the market to continue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday it had told its U.S. dealers to disclose, at the time of sale, the identity of vehicles with defective Takata air bag inflators that will be subject to recalls by 2018.After criticism by members of Congress, the automaker made public a list of vehicles with inflators subject to future recalls. They include the 2016 Toyota 4Runner and Lexus GX460 still in production. Dealers may also have in stock new 2015 Lexus IS250C/350C and Scion xB, and the 2015 Lexus GX460 and Toyota 4Runner, the company said.Takata inflators can explode with excessive force and spray metal shrapnel. They are suspected in 13 deaths worldwide and more than 100 injuries.Last month, Takata 7312.T agreed to declare as defective, by 2019, another 35 million to 40 million U.S. inflators that lack drying agents in frontal airbags. To date 15 automakers have announced recalls of 16.4 million vehicles and worldwide nearly 100 million inflators have been declared defective.This week, Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, urged automakers to fix the vehicles before sale or at a minimum disclose the issue before people buy cars.Nelson praised Toyota, calling the announcement “a positive step for consumers. While I still think automakers shouldn’t be selling vehicles with defective airbags, at the very least car buyers should know they’re purchasing a vehicle that will be subject to a future recall.”U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that he agreed automakers should make the disclosures but said he lacked the legal authority to require them.Last week, a report from Nelson said Toyota said it would produce 175,000 U.S. vehicles with air bag inflators that would be subject to recalls by July but did not disclose the vehicles.The report also said Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T are also still selling new vehicles with defective air bags that will eventually need to be recalled.The vehicles are legal to sell but must be recalled by 2018.The NHTSA said there have been no ruptures in any vehicles built since 2008. According to the NHTSA, the vehicles do not become vulnerable to exploding airbags without long-term exposure to high humidity.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE group sales probably rose to around 10.7 million cars last year and kept the German behemoth ahead of Toyota 7203.T as the world's largest automaker, Bild am Sonntag reported, citing in-house VW estimates.Higher delivery figures across the group, which includes premium brands Audi NSUG.DE and Porsche, helped drive revenue above 220 billion euros ($264.62 billion) for the first time ever after the 2016 record of 217 billion euros, the newspaper said on Sunday.A spokesman at Wolfsburg-based VW declined comment on the report. VW is due to publish official 2017 group sales data on Jan. 17 and will release core financial results in late February.In 2016, the first full year after VW’s emissions test-cheating “Dieselgate�� scandal, group sales rose 3.8 percent to a record 10.3 million cars, helped by a double-digit increase in China and gains in Europe.Toyota said last month it expected to sell 10.35 million cars worldwide in 2017 across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands, up 2 percent from 2016, and 10.5 million this year.	2.96059954
March 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said Thursday it is investing $749 million in five U.S. plants and adding 586 jobs as it boosts engine production capacity and adds new hybrid models.President Donald Trump has prodded Japanese automakers to add more jobs in the United States as the White House has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles, on the grounds of national security.Toyota and other automakers have been heavily lobbying to block any new tariffs on imported vehicles.Toyota said it will invest $288 million in Alabama to increase annual engine capacity from 670,000 to 900,000 by the end of 2021 and will add new 4-cylinder and V6 engine lines. It will also invest $238 million in a Kentucky plant to build hybrid versions of the Toyota RAV4 and Lexus ES 300h.Toyota announced last year it would jointly build a new $1.6 billion plant with Mazda Motor Corp in Alabama.Toyota said it will exceed a 2017 pledge to invest $10 billion over five years with a new commitment to reach nearly $13 billion over the same period, including Thursday’s announcement.Toyota President Akio Toyoda will be in Washington Friday to deliver a speech in which he is expected to tout the new investments.

CAPE TOWN, Sept 8 (Reuters) - South Africa’s car makers, a key export and manufacturing industry, will sign a new three-year wage deal with militant union Numsa on Thursday, union and industry officials said.A National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa)source the deal would see workers get a 10 percent raise in 2016 and an 8 percent increase in each of the following two years.The deal end fears of labour unrest potentially affecting car makers such as Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota .	-1.887746503
SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil (Reuters) - Meeting in Brazil this week, auto executives from Toyota to GM talked up traditional fuel sources like ethanol, natural gas and diesel, underlining how South America’s protected auto market is likely to resist a broader global move toward electric vehicles for years to come.Even as automakers revamp their global businesses to focus on electric cars in Europe, North America and Asia, executives who oversee production in Brazil and Argentina are still prioritizing internal combustion engines - in part because of subsidies for locally plentiful fuels.“The future of Argentina’s energy is natural gas,�� said Cristiano Rattazzi, who heads the country’s unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, as well as its automakers trade group. He added that diesel fuel, out of favor in much of the world, also still has potential in Argentina.Argentina’s natural gas production is expected to increase dramatically as foreign oil companies and state-owned YPF pour investment into Vaca Muerta, one of the world’s largest shale gas reserves.Aurelio Santana, executive director of Brazil’s auto trade group, had similar things to say about ethanol, which powers many of Brazil’s cars.“It’s very important that the government supports investments in research and development involving ethanol,�� Santana said. “We need to maintain what we already have here.”The desire to stick to what they know underscores the political sway of local energy producers. Recently, Brazil’s legislature issued a series of tax incentives, dubbed Rota 2030, which offer significant benefits to car makers who choose to invest in ethanol research.The event took place in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the historic home of Brazil’s auto industry, which is still reeling from the shock earlier this year that Ford Motor Co would be shutting its plant in the city.Toyota Motor Corp is so far the only automaker to announce that it plans to make even a hybrid model in South America, featuring an engine that can run on electricity or either pure ethanol or gasoline.“It’s the best solution for our region,�� said Celso Simomura, Vice President for Toyota’s Brazil operation.General Motors Co earlier this month announced an investment of 10 billion reais ($2.58 billion) in Brazil over the next five years, but none of that will go to electric cars, said Carlos Zarlenga, GM’s chief for South America.GM will start importing electric vehicles this year to test the market, he added, but there are no plans yet to build them domestically.Volkswagen AG’s top executive for South America and the Caribbean, Pablo Di Si, said the German automaker was going to import six electric or hybrid models to Brazil by 2023. But he also said there were no plans to produce them locally.“In Latin America, we need to consider all the caveats,�� Di Si said, pointing to the lack of a legal framework for electric vehicles and not enough charging infrastructure. Volkswagen wants to sell 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025.Fiat’s Rattazzi was confident that the old ways would survive in South America in the medium term.“In 2030,�� he predicted, “the combustion engine will still have a place.��($1 = 3.8768 reais)	2.139965298
(Adds Wards�� light vehicle sales estimate, background on GM)DETROIT, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. new vehicle sales in July continued to show signs of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as Toyota Motor Corp on Monday posted its lowest sales decline since the virus outbreak slammed the sector in mid-March.The Japanese automaker said its sales in July fell 19% versus the same month in 2019, to 169,484 units. That was Toyota’s best month since before the pandemic shuttered North American production for two months and led to closed showrooms across numerous U.S. states.The rebound in U.S. auto sales since hitting a bottom in April has seen major automakers scramble to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships, especially in states where they remained open throughout the shutdowns.The rebound in sales, though, could be threatened by surging cases in southern and southwestern U.S. states, which have increased uncertainty over the U.S. economic recovery.Hyundai Motor Co reported a year-on-year gain of 0.6% in U.S. sales for July, selling 57,677 units.“Achieving an overall sales increase despite the ongoing pandemic is a tremendous accomplishment and speaks to the depth and quality of our product lineup and resiliency of our dealers,�� Hyundai’s North American sales chief, Randy Parker, said in a statement.The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for light vehicles sold in July was estimated at 14.52 million units, according to Wards Intelligence.General Motors last week said its ability to repay loans depended on a continued economic recovery and the assumption that U.S. new vehicle sales would finish the year at around 14 million units.

WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Tuesday will hear calls for requiring new safeguards as part of any effort to speed the adoption of self-driving cars on U.S. roads.At the same hearing, groups representing automakers and tech companies will tout benefits of autonomous vehicles and warn the United States risks falling behind China and others without new legal backing. U.S. lawmakers have been divided for years over what consumer and legal protections should be added to any self-driving legislation.Jeffrey Tumlin, director of transportation for San Francisco’s Municipal Transportation Agency will tell the Energy and Commerce subcommittee that Congress should require manufacturers to include event data recorders in autonomous vehicles to “preserve all information from sensors before a collision.”Tumlin’s written testimony, reviewed by Reuters, adds Congress should “ensure that every safety incident involving an autonomous vehicle is documented in a national database that is available to researchers and the public.”California requires companies testing self-driving cars to disclose all crashes involving the vehicles on public roads, even when under manual control. Those reports are made public as is data on disengagements of self-driving cars. Other states do not require those disclosures.John Bozzella, who heads an auto trade association representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp , Volkswagen AG and others, will testify “the worst outcome would be for Congress to delay the enactment of meaningful legislation that would establish the needed federal framework to realize these safety and mobility solutions.”Current regulations essentially bar deployment of vehicles without steering wheels and human controls unless they get approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The agency last week granted its first-ever temporary exemption for a fleet of riderless delivery vehicles from SoftBank Group Corp backed Nuro Inc.Automakers oppose requiring airplane-style certification of new autonomous vehicle technologies before they are deployed on U.S. roads and note NHTSA can demand removal of unsafe vehicles.Daniel Hinkle, a counsel at a trial lawyers group, says in his testimony that “those who are injured or harmed by automated driving must be able to hold the driver manufacturer accountable.”Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the panel, cast the issue in geopolitical terms, noting Chinese self-driving car developers in 2019 “logged the second-most miles of any country testing�� in California.“China is using our infrastructure, testing on our roads, collecting information on our citizens, and stealing our technology to beat us. There is a global race to (autonomous vehicles). Do we want China to win that race, or do we want to lead?�� she said.Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, will urge Congress to require tests for self-driving cars to ensure they can properly detect other vehicles and hazards and call for a mandatory manual override in all self-driving cars.Chase argues it is misleading to argue the United States was falling behind in commercial deployment. “We are behind in establishing comprehensive safeguards to ensure that this progress happens without jeopardizing or diminishing public safety,�� her testimony says.

* Sentra to be second of 5 all new vehicles in US* Canton plant to make seven vehicles by year’s endCANTON, Miss., June 28 (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co said it will add workers and start production of the Sentra compact sedan at its Canton plant in Mississippi later this year.Adding Sentra production along with two previously announced vehicles by the end of the year will mean 1,000 more jobs at the plant, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said at an event held at the Canton plant on Thursday.Nissan officials said 400 of those jobs have already been added to prepare for production of the Xterra mid-sized SUV and the mid-sized pickup truck Frontier, which is starting in November.Total employment at the Canton plant will rise to 4,500 by year’s end, Nissan officials said.The move comes amid efforts already under way by the United Auto Workers union to organize the existing 3,900 workers at the Nissan plant.The UAW, along with some Mississippi politicians and the head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), early this month announced an effort to organize the Canton Nissan workers.The Canton plant near the Mississippi state capital of Jackson is also the production site of Nissan’s best-selling Altima mid-sized sedan.The Sentra will be the second all-new model to hit U.S. dealerships in the next 15 months, Nissan said. Sales began a few weeks ago for the 2013 Altima, the first of those five new vehicles.By the year’s end, seven different vehicles will be made at the Canton plant, which Bryant said was a “remarkable�� accomplishment.Bill Krueger, vice chairman of Nissan Americas, said that in 2011, 69 percent of the Nissans sold in the United States were made in North America, and that by 2015, that figure will rise to 85 percent.Prior to the announcement on Thursday of the addition of Sentra production, Nissan had invested $2.06 billion at the plant, which opened in 2003. Krueger said Nissan will spend more than $20 million on capital improvements at the plant to add the new production.Production at Canton by next year will be 450,000 vehicles annually, up from the current capacity of 400,000, Krueger said.Last year, when Toyota Motor Corp opened a new plant near Tupelo in northern Mississippi, Bryant, then governor-elect, said he would resist UAW efforts to organize auto workers. He took the same stance on Thursday in Canton, but said that he will not spend state money to do so. Rather, he will support professional organizations that resist the union.“I don’t believe, personally, that we’d see this growth in the automobile industry to include Toyota and Nissan and the many suppliers if we had union growth in the state of Mississippi,�� Bryant told reporters at the Canton plant.The UAW has tried unsuccessfully to organize Nissan workers before. In 2001, workers at Nissan’s Smyrna, Tennessee plant voted overwhelmingly against joining the union.Companies looking to hire workers who are likely to be wooed by union organizers will carefully screen applicants, said Kristin Dziczek, labor relations expert at the Center for Automotive Research.“It is typical for firms to work very closely to screen their new workers for skills and characteristics,�� Dziczek said on Thursday.“I would expect these new workers to be screened for characteristics like gender balance and diversity and be screened for their union proclivities. The union knows it. The company knows it,�� said Dziczek.Nissan’s Krueger said: “We’re looking for great workers with a great attitude and willingness to learn, that’s really the key.”Nissan is aggressively adding to its production of vehicles at the Canton plant, its plant in Smyrna, Tennessee and in Mexico to boost the No. 2 Japanese automaker’s profile in the competitive U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets.Nissan’s goal is to achieve a 10-percent market share, up from 8.2 percent in 2011 and 6.2 percent in 2006, Krueger said.The Sentra for the North American market is now made at the Nissan plant in Aguascalientes in Mexico. Production of the Sentra will continue at Aguascalientes, Nissan officials said.Sentra sales fell 18 percent in the United States through May this year to 46,773, while Altima sales rose 21 percent to 135,289. Overall, Nissan sales, including its luxury Infiniti brand, rose 12 percent through May, less than the auto industry’s gain of 13 percent.In the United States, Nissan is the sixth-largest automaker and the third-biggest import brand after Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd.	-6.225149105

BERLIN (Reuters) - German automotive supplier SHW Automotive GmbH said a maker of electric cars had canceled a 100 million euro ($107 million) order, sending its shares down as much as 9.5 percent to a four-month low on Tuesday.SHW, which assembles pumps and engine components as well as brake discs, said the customer - which it didn’t name - had canceled an order awarded last September, and asked SHW to stop preparations for production, originally due to start in the first half of this year.SHW said the customer felt technical specifications for axle-drive pumps failed to meet its requirements.However, SHW said it did not accept this reason and reserved the right to seek damages.Shares in Aalen, Germany-based SHW were down 7.5 percent to 30.12 euros at 1321 GMT, having traded as low as 29.49 euros.Spokespeople in Germany for Renault-Nissan and Toyota - both major manufacturers of electric vehicles - didn’t return calls seeking comment, while a spokeswoman for U.S. luxury electric automaker Tesla had no immediate comment.	-4.443137914

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s president plans this week to name a new finance minister to oversee Southeast Asia’s largest economy, acting finance minister Hatta Rajasa said on Monday, with Investment Chief Chatib Basri seen as the leading contender.However, Basri declined to say if he would be appointed the next finance minister, telling Reuters “let’s wait for the announcement from the president.”If confirmed, the 47-year-old would replace Rajasa after less than a month at the helm.Rajasa took on the acting role after President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s surprise decision in February to nominate then-finance minister, Agus Martowardojo, as the sole candidate to head the central bank. Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution’s five-year term ends on May 22.If appointed, one of Basri’s first major challenges would be how to soften the impact of fuel subsidies which have driven a hole in the budget. So far the government has dithered at major changes, fearful of adding to inflation and nervous of the social tension an increase could trigger.Basri, who has a doctorate in economics, served as special adviser to former finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati before becoming Indonesia’s investment chief in October 2011.He has also served on the regional advisory board of Toyota Motor Asia, independent commissioner for PT Astra International, cement producer PT Semen Indonesia and coal producer PT Indika Energy.	-2.295610149
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Scott Kluth has a love-hate relationship with his new Fisker Karma luxury electric sedan.The 34-year-old car lover bought the plug-in hybrid electric Karma in December for $107,850, but five days later the car’s battery died as he was driving in downtown Chicago. While the car he affectionately calls a “head turner�� was fixed in a recall, Kluth remains uncertain how much he will drive it.“I just want a car that works,�� Kluth said. “It’s a fun car to drive. It’s just that I’ve lost confidence in it.”The Karma's problems -- one vehicle died during testing by Consumer Reports this month -- follow bad publicity arising from a probe of General Motors Co's GM.N Chevrolet Volt and weak sales of the car, and the closure or bankruptcy of several electric vehicle-related start-ups.The unrelenting bad news has led to questions about the readiness of electric cars and raises fresh doubts about a technology that has been around since the late 1890s but is still struggling to win over the public.Whether electric vehicles can find an audience beyond policymakers in Washington and Hollywood celebrities depends on lowering vehicle prices without selling cars at a loss, analysts and industry executives say, while extending driving range to make the cars competitive with their gasoline-powered peers.“It’s going to be a slow slog,�� said John O’Dell, senior green car editor at industry research firm Edmunds.com. “Maybe there’s too much expectation of more and quicker success than might realistically be expected of a brand new technology.”He also questioned whether priorities will simply change for whomever is U.S. president after the November election. Electric vehicles could lose tax breaks -- currently worth $7,500 a vehicle for buyers -- particularly if a Republican ends up in the White House.Edmunds expects pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids to make up only 1.5 percent of the U.S. market in 2017, compared with 0.1 percent last year, and O’Dell said that may be optimistic. Consumers charge all-electric cars by plugging into an outlet, while hybrid versions include a gasoline engine.President Barack Obama’s administration has been a strong proponent of electric vehicles like the Volt and set a goal of getting 1 million battery-powered vehicles on the road by 2015. Lux Research estimates that number will actually be fewer than 200,000. Both the Volt and Karma’s development were supported by low-interest federal loans.That has not dissuaded automakers, many of which plan to launch electric vehicles to join the Volt and Nissan's 7201.T all-electric Leaf in a bid to meet rising fuel efficiency standards. Toyota 7203.T has begun selling a plug-in Prius, and EVs from Ford F.N, Honda 7267.T, BMW BMWG.DE and Fiat FIA.MI will join the fray this year, along with cars from start-ups Tesla TSLA.O and Coda Automotive.Electric cars aren’t a new concept. Henry Ford bought his wife, Clara, at least two electric cars in the early 1900s offering at best 50 miles driving range and top speeds of about 35 miles per hour, according to the Henry Ford Museum.But analysts said automakers have not done a good enough job getting the costs down and explaining the technology to win over anyone beyond early adopters like actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pop idol Justin Bieber, comedian Jay Leno and former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.“You can do all the advertising and promotion you want, but if people don’t buy into the message the needle’s not going to move,�� said George Cook, a marketing professor at the University of Rochester’s business school and a former Ford executive.The Volt, at almost $40,000 before federal subsidies, is seen as too expensive by many critics. Fiat-Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, a long-time EV skeptic, has said Chrysler will lose more than $10,000 on every battery-powered Fiat 500 it sells.And even with rising gasoline prices -- topping $4 a gallon in parts of the country -- EVs are just not competitive, according to the Lundberg Survey. Gasoline prices would have to rise to $8.53 a gallon to make the Leaf competitive and hit $12.50 for a Volt to be worth it, based on the cost of gasoline versus electricity, fuel efficiency and depreciation, the survey said.Obama's vision, which he laid out at a Daimler DAIGn.DE truck plant in North Carolina this month, includes a car battery that costs half the price of today's versions and can go up to 300 miles on a single charge. The industry is far from achieving that.Since last fall, there has been a run of bad news for EVs, starting with the late November news that U.S. safety regulators were investigating the Volt for possible battery fires.While the federal investigation was closed with the conclusion there was no defect and the car did not pose a greater risk of fire than gas-powered vehicles, weak demand led GM to halt production for five weeks and temporarily lay off 1,300 workers at the plant that builds the car. GM, which strengthened the structural protection of the Volt battery, has repeatedly said the car is safe, and some said the safety probe should have never occurred.The Karma that died during testing by Consumer Reports magazine was another blow following a recall of more than 200 of the cars last year and the halting of sales in January for a software issue. Fisker, which builds the Karma in Finland, also suspended work last month at its U.S. plant scheduled to make another car, the Nina sedan, while it works to renegotiate a $529 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy.Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher said problems can arise with new technologies and a new company but added Fisker had gone “beyond the call of duty�� in instituting a system to respond to customer issues and had plenty of satisfied owners. CEO Tom LaSorda in a letter to Karma owners last week said Fisker was committed to giving customers “complete peace of mind�� and he had created a “SWAT team�� of 50 engineers and consultants to identify issues with the car.‘FIRST LAW OF DISNEY’�The expectations have always been too high for electric cars,�� said Bill Reinert, Toyota’s U.S. manager for advanced technology. “The realities have always been clouded by the dreams. I like to say it’s the first law of thermodynamics versus the first law of Disney. Disney is wishing it will be so. It doesn’t work.�� Toyota has always been skeptical EVs would quickly boost its share of the auto market.Meanwhile, several companies have struggled due to lack of funding or customer troubles.A123 Systems AONE.O posted a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss this month after Fisker, one of its largest customers, cut battery orders. Bright Automotive, an Indiana electric commercial truck start-up, closed its doors in February after failing to get a federal loan.Ener1 Inc HEVVQ.PK, which received a $118.5 million federal grant to make lithium-ion batteries for EVs, filed for bankruptcy in January, and Aptera Motors, a California-based EV start-up, went out of business last December after it couldn't raise $80 million in private funding.""There will be more companies that fail, but it's no different than Internet companies,"" said Kristen Helsel, vice president of EV solutions for AeroVironment AVAV.O, which makes EV charging stations for BMW, Mitsubishi 7211.T and Nissan. ""People with the right business model are going to do fine.""A number of top national retail chains, including Kohl's KSS.N and Walgreen WAG.N, have begun installing charging stations at their stores, but critics say the U.S. push for electric cars has come before such infrastructure is in place, weakening the case for consumers to be attracted to the technology.But since the bankruptcy of Solyndra, a solar panel maker that received $535 million in U.S. loan guarantees, federal support for advanced vehicle technology programs has ground to a halt. Industry officials and analysts point to tightened U.S. Department of Energy requirements in the face of withering criticism from Republicans about the Obama administration’s generosity for anything related to green technology.“There was certainly a different energy level one year ago, even two years ago,�� said Oliver Hazimeh, sustainable transportation practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. “This year, it just had a different drumbeat.�� Hazimeh sees long-term demand for EVs rising to up to 9 percent of the global market by 2022, but he predicts there will be some setbacks along the way.Obama wants to increase the tax subsidies for buyers of electric vehicles to $10,000 per vehicle from the current $7,500. But critics say the small EV sales totals tell the real story.Complicating matters, automakers continue to squeeze increased fuel efficiency out of the internal combustion engine. That makes it tougher to make EV sticker prices attractive enough to put a dent in the traditional gasoline-powered vehicles�� domination of the market.The EV’s industry’s struggles have vindicated the more deliberate approach taken by Toyota, Ford and Chrysler’s Marchionne, who killed plans for a Chrysler electric car, analysts said.Still, proponents say electric-car sales will grow just like Toyota’s hybrid Prius rose from about 5,500 in its U.S. debut in 2000 to a peak of more than 180,000 in 2007.Doug Parks, GM’s chief Volt engineer, said the proof is in the large amounts of money automakers are spending on EV technology development.“Follow the money. People are investing huge in this stuff,�� he said. “This is a 10- or 20-year discussion and we’ve been selling the Volt for a year.”GM, which recently launched a new advertising campaign centered on testimonials by adoring Volt owners, has made the car the centerpiece of efforts to seize from Toyota the mantle as the world’s greenest automaker. Meanwhile, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has estimated pure electric vehicles like the Leaf will make up 10 percent of industry global sales by 2020.Time will tell if that’s wishful thinking.“It’s been the Kool-Aid that the entire political system has been drinking for a decade,�� said Bob Martin, a senior consultant with auto product development firm The CarLab. “Electric cars are not ready for prime time. They’re really interesting toys for very, very rich people.��"	-5.922065616
TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp 6752.T could jointly produce batteries with U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O in China, as the Japanese electronics conglomerate looks to tap into that country's surging EV demand, its chief executive said on Thursday.“As already reported, Tesla could in the future launch full-fledged production in China - and we could produce jointly,�� Kazuhiro Tsuga said at an earnings briefing, in Panasonic’s first official acknowledgement of possible battery cell production for Tesla in the world’s biggest auto market.Panasonic currently produces battery cells for Tesla in Japan as well as at Tesla’s so-called Gigafactory in the U.S. state of Nevada. Tesla uses the cells to make battery packs.Battery cells are central to Panasonic’s plan to nearly double automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022 as it shifts away from low profit margin consumer electronics.The company said it expects battery cell sales to drive operating profit up 11.7 percent to 425 billion yen ($3.87 billion) in the year through March 2019.The outlook was in line with the 429.76 billion yen average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. However, it was below Panasonic’s 450 billion yen target set three years ago, with the company blaming a stronger yen that reduces the value of profit earned overseas.Panasonic expects profit at its automotive energy business, which includes battery cells, to more than double after production delays in Tesla’s mass-market Model 3 car pressured profit in the previous year.Tesla earlier this month promised to meet its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June.To reduce the risk of over-relying on Tesla, Panasonic has teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to jointly develop batteries for electric vehicles.“Discussions with Toyota have been making progress,�� Tsuga said.($1 = 109.9500 yen)	-0.6663286739

LONDON (Reuters) - Toyota’s Ott Tanak won Wales Rally GB on Sunday to stretch his lead over Citroen’s Sebastien Ogier in the world championship to 28 points with two rounds remaining.Ogier, who had been chasing his sixth win in seven years in Britain, finished third behind Hyundai’s Belgian Thierry Neuville.A maximum 60 points are still to be won in Spain and Australia but Ogier’s hopes of taking a seventh title look increasingly remote.Estonian Tanak, who can become the first non-French champion since Norwegian Petter Solberg in 2003, finished 10.9 seconds ahead of Neuville and also collected five bonus points from the day’s concluding power stage in North Wales.The victory was his fifth in seven races.Ogier was 23.8 seconds behind but runner-up in the power stage, banking four extra points. Team mate Esapekka Lappi was third and Neuville fifth for a sole bonus point.Tanak now has 240 points to Ogier’s 212, with Neuville the only other driver in mathematical contention on 199.Hyundai lead the manufacturers�� standings on 340 points to Toyota’s 332.The day’s clifftop Great Orme stage had to be canceled due to “rough sea conditions��, with organizers explaining that divers could not be deployed on a safety boat below the vertiginous drop.	7.030118185

TOKYO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - For a former James Bond car, it’s a chance to live twice.Japanese engineers put a new spin on an old classic car for a recent auto show, remodelling a Toyota 2000GT with solar panels and high-tech gadgets to make it 100 percent electric and solar-powered.Heralded as Japan’s first sports car when it came out in 1967, the vehicle was used in the James Bond movie “You Only Live Twice,�� released that same year, as a getaway car for the intrepid Bond, played by Sean Connery.But the new eco-friendly version comes with a catch -- it takes nearly two weeks for the vehicle to power up completely.“The engineer’s dream for this car is that the battery’s efficiency improves to the point that we could charge the car as we drive, and be able to drive without being limited by the need to stop,�� said Naohiko Saito, project manager at Toyota Motor Corp.The Achilles�� heel of electric cars for many sports car enthusiasts is the lack of horsepower, with many aficionados longing for the powerful revving sound of a speed machine.But the new version 2000GT comes with a playful solution -- a push of the accelerator brings a variety of sound effects, including meowing cats, clucking chickens and the sound of spaceships.“My personal favourite is the sound of horses�� hooves running,�� said Saito. “I can imagine that if this car approaches a regular vehicle, the passengers will be surprised to hear the sounds coming from it.”Only 337 models of the original automobile, designed by Toyota in collaboration with Yamaha, were made. It is considered a milestone in Japanese automotive history.There are no plans to mass produce the current vehicle, produced under the title “Crazy Car Project,�� but designers say it will race in electric vehicle competitions later this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N first proposed taking a controlling stake of more than one-third in Isuzu Motors Ltd 7202.T - an investment worth some $3 billion - but is now seeking a smaller holding after the Japanese truck maker said it wanted to remain independent, a person with direct knowledge of the talks said.GM is seen as eager to tap Isuzu’s strength in Southeast Asian markets and its diesel technology, and a deal would in many ways be a foray back to well travelled ground as the two companies were once equity partners for 35 years.The U.S. automaker at one point owned as much as 49 percent in Isuzu before selling the holding down, disappointed with red ink spilled by Isuzu at the time and later strapped for cash of its own. Its last remaining 7.9 percent stake was sold in 2006 for $300 million.Since emerging from its government-funded bankruptcy restructuring in 2009, GM has begun to forge some new alliances in efforts spearheaded by GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky.In March, GM agreed to pay $423 million for a 7 percent stake in French automaker Peugeot SA PEUP.PA. Last August, Girsky negotiated a tie-up with Korean conglomerate LG Corp 003550.KS to develop electric cars together.The current talks are, however, still very much preliminary, said the person who declined to be identified because the discussions are private.The re-emergence of GM as a strategic partner would help Isuzu share the burden of developing hybrid and other technologies as environmental regulations around the world tighten. The two firms also still cooperate in sales in Latin America and South Africa.A stake of 33.4 percent in Japan gives the shareholder veto powers over boardroom decisions and would be worth about $3.2 billion at Isuzu’s current share price. The Nikkei business daily has said that GM is seeking a holding of about 10 percent.Isuzu said in a statement on Tuesday it was considering a wide range of partnerships, including but not limited to GM, adding that it had made no decision yet.GM declined to comment. “While we do not comment on rumor and speculation, we routinely speak with other (automakers) on a range of issues,�� spokesman Klaus-Peter Martin said.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T currently owns 5.9 percent of Isuzu in addition to a majority stake in rival truck maker Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T and it remains unclear how Toyota will respond to GM's overtures to Isuzu.Toyota bought its stake in Isuzu with a view to jointly develop small diesel engines - a forte of Isuzu's - but that project was shelved after the global financial crisis. Toyota recently signed a deal to use BMW AG's BMWG.DE diesel engines in Europe.GM last year reclaimed its title as the world’s top-selling automaker from Toyota thanks to rapid growth in China, but it is a minor player in fast-growing Southeast Asian markets, where Toyota and other Japanese brands dominate.Isuzu had been discussing a possible tie-up with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE with little progress.Japan's other truck makers are all aligned with strategic partners: UD Trucks, formerly called Nissan Diesel, belongs to Sweden's Volvo AB VOLVb.ST and Mitsubishi Fuso belongs to Daimler AG DAIGn.DE.Isuzu's top shareholders are trading houses Mitsubishi Corp 8058.T and Itochu Corp 8001.T, with 9.2 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, followed by Toyota.Shares in Isuzu were trading up 1 percent on Wednesday morning in Tokyo, in line with the transport sector index .ITEQP.T.

FRANKFURT, April 10 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Tsusho is acquiring a 39.9 percent stake in loss-making Scholz AG, part of efforts to put the German metals recycling group’s finances back on a solid footing.Toyota Tsusho, part of the Toyota group, said in a statement on Thursday the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter after final negotiations with Scholz’s existing lenders.Scholz, burdened by 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of debt at the end of 2013, has been hit by weak metal and scrap markets. It has embarked on a restructuring after a period of rapid expansion and is selling smaller non-core operations and shutting some sites.Toyota Tsusho declined to specify how much it paid Scholz’s family owners for the stake.Toyota Tsusho - which prevailed against rival bids from a Chinese group and buyout group KKR - will also inject fresh equity into Scholz, according to a person familiar with the transaction.A separate sales process for Scholz’s aluminium and engineering steel businesses is planned to be concluded this quarter as the group seeks to reduce its debt to 700 million euros, the source added.Most of Scholz’s debt is in bank loans, some of which have been bought up by private equity and hedge funds such as Davidson Kempner, SVP and TPG.Scholz booked a post-tax loss of 314 million euros in 2013 on revenues of 3.5 billion euros, weighed down by charges relating to the restructuring.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday dismissed a criminal charge against Toyota Motor Corp after the Japanese automaker completed three years of monitoring under a $1.2 billion settlement in which it admitted to misleading the public about sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles.U.S. District Judge William Pauley in New York agreed to a U.S. Justice Department request to end the case stemming from Toyota’s admission that it misled U.S. consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about the extent of sudden acceleration problems in 2009 and 2010.Toyota had agreed to three years of oversight by an independent monitor that ended in August.In bringing charges in March 2014, the Justice Department said that Toyota minimized problems, misled regulators and provided inaccurate information to Congress in the scandal linked to at least five deaths.The $1.2 billion settlement was the largest penalty levied by the United States on an auto company until Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE admitted to diesel emissions fraud earlier this year and paid $4.3 billion in fines.Toyota spokesman Scott Vazin said on Thursday the company was pleased the court accepted the recommendation. “Over the past three years, we have worked hard in the spirit of continuous improvement to make Toyota a stronger company that serves its customers better,�� he said.Pauley said in 2014 the case represented a “reprehensible picture of corporate misconduct,�� and expressed hope the government would ultimately hold the responsible decision-makers at Toyota accountable.In his order on Thursday, Pauley said: “Regrettably, the payment of a $1.2 billion fine and the appointment of a monitor appear to have concluded the government’s investigation into this tragic episode.”Toyota made significant changes to its safety practices after the recall crisis that briefly forced it to halt sales of nearly half of its vehicles in 2010 and led to the company president, Akio Toyoda, appearing before Congress to apologize.Toyota settled other related suits, including an agreement covering as many as 22 million current and former Toyota owners over sudden acceleration claims valued at as much as $1.63 billion. There are still individual civil claims pending in California.	3.08525478

* Plan gets about 75 pct of ��yes�� votes in preliminary count* Toyota aims to attract long-term individual shareholders* Some pension funds and proxy adviser ISS had opposed the plan* Controversy over the plan seen discouraging similar moves (Updates Toyota retail investor ratio, adds corporate lawyer comment )By Maki ShirakiTOYOTA CITY, Japan, June 16 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp shareholders approved a controversial new class of stock on Tuesday that will bring in more long-term investors, but which faced opposition from foreign funds as the shares are only readily available in Japan.About 75 percent of shareholders voted in favour of allowing the new shares, which will be unlisted and must be held for five years. After that, shareholders can convert them into common stock or have Toyota buy them back at their issue price.Toyota has argued its business requires long-term product planning and has designed the plan to lift its ratio of retail investors committed to the company. Individual investors account for 10.5 percent of its shares, below the 20 percent average for listed Japanese firms.“The approval rate is quite high,�� said Yo Ota, a corporate lawyer at Tokyo-based law firm Nishimura &amp; Asahi. “There are very few types of equity instruments in Japan, so if this move leads to further diversification, that would be welcome.”But the controversy over the scheme is likely to discourage others, analysts said, adding that any company planning a similar move would also need a robust balance sheet. To prevent dilution of common stock, Toyota will buy back the same number of shares.Japan’s biggest automaker required a two-thirds majority for approval and the vote had been seen as close as foreign investors account for about 30 percent of its shares.The vote also came as new corporate governance code takes effect in Japan, encouraging investors to voice concerns and forcing companies to consider the views of those who object to management-backed proposals.Funds like the California State Teachers�� Retirement System decried the lack of easy access for foreign investors and proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended a ‘no�� vote, saying it may lead to less incentive for Toyota to maintain fiscal discipline.But proxy adviser Glass, Lewis &amp; Co spoke in favour of the proposal, saying it would give the automaker more flexibility.Toyota plans to eventually issue 150 million shares, named “Model AA�� after its first passenger car. That would be less than 5 percent of its shares outstanding.It argues the shares would give investors more options in a country where the majority of the $14 trillion in financial assets held by individuals are in cash deposits.Japan’s cash deposits currently earn virtually nothing in interest. Model AA shares will have a fixed dividend of 0.5 percent in the first year, rising by the same increment annually to reach 2.5 percent in the fifth year.But they will be priced at a 20 percent premium to common stock in exchange for the guarantee that they can be resold at the issuance price.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Four Japanese automakers on Thursday said they found no safety issues with aluminum parts supplied by Kobe Steel Ltd 5406.T, allaying some concerns that falsified quality data on products from the steelmaker had compromised their vehicles.Kobe Steel shares surged after the car makers�� statements, but the steelmaker still has to contend with a U.S. Justice Department probe, while checks continue at hundreds of companies involved in complex supply chains spanning the globe.Japan’s third-biggest steelmaker admitted earlier this month it falsified specifications on the strength and durability of aluminum, copper and steel products, along with materials for optical disks. The falsifications stretch back for more than 10 years, a senior executive told Reuters this week.Since then, global automakers, aircraft companies and other manufacturers have scrambled to identify potential hazards in their products.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Mazda Motor Co 7261.T said that hoods and other exterior parts used in their cars which were made from aluminum directly supplied by Kobe Steel were safe.Kobe Steel shares ended the day nearly 7 percent higher but are still down by more than a third since it announced the data falsification.Automakers are still making checks on other parts, including those that they received through their parts suppliers.“We confirmed that the materials satisfy applicable statutory standards, and our own internal standard, for key safety and durability requirements for vehicles,�� Toyota said in a statement.Toyota, one of the world’s largest automakers, identified aluminum plates supplied by Kobe Steel for the hoods and rear hatches of Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles. Though outside the automaker’s specifications, they were still safe to use.While Subaru 7270.T and other carmakers said they were still investigating the issue, the announcements by Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mazda suggest that Kobe Steel's cheating scandal may have a limited impact on product safety. “SERIOUS SITUATION”Nonetheless, the company’s fate hangs in the balance while checks are being carried out. It must report to Japan’s industry ministry by around the end of next week on any safety concerns and provide a more extensive account of the problems a fortnight later.Industry leaders have reached a consensus that Kobe Steel is in a “serious situation,�� a senior Japanese manufacturing executive told Reuters.“For a manufacturer, quality control is the most important thing and they were cheating for many years. This was a shock to their customers, who can no longer trust Kobe Steel,�� the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.This was the view of Japanese industry leaders, even though no safety issues have so far been identified, the executive said.Kobe Steel customers will seek compensation for the cost of replacements and checks but “I do not think they are leaning toward lawsuits,�� he said, adding that as far as he had heard there will be no recalls.Overseas customers, especially those in the United States, present more of a threat though, in light of the Justice Department investigation.“I would think there will demands for quite a bit of compensation (from U.S. companies),�� he said.In Europe, aviation safety authorities earlier this week issued a directive advising aircraft manufacturers to avoid using Kobe Steel products if they can until checks are completed.There was no manual providing guidance to staff on cheating product specifications, a senior Kobe Steel executive told reporters, on condition of anonymity.Japanese media reported that staff used such a document, but the executive said he did not know whether memos were passed around among staff.Some of the data tampering was an abuse of an industry practice known as “tokusai��, a kind of special waiver, that is agreed between buyer and supplier, the executive said.Buyers will accept products or materials that do not quite meet agreed specifications, the executive explained. The problems occurred where products were falsely labeled or where the specifications were outside those agreed with the customer but labeled as within specifications, he said.Board members of Kobe Steel were “absolutely not aware�� of an abuse of tokusai, he said.Two certification companies confirmed that they are investigating whether Kobe Steel was in line with ISO9001, a global standard on overall quality control.Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd and Japan Quality Assurance Organization said they may suspend or cancel ISO9001 certification of Kobe Steel’s plants or subsidiary, if they do not meet the standard. They would not confirm a NHK report that they plan a site inspection as early as later this week.If the certification is canceled, it could affect the company’s business as many global buyers require suppliers to have ISO9001 to do deals, Jun Yasumoto, technical manager at Lloyd’s Register in Japan, told Reuters.Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism plans to probe the safety of automobiles, trains and planes using Kobe Steel products, a ministry spokesman said on Thursday.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing plans to start using self-driving vehicles to pick up passengers in a district of Shanghai city and hopes to expand the scheme outside China by 2021.The service will allow passengers who hail a vehicle in the city’s Jiading district via Didi’s app to choose to be picked up by a self-driving car, the firm’s Chief Technology Officer Zhang Bo said at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference.The cars will still be staffed with a human driver, he said, adding that more than 30 different types of car models will be offered in the pilot service, all equipped with so-called Level-4 autonomous driving capabilities.All self-driving rides will be free of charge.Zhang told reporters on Friday that Didi intends to go live with the service in a matter of months, but that it was waiting for some licences. The firm won permits from the Shanghai government to test its self-driving fleet on Wednesday.Didi hopes to have the so-called robotaxis in three Chinese cities, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, by 2020 and intends to launch outside the country by the year after, he said.Didi is also in talks with Toyota Motor Corp, with which it set up a joint venture last month focused on mobility services, on self-driving technology, he said.He added that he believed transportation technology providers will form a set of “alliances�� that provide a combination of a ridesharing network and an ability to make cars.“There will be no more than 3 alliances that can provide a real product,�� he said. “Self-driving vehicles will be one of the most important areas in artificial intelligence over the next ten years.”Earlier this month, Didi said it had spun-off its autonomous driving unit into an independent company that will focus on research and look to deepen collaboration with automakers, with Zhang as its CEO.Tech giants such as China’s Baidu Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Waymo as well as traditional carmakers have been racing to put full commercial self-driving vehicles on the road.However, some have stumbled due to the difficulty and expense of developing self-driving cars capable of anticipating and responding to humans in urban areas.In December, Waymo began charging passengers to use its driverless vehicles in a roughly 160 km (99.42 miles) zone in four U.S. suburbs, putting it ahead of U.S. rivals.	2.954910817
TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Canada’s transport ministry said it had found a potential seat-related defect in one of Toyota Motor Corp’s popular models after a fatal crash that led to a global recall of nearly 3 million vehicles by the world’s top-selling automaker.In a statement on Thursday, Transport Canada said it had discovered that in a severe front-impact crash, rear seatbelts could sever after coming in contact with steel parts from seat frames, failing to restrain passengers.The ministry said it made the discovery after reconstructing a crash involving a 2011 RAV4 in Canada in which the front occupants survived, but the rear passengers did not.Toyota said it was aware of the finding, along with a separate report from the U.S. market in which a rear seat passenger sustained injuries due to a severed seatbelt following a crash, while adding that it had not been able to confirm a connection with injuries or fatalities.The automaker earlier announced that it was recalling 2.87 million vehicles, including 1.3 million RAV4s in North America, along with around 625,000 vehicles in Europe, 434,000 vehicles in China, and 307,000 in other regions.Toyota also recalled 177,000 vehicles in Japan, including RAV4s and its Vanguard SUV model for the domestic market. It said it would add resin covers to the metal seat cushion frames of recalled vehicles.The RAV4 is one of Toyota’s top-selling models in North America, and was the No. 8 best-selling vehicle in the United States in 2015, according to Autodata.

Crafton hangs on for Truck Series win at DoverBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeDOVER, Del. -- It took 16 tries, but Matt Crafton got his first NASCAR Camping World Truck Series victory at Dover International Speedway.Holding off hard-charging Daniel Suarez throughout a 27-lap green-flag run to the finish of Friday’s Dover 200 at the Monster Mile, the two-time series champion picked up his first win of the season and the 12th of his career, all but assuring himself a berth in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Chase.“We’ve gotten close and we’ve had very fast trucks -- and this truck was very, very good today,�� said Crafton, who has all 12 of his career wins in No. 88 trucks fielded by ThorSport Racing. “It’s all about the guys behind me.“This team never gives up because we weren’t very good in the last practice. We were 21st. Junior (Joiner, crew chief) and I sat down and talked for a while -- and we talked again. I just showed up later and let him do his work. They worked on it all day -- a little air pressure here and a little air pressure there and finally this thing was right on.”And “right on�� was good enough to keep Suarez at bay in the closing laps.“It’s awesome,�� Crafton said. “I’ve always wanted Miles (the Monster trophy).”Suarez came home second in the No. 51 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota, matching his career best. Christopher Bell ran third, followed by Johnny Sauter and Cole Custer, who overcame an early penalty for jumping the first restart of the race on lap 49 of 200 to finish fifth.Suarez thought he had the fastest truck during the closing run but couldn’t get to Crafton’s bumper.“When I was moving to the top, I thought I was making some ground, but the slow cars were on the top, so it was difficult for me to keep the momentum and stay there,�� Suarez said. “I don’t know what I could have done different to try to complete the pass.“But what I think was that the 51 truck was the fastest out there at the end of that run, but clean air is super important here, and that paid off really good for the 88 team.”Though Michael Waltrip referred to Joiner as a “mastermind�� on the FOX Sports television broadcast, Joiner was quick to deflect credit to his driver.“We do it together, and we’re both masterminds at what we do, because we never stop,�� Joiner said. “That’s what makes us a unit. We don’t ever, ever stop. He’ll text me or call me at midnight if he woke up and had an epiphany or something. The good thing is we’ll both take it in and do it together.”NOTES: Pole-sitter William Byron, last week’s winner at Kansas, led a race-high 80 laps but faded to 11th at the finish. Crafton was close behind, leading 76 laps. ... Friday was a mixed bag for ThorSport, which had two trucks, driven by Ben Rhodes and Rico Abreu, wreck together on Lap 61. ... Crafton took over the series lead by two points over Timothy Peters, who finished 14th. ... In post-race inspection, Suarez’s No. 51 Toyota was found to be too low in the left rear. If any penalties are warranted, they will be announced next week.	0.862924023
TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp posted a 14.4% rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday, boosted by a rise in global vehicle sales.Japan’s biggest automaker posted an operating profit of 662.3 billion yen ($6.09 billion) in the July-September quarter, up from 579.1 billion yen a year ago.It was higher than an average forecast of 592.3 billion yen based on estimates from nine analysts, Refinitiv data shows.Toyota maintained its forecast for annual operating profit of 2.4 trillion yen, down slightly from 2.47 trillion yen last year, although it now expects the yen to trade at 107 yen to the U.S. dollar, versus a previous forecast of 106 yen.

(Reuters) - Self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation Inc said on Thursday it would buy Montana-based Blackmore, a company that develops a detection system known as lidar, used in self-driving technology.Aurora is among dozens of automakers and large technology companies working on self-driving car systems, and has partnerships with Byton, Hyundai Motor Co and Volkswagen to develop and test self-driving systems.With the notable exception of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc , most automakers have said their self-driving cars will rely on lidar.The technology uses laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car and is currently used by companies including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Alphabet Inc’s Waymo.“Lidar is critical for developing the safest and most reliable self-driving system, one that can navigate our roads more safely than a human driver,�� said Aurora’s Chief Executive Officer Chris Urmson, who earlier led Alphabet’s self-driving program.Toyota Motor Corp has partnered with several lidar startups, including Blackmore and Luminar, but the Japanese automaker continues to evaluate new sensing technologies.Last week, Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it would, for now, stick to self-driving technology which uses radar sensors and cameras, avoiding lidar because of their high cost and limited capabilities.	5.263601856
EditorsNote: adds quotes, details, agateCrafton wins shortened Kentucky truck raceBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeSPARTA, Ky. -- In a race that ended five laps short of its scheduled distance, polesitter Matt Crafton was declared the winner of Thursday night’s UNOH 225 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series event after Ben Kennedy’s Toyota damaged the catchfence at Kentucky Speedway beyond the track’s capacity to repair it expeditiously.With a shove from the Ford of Ryan Blaney, Crafton had taken the lead from eventual runner-up Erik Jones on Lap 145 moments before Kennedy was launched into the fence from contact with David Gilliland’s Ford.The victory was the fourth of the season for the two-time defending series champion, who won for the first time at Kentucky and the eighth time in his career.“I’ve got to thank Ryan Blaney--he was all about that restart,�� Crafton said in Victory Lane. “I know we had the best truck here when we got track position. When we got track position earlier, we’d drive away from everybody.”But Crafton, who led 44 laps, lost the top spot during a pit stop on Lap 100, when he had to wait for John Wes Townley to clear to his inside before he could enter his pit stall.“I think that was the only reason we lost the lead,�� Crafton said. “But this Toyota Tundra was really, really good.”The race was slowed for the seventh time on Lap 140, when contact from the No. 05 Chevrolet of John Wes Townley sent the No. 23 Silverado of Spencer Gallagher hard into the outside wall.NASCAR red-flagged the proceedings for 3 minutes, 28 seconds for track clean-up, leaving Jones in the lead for a restart on Lap 145.But Gallagher’s wreck was nothing compared with the jolt Kennedy took on the restart lap after contact with Gilliland’s Ford sent Kennedy’s Toyota to the top of the SAFER barrier and into the catch fence.“I thought I was clear,�� Kennedy said on his radio. The driver of the No. 11 Tundra had moved up the track into Gilliland’s Ford after being cleared by his spotter.“I heard ‘Clear�� on the radio, so I moved up to the wall and as soon as I went to the wall,�� Kennedy said after leaving the infield care center. “I guess Gilliland had a run on the outside and pretty much hit me in the right rear -- and I went up.“I guess I was on top of the wall. I remember being on top of the wall for quite some time. I didn’t see much -- just a bunch of dust and debris flying. Then came down. The ride from the wall to the ground was pretty hard. But I’m OK.“Thank God for everything that NASCAR has done to keep this sport safe. ‘Cause for me to get out of my car on my own power after a hit like that is pretty incredible.”Blaney finished third, followed by Daniel Suarez and Timothy Peters.Two support poles in the catchfence had to be replaced, a process that would consume 90 minutes. Accordingly, NASCAR called the race with five laps left.It was the second straight race in one of NASCAR’s top three touring series in which a car has hit the fence protecting the grandstands. In last Sunday’s Coke Zero 400 Sprint Cup Series at Daytona International Speedway, Austin Dillon’s Chevrolet was launched into the fence during a last-lap wreck in the tri-oval.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- UNOH 225Kentucky SpeedwaySparta, KentuckyThursday, July 09, 20151.

(Reuters) - A San Francisco window washer fell 11 stories from a high-rise building on Friday, landing atop a moving car on the street below, and was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries, police said.The worker, who was not immediately identified, plummeted from the office building in the city’s financial district at about 10 a.m., landing on a Toyota Camry, San Francisco Police officer Albie Esparza said.Esparza said the victim was rushed to San Francisco General Hospital and was in surgery at last report.The Camry’s sole occupant was shaken up emotionally but not injured, while the car was badly damaged, Esparza said.He said the incident would be investigated by California occupational safety officials as an industrial accident.	4.264778528
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s sales in China grew 13.2 percent in August from a year earlier while smaller rival Honda’s sales jumped over a fifth for the month, keeping intact a trend of Honda outselling Toyota in the world’s biggest auto market.Toyota, Japan’s No. 1 automaker by volume, sold 108,500 vehicles in August, the company reported on Monday. The jump followed an 11.4 percent increase it posted in July.Its January-August sales totaled about 841,400 vehicles, a 7.1 percent increase from the same period a year ago.Toyota is on target to sell more than 1.21 million vehicles this year in China compared to the 1.2 million vehicles it sold in 2016, said a Toyota spokesman in Beijing. He said Toyota plans in part to leverage the relative popularity of compact Corolla and Levin cars.Honda Motor Co sold 128,671 vehicles in August, up 20.6 percent, following an 11.6 percent increase in July, the company reported on Monday.Honda’s January-August sales volume totaled 886,641 vehicles, an 18.0 percent increase from the same period a year ago.Since making a full market entry in China in the late 1990s, except for early years Toyota had generally outsold Honda in China every month and year until last year. Honda has turned the tide, thanks to hot-selling models that include the redesigned Civic and a couple of subcompact crossover SUVs.	6.35451505
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An automotive trade group said on Tuesday it would tell the Trump administration that a U.S. threat to impose a tariff of up to 25 percent on imported passenger vehicles under national security grounds would cost American consumers $45 billion annually, or $5,800 per vehicle.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and other major automakers, will file written comments with the U.S. Commerce Department later this week, spokeswoman Gloria Bergquist said.“Nationwide, this tariff would hit American consumers with a tax of nearly $45 billion, based on 2017 auto sales. This would largely cancel out the benefits of the tax cuts,�� Bergquist said, previewing the comments. Consumers would also face higher costs of imported auto parts when buying vehicles from both U.S. and foreign automakers, she said.	5.782393203
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp unveiled an emergency safety system on Monday that uses big data to ignore the accelerator if it determines the driver steps on the pedal unintentionally.Japan’s biggest car maker will roll out what it calls an “accelerator suppression function�� in new cars from this summer, beginning in Japan.The system is a response to an increasingly common cause of traffic accident in ageing Japan where the driver, often elderly, mistakes the accelerator for the brake.Some 15% of fatal accidents on Japanese roads in 2018 were caused by drivers who were 75 years or older, showed a report from the government, which actively encourages elderly drivers to give up their licenses.Toyota’s announcement comes as automakers globally invest heavily in so-called active safety features as they work to develop fully autonomous cars.It also comes in the same year Toyota will act as exclusive mobility sponsor for the Tokyo Olympics, where it will showcase its fully self-driving e-Palette transportation pods carrying athletes around the Olympic village at low speeds.Among competitors, Honda Motor Co Ltd plans to launch a car this year capable of full autonomy in highway traffic jam situations. Nissan Motor Co Ltd released the second generation of its ProPilot driver-assist system last spring, offering hands-free operation for single-lane highway driving.Toyota rolled out its first-generation Safety Sense package in 2015, which included automated emergency braking and a lane departure alert. The second generation became available in 2018, adding assisted single-lane highway driving and making the car capable of recognizing pedestrians at nighttime and bicycles.Its new feature was developed using data collected from the internet-connected cars it has on the road. Unlike the car maker’s existing safety options, the new system does not require the presence of an obstacle to function.	-5.089260006
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to invest $2 billion to develop electric vehicles (EVs) in Indonesia over the next four years, starting with hybrid vehicles, Indonesia’s coordinating ministry for maritime affairs said.“From 2019 to 2023, we will progressively increase our investment to 28.3 trillion rupiah ($2 billion),�� Toyota president Akio Toyoda was quoted as saying in a statement released by the ministry on Thursday.The Japanese carmaker said this month that it aimed for half its global sales to be from electric vehicles by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, and will tap Chinese battery makers to meet the accelerated global shift to electric cars.The deal was agreed at a meeting in Osaka on Thursday between Indonesia’s Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan and Toyoda.“Because the Indonesian government already has an electric vehicle development map, Toyota considers Indonesia a prime EV investment destination,�� Toyoda said in the statement.He said Toyota would follow the government’s EV plan by investing in stages, starting with the development of hybrid vehicles.Monet, the self-driving car joint venture of Toyota and SoftBank Corp, separately told Reuters in June it plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia next year.Indonesia, the region’s largest economy, has plentiful reserves of nickel laterite ore, a vital ingredient in the lithium-ion batteries used to power EVs, and has been making a push to attract foreign carmakers.Officials are betting Indonesia, which is already Southeast Asia’s second-largest car production hub, can become a major regional player in lithium battery production and feed the fast-rising demand for EVs.The country announced earlier in 2019 plans to introduce a fiscal scheme that will offer tax cuts to EV battery producers and automakers, as well as preferential tariff agreements with other countries that have a high EV demand.Indonesian ministers told Reuters in December that Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co plans to start producing EVs in Indonesia as part of an around $880 million auto investment in the country.Japan’s Mitsubishi meanwhile announced in mid-2018 it would work with the Indonesian government to research infrastructure that could accommodate EVs.Analysts are cautious however on how quickly Indonesia’s EV ambitions can be carried out, as some of its lithium battery projects require complicated nickel smelter technology.The ministry’s statement on Thursday gave no details on how Toyota, which already makes batteries for hybrids and hybrid plug-ins, would implement its investment plans.Toyota was not immediately reachable for comment, but said in June it would partner with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) and EV maker BYD Co Ltd for battery procurement.	6.242438906
SYDNEY, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Australia’s government plans to order the recall of more than two million vehicles fitted with Takata Corp airbags that have been linked to deaths worldwide, the ABC reported on Wednesday.About 2.3 million vehicles will be subject to the compulsory recall and the airbags must be replaced within two years, the broadcaster added.Around 60 models are affected including those made by Toyota, Mazda, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, BMW, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and others, it said.About 2.7 million vehicles have already been subject to a voluntary recall, of which 1.7 million have had their defective airbags replaced, ABC reported.Last week, Takata Corp’s U.S. unit agreed to settle a probe by 44 state attorneys general into accusations it concealed a deadly safety defect with air bag inflators.In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata Corp sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly half of Japan’s companies have no immediate plans in place to help counter the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, although a third of those surveyed in a Reuters poll indicated they were looking to improve productivity to cushion the blow.The survey suggests a long path to recovery for Japan. The world’s third-largest economy is expected to shrink at its fastest pace in decades this fiscal year, with economic activity not seen returning to pre-pandemic levels for another 2-3 years, analysts have said.In the latest monthly corporate survey, 49% said they had no plans in place to cushion the hit to their sales and profits this summer. Among transport equipment makers, Japan’s key industry, the rate was higher at about 66%.However, 51% of the participants said they have plans to overcome the pandemic pain. About 60% of this group, or 30% of total, said improving productivity was their top pick for dealing with the hit to business.Reviewing business activity and planning new business were the second and third popular choices, though no transport equipment makers picked these.In written comments, many firms said cutting costs was the best way to respond to declining demand.“We are taking various steps, but none of them are expected to produce major effects near term,�� a chemicals maker manager wrote in the June 30-July 10 survey, conducted on condition of anonymity so respondents can express their opinions freely.Three fourth of the firms said their number of workers was unchanged from a year earlier, while two thirds of transport equipment makers said their staffing level was steady.The survey underscored the pain inflicted on the automobile sector, which significantly impacts many other industries.Some 44% of transportation equipment makers have furloughed up to half their employees, versus 14% of overall firms.Global car demand has plunged since March as virus-related lockdowns kept people indoors and prompted factories to close.While many countries have been reopening their economies, analysts say it could take up to five years for demand to recover to 2019 levels.One in five transport equipment makers expressed concern about capital shortage in the survey, double the ratio of overall firms who voiced such concerns.Sales in May by Japan's biggest automaker Toyota 7203.T fell 34% from a year ago, while Nissan 7201.T sales fell 37.3% and Honda 7267.T sales slipped 29%.Asked about business continuation plans, about 30% said they intend to either expand core business or find new ground, while 55% aim to restore business to pre-pandemic levels.For transport equipment firms, restoring business to pre-pandemic levels was the top choice, followed by reducing or reviewing their core business.The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Wednesday but warned uncertainty over the outlook was “extremely high�� due to risks such as a second wave of infections.Two in five firms in the survey said they were concerned about a return of deflation later this year, while 54% saw prices remaining flat. Just 6% expected prices to rise.On prices of their products and services, three quarters said they would keep them flat in the second half. Some 17% said they would cut, while 8% intend to lift prices.“We remain under strong pressure from clients to cut prices, but demand is so weak to begin with that price cuts won’t help boost sales,�� an industrial rubber maker manager wrote.A retail manager wrote: “As long as consumers�� incomes are on the decline, they will turn to cheap goods and services.”The survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research, canvassed 496 big and midsize non-financial firms, with some 230 of them answering questions on the impact of the virus.	7.146810025

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc has named director Robyn Denholm as board chair, fulfilling a demand by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to strip the job from Elon Musk, the electric car maker’s wayward chief executive who has dragged the company through months of turbulence.The appointment was required as part of a September deal Tesla struck with the securities regulator to settle fraud charges against Musk and Tesla. Legal experts said it was unclear if Denholm, who has been on Tesla’s board for four years, was independent enough for Tesla to comply with the court-approved settlement.Denholm, 55, joined Tesla as an independent director in 2014 and is the head of its audit committee. She was paid almost $5 million, mainly in stock options, by the company last year, making her the highest remunerated of its board members.She is finance chief at Australian telecoms firm Telstra Corp Ltd and previously worked for Toyota in Australia, according to her LinkedIn profile. She will resign from Telstra to take the Tesla role full-time.Whether she is independent enough to rein in public outbursts by Musk - who mocked the SEC as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission�� on Twitter after the fraud charge settlement - is an open question.Denholm sat on the board when Musk set production targets for the Model 3 car that were not met, and also when the chief executive tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, which prompted the SEC to file fraud charges against him.The court-approved settlement of those charges requires Tesla to certify in writing that it has appointed an “independent�� chairman and to provide evidence and exhibits to make its case.While the definition of “independent�� is typically broad, legal experts suggested the court could ultimately conclude Tesla was not in compliance with the letter of the settlement.“It does violate the spirit of the settlement, which was to change the culture of the board so there was a check on Musk’s worst instincts,�� said Stephen Diamond, a professor of corporate governance at Santa Clara University.The SEC declined to comment beyond the court judgment.Musk, who remains Tesla's biggest shareholder and the driving force behind its ambitious plans to reshape electric battery technology and car transport, tweeted here his approval of the appointment.“Musk, I believe, has a ton to do with the selection and he wants to be sure that they can see eye-to-eye,�� said Elazar Capital analyst Chaim Siegel.Top proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis &amp; Co had each classified Denholm as an “independent�� director of Tesla in reports to the carmaker’s investors earlier this year.Denholm pumped petrol at her parents�� filling station before going on to study at Sydney University and joining accounting firm Arthur Andersen.Since then, she has worked at Swiss power grid maker ABB Ltd, network gear firm Juniper Networks and computing firm Sun Microsystems. She has also been national manager of finance for Toyota Australia.Telstra CEO Andy Penn said when he appointed her: “Robyn has a proven track record as a global COO in a business focused on telecommunications networks.”Executive recruiter Patricia Lenkov, however, said that Denholm likely was not the right pick for the job, arguing Tesla needed a figure with more experience dealing with strong founders.“There might be an element of risk here. She’s not a proven entity in this kind of work,�� she said.While Tesla is finally starting to make good on Musk’s promises on production of the Model 3 sedan, seen as crucial to the company’s future, it has lost senior executives for sales, human resources, manufacturing and finance in recent months.Its vice president for manufacturing Gilbert Passin was reported last month to have left.“We view the fact that Denholm has prior industry experience with Toyota positively,�� said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson, adding it made sense that Tesla should seek to avoid the risk of a genuine outsider clashing with Musk.The Silicon Valley billionaire’s gift for self-promotion has made Tesla one of the world’s most talked-about businesses but also caused public spats with journalists, analysts, Wall Street investors and even rapper Azealia Banks.He is being sued for calling one of the divers behind this year’s Thai cave rescue a “pedo��.According to The Australian newspaper, Denholm said the only things that really disappoint her are rudeness and waste.“Politeness costs you absolutely nothing. It doesn’t matter whether you are the most senior person in the room, or the most junior,�� she told the paper in an interview a few years ago.Tesla shares closed up about 1 percent at $351.40.	3.111944752
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s vehicle sales in China rose 5.4 percent in March from a year earlier to about 118,500 vehicles, the company said on Wednesday.For the first three months of the year, sales volume totaled about 321,900 vehicles, up 8.7 percent from the same period a year ago.Toyota aims to sell 1.4 million vehicles in China in 2018, nearly 9 percent more than it sold last year. Toyota insiders have described the target as a stretch goal, in part because of production constraints and other hurdles.Toyota’s forecast for 2018 is relatively more upbeat than the previous few years, partly as it expects to launch later this year a couple of potentially high-volume subcompact sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) -- two China-market versions of the subcompact Toyota CH-R crossover SUV.The CH-R hit showrooms in the United States in April last year.	3.226059655
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Reuters) - A current and a former executive of Japan’s NGK Spark Plug Co Ltd were indicted on Thursday on charges of fixing the prices of spark plugs and oxygen sensors, the U.S. Justice Department said.Norio Teranishi, a former executive, and Hisashi Nakanishi, a current employee of NGK Spark Plug, were accused of conspiring to fix the prices of parts sold to DaimlerChrysler AG , Ford Motor Co, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd , which makes Subaru, General Motors Co, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp, the department said.The price fixing conspiracy ran from about 2000 to 2011, the department said.NGK Spark Plug pleaded guilty to the charges in October 2014 and agreed to pay a fine of $52 million.A total of 35 companies have pleaded guilty in the United States to bid rigging in the automotive parts industry. A total of 55 have been charged.The case at the U.S. District of Michigan and is United States v Norio Teranishi and Hisashi Nakanishi. It is Case No. 15-20306. (Reporting by Diane Bartz.

TOKYO, May 21 (Reuters) - The head of Japan’s auto lobby said on Thursday he hopes for an interim report on the cause of Takata Corp’s air bag problems by the end of the year from any one of the teams investigating the issue.More than 50 million cars have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata’s potentially deadly air bag inflators that can explode with too much force and spray metal shards inside the car. The figure includes the Japanese supplier’s move this week to double its U.S. recall to nearly 34 million vehicles, for investigative purposes and without a known cause.For the recalls that have been identified as a manufacturing problem at Takata’s factories, domestic automakers are likely expecting discussions for payment by the supplier in instalments, Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) Chairman Fumihiko Ike said.Ten automakers led by Toyota Motor Corp have set up a committee to investigate the root cause of other problematic inflators made by Takata, in addition to internal and third-party teams set up by the supplier and some automakers on their own.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T unveiled a completely redesigned hydrogen-powered fuel cell sedan on Friday in its latest attempt to revive demand for the niche technology that it hopes will become mainstream.Japan's biggest automaker has been developing fuel-cell vehicles for more than two decades, but the technology has been eclipsed by the rapid rise of rival battery-powered electric vehicles promoted by the likes of Tesla Inc TSLA.O.Ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show starting on Oct. 24, Toyota unveiled a prototype of the new hydrogen sedan built on the same platform as its luxury Lexus brand’s LS coupe. The new Mirai model boasts longer driving range than its predecessor and completely redesigned fuel cell stack and hydrogen tanks, the company said.“We wanted to make a car that people really want to buy, not just because it’s an eco car,�� Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the new Mirai, said at the unveiling.“We wanted something that’s fun to drive.”Its sporty redesign with longer wheelbase and lower-slung chassis is a marked departure from the first-generation Mirai, which looks like a bulked-up Prius hybrid.The new car also has a 30% improvement in driving range over the previous iteration’s approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles), according to the company.Tanaka said the latest Mirai would cost less to make than its predecessor, because of a shift to mass production. The current model is mostly assembled by hand.Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,500) after subsidies in Japan, the original Mirai is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T leases out the Clarity.Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. By contrast, Tesla sold 25,000 of battery-powered Model S sedans in its first year and a half.Toyota declined to disclose a price for the model and said it would be available from late next year in Japan, North America and Europe.	7.094868955

(Reuters) - McLaren Formula One driver Fernando Alonso can compete for Toyota in every round of the World Endurance Championship this season after organizers moved the Japanese event to avoid a U.S. Grand Prix clash.They announced at a presentation in Paris on Friday that the Six Hours of Fuji had been brought forward to Oct. 14, ensuring that the Spaniard can feature for Toyota at the manufacturer’s home track.Alonso wants to win the Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race in France as part of the “triple crown of motorsport�� achieved only by the late Briton Graham Hill.Hill, like Alonso a two-times Formula One world champion, won Le Mans, the Monaco Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500 in the 1960s and early 1970s.Toyota announced last month that Alonso, whose main focus remains Formula One, would be racing all the rounds of the endurance season that did not clash with his McLaren commitments.The Fuji race had originally been pushed back a week to Oct. 21 to avoid a clash with the IMSA Petit Le Mans round at Road Atlanta in the United States.The eight round 2018-19 WEC “super season�� includes two editions of Le Mans as a move towards a championship that will start in the European summer and end with the French endurance classic.The top LMP1 category will have 10 cars, with Toyota the only factory team following the departure of reigning champions Porsche.Alonso will share a car with Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi and Japanese Kazuki Nakajima, both former F1 drivers.	-6.068031133
LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - China Mengniu Dairy and Coca-Cola have signed a multi-year global Olympic deal as joint beverages and dairy sponsors starting from 2021 until 2032, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Monday.While some reports put a $3 billion price tag on the agreement, there were no financial details available and both Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey and Mengniu Chief Executive Jeffrey Lu refused to comment on the size of the deal.Coca-Cola’s previous deal ran to 2020 and the new agreement with China’s top milk products manufacturer, which will span six Olympic Games, makes it the longest Olympic sponsor, the U.S. drinks maker having first supported the Games in 1928.“It is a substantial arrangement. It is a profound partnership,�� said Quincey.“With Mengniu, we saw an opportunity to expand the dairy aspect of the beverage category.“We will be activating our own individual marketing plans, but we are pleased to be a joint partner with a well-respected dairy company that is well known to us in China.”The two companies are already working together in some aspects of their business in China.The announcement is a major boost for the IOC, strengthening its financial future as interest in the world’s biggest multi-sports event has waned in the last few years.Mengniu is the latest Asian company to join as top sponsors after Bridgestone, Toyota and Alibaba in recent years and reflects the region’s growing influence of global business.“This long-term agreement is another demonstration of the relevance and stability of the Olympic Games in these times of uncertainty,�� IOC President Thomas Bach said.His organization will later award the 2026 Winter Olympics to either Milan or Stockholm. Four other cities had pulled out of the bidding, fearful of the Games�� cost and size.Beijing will host the 2022 Olympics, while the Summer Games of 2024 will be staged in Paris. Los Angeles has been awarded the 2028 Olympics.Mengniu’s Lu said the agreement was a key part of their global vision.“This historic joint partnership deal, together with our global expansion plans, will help Mengniu promote our long-held values around quality and safety,�� Lu added.“This is a vital step in our international strategy, and we are honored to have the opportunity to build the positive reputation of Chinese food and beverage brands among consumers globally.��	6.579052809
TOYOTA, Japan (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will start selling in 2015 the first vehicles built under its parts-sharing and platform framework, the company said on Wednesday, as rivals led by Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE pursue similar strategies to cut costs.The framework, called the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), shares parts among vehicles using the same platform in order to save costs and manpower.Initially, vehicles will share 20-30 percent of parts, a ratio Toyota wants to eventually expand to 70-80 percent, Executive Vice President Mitsuhisa Kato said.“Global competition among automakers is becoming more severe, and TNGA is an effort to make more efficient and more attractive products,�� he told reporters.Volkswagen recently began implementing its MQB platform, and almost all of the group’s small and medium front-wheel-drive family models, including the VW Golf, are being designed around it.	12.00775946
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T regained the crown as the world's top selling automaker in 2012, posting record-high sales and beating rivals General Motors GM.N and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE.Toyota said on Monday it sold 9.75 million vehicles group-wide around the world last year, a record for the 75-year-old Japanese automaker and up 22.6 percent from a year ago.The result was in line with the company’s December forecast, and put it back in the No. 1 spot, which it lost in 2011 when it was hit by a wave of negative publicity after a recall crisis in the United States, and a disrupted supply chain following an earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand.Toyota held the global sales crown from 2008 through 2010, but fell to third place in 2011 behind GM and Volkswagen.GM sold 9.28 million vehicles in 2012, up 2.9 percent from a year ago, while Volkswagen sold 9.07 million vehicles, up 11.2 percent.Toyota aims to sell 9.91 million vehicles group-wide globally in 2013, up 1.6 percent from 2012.The Toyota group also includes sales at Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T and Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T.

PARIS (Reuters) - Peugeot-owner PSA and Renault are planning new safety measures in a push by France’s major industrial groups for a breakthrough with workers to reopen some factories before the government lifts its lockdown from mid-May, unions said.Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corp. 7203.T on Wednesday became the first auto company with a plant in France to agree with unions a gradual restart of production from April 21 at its factory in northern France, where it makes the Yaris model.The ramp-up comes as auto rivals elsewhere look to resume manufacturing from next week, including in Germany where some restrictions to contain the new coronavirus outbreak will be eased shortly.In France, negotiations with labour unions have been tough, however. PSA PEUP.PA and Renault RENA.PA told Reuters they were preparing for a restart of operations, but no date had officially been set yet.At PSA’s gearbox factory in Valenciennes, where a first plan to resume production on a voluntary basis was rejected by unions in March, management and workers�� representatives are to hold fresh talks on Friday.New safety protocols are being developed by the carmakers, union members said.These could include wearing masks, giving out individual ashtrays so that smokers do not gather in one area, and keeping the doors open to avoid contact with the handles.They would also entail disinfecting tools and work surfaces every 60 minutes and doubling the number of buses that pick up workers.The French government has encouraged companies to resume production, mindful of a major hit to the economy, already expected to contract 8% this year.“I believe that there is a way to do it: it is not about choosing either the resumption of activity, or the health of the employees, it is both at the same time, it is doable,�� French labour minister Muriel Penicaud told LCI radio on Thursday, citing Toyota as a potential model.Restrictions on movement in France will not be eased until at least May 11, starting with the reopening of some stores and schools.French train maker Alstom ALSO.PA told Reuters on Thursday it had been progressively ramping up its activities since the beginning of April at its plants in France.The hard-left CGT union, however, has said it still considers it premature for carmakers to resume production in late April or early May, arguing that masks are still reserved as a priority for the health workers and may not be available.The country’s metals lobby said on Sunday that French companies in the automotive, aerospace and steel sectors were ready to return to work and assure “impeccable, sanitary conditions��.Renault already restarted production in Portugal and Russia on Monday.	-4.124869593

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T is closing in on a deal to invest about $500 million in Grab as part of roughly $1 billion that Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing firm is seeking in its latest funding, sources with knowledge of the matter said.Six-year-old Grab has garnered more than $6 billion in total funding, led by SoftBank, Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. After its last funding a few months ago, Grab was valued at around $11 billion.SoftBank first bought a stake worth $250 million in Grab in 2014 and has invested more subsequently. A doubling down on Grab with new funding would underscore SoftBank’s confidence in the ride-hailing company’s aggressive expansion after it acquired Uber Technologies Inc’s Southeast Asian business this year.Singapore-headquartered Grab is looking to transform itself into a leading consumer technology group, offering services such as food and parcel deliveries, electronic money transfers, micro-loans and mobile payments, besides ride-hailing, in one of the world’s fastest growing markets - home to some 640 million people.“Grab is going into so many verticals to become the dominant platform play. SoftBank clearly sees it as the long-term winner in this huge market,�� said one source.SoftBank did not comment for the story when contacted by Reuters. Grab declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.The sources said SoftBank and Grab are in advanced talks to finalize terms of the latest investment and Grab’s latest funding round is likely to be completed in a few weeks. It was not clear which unit of SoftBank is making the investment.Grab is likely to tap strategic and financial firms for the remainder of the funding and this could be the final major funding before a potential IPO in a few years, the sources said.It has already raised $2 billion this year, led by Toyota and financial firms, to fuel its expansion that has now taken its ride-hailing business to 235 cities in eight countries in Southeast Asia.Ride hailing services in Southeast Asia are expected to surge to $20.1 billion in gross merchandise value in 2025 from an estimated $5.1 billion in 2017, according to a Google-Temasek report.Grab’s app has been downloaded more than 109 million times and it has clocked more than 2 billion rides so far.Within Southeast Asia, Indonesia - home to 250 million-plus people - is shaping up as a battleground for global technology giants such as Alibaba BABA.N, Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK, JD.com JD.O, Google and SoftBank in the fight for market share in ride-hailing, online payments and e-commerce.Grab has earmarked Indonesia as a priority market as competition heats up with Indonesian rival Go-Jek expanding into Southeast Asia.	-5.012345679
* Q1 net profit 2.45 trln won vs 2.07 trln forecast* Q1 operating profit 2.28 trln won; sales 20.16 trln won* Global auto demand to rise 5.6 pct this year - CFO* Hyundai shares up 1.75 pct in flat marketBy Hyunjoo JinSEOUL, April 26 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor bucked sluggish markets in Europe and China and boosted sales in the United States, driving quarterly net profit up by almost a third to $2.15 billion, its highest since changing accounting methods a year ago.The $54 billion South Korean carmaker, which with affiliate Kia Motors is the world’s fifth largest, said it expects to beat an aggressive sales target for Europe - of an increase of 15.4 percent to 465,000 vehicles this year - even though the market is seen falling 5 percent. Hyundai increased its European sales by 11 percent last year.The European car market slid 8 percent in the first quarter, but Hyundai posted double-digit sales growth helped by new models such as the revamped i30 compact. French automakers PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault this week reported falls of 7 percent and 8.6 percent respectively in first-quarter sales as the French market alone shrank by nearly a fifth.Shares in Hyundai have risen close to 13 percent this month, hitting a life high of 269,500 won ($240), while Japanese rivals Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Nissan Motor , as well as Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen have all fallen.January-March net profit at Hyundai jumped to 2.45 trillion won from 1.88 trillion won a year earlier, well ahead of a consensus forecast of 2.07 trillion won from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“There’s no reason why Hyundai can’t continue this upward trend in the second quarter. The U.S. market looks fine and although there are slowdown concerns in Europe and China. In China foreign brands like Hyundai are performing well,�� said Kim Dae-hwan, fund manager at Shinyoung Asset Management.Once derided for its poor quality, boxy cars, Hyundai, under Chairman Chung Mong-koo, has moved up the quality ladder and is envied by rivals for offering stylish models at affordable prices even during an industry downturn. Its operating margin of around 10.5 percent is more than four times that of Toyota.The maker of the Sonata sedan and Elantra compact has also benefited from a cheaper South Korean won and free trade deals with Europe and the United States.After a period of breakneck growth, Hyundai’s engine is slowing, but not stalling. Net profit is expected to grow 9 percent to a record 8.85 trillion won this year, though that pace of growth will be just a quarter of last year’s, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates.Hyundai’s sales in its home market skidded 7 percent in the first quarter. A year ago, domestic sales accounted for 16 percent of Hyundai’s total, and the captive market - where 8 out of every 10 cars is a Hyundai or a Kia - has helped fund the group’s overseas growth.On an earnings call, Hyundai’s chief financial officer Lee Won-hee said global demand for cars this year would increase by 5.6 percent - more than has generally been forecast - driven by the United States and China.“There are few risks for Hyundai’s strong growth momentum,�� said Kang Sun-sik, a fund manager at Woori Asset Management, which holds Hyundai stock. “Its overall sales remain strong globally thanks to improving brand and quality, the won is trading relatively cheap and its key rivals, especially Japanese, continue to struggle.“It will take a while for the Japanese to fully recover and, until then, Hyundai/Kia will probably be the best auto stocks with a promising earnings outlook.”Of 51 analysts covering Hyundai, 49 rate the stock a ‘buy�� or ��strong buy��.Hyundai increased its Chinese sales in January-March, in a market that shrank 1.3 percent, analysts have said. [I D :nL3E8FB1U9] The South Korean firm plans to start production at new plants in China and Brazil this year, after a new factory went into production in Russia last year, but it has capped its global production capacity at 7 million vehicles, saying it doesn’t want to follow Toyota, once its benchmark, which suffered from a major recall crisis after it ramped up global capacity.In the United States, Hyundai, Ford and others have also upgraded their 2012 sales goals after an unexpectedly strong first quarter as drivers finally put the 2008-09 downturn behind them and began replacing ageing gas guzzlers.Hyundai increased its U.S. sales by 15 percent in January-March, edging the overall market’s 14 percent gain, but its market share slipped to 4.7 percent from 5.1 percent as its stretched production capacity meant it couldn’t readily boost output.Hyundai shares rose 1.75 percent on Thursday in a flat broader market.	-5.841378468
SAO PAULO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Brazilian farm group Cantagalo General Grains SA (CGG) expects recent business deals and fresh capex financing to speed up the sale of its logistics unit Corredor Logística e Infraestrutura (CLI), a deal under negotiation for two years, two sources involved in the deal told Reuters.The sale of the unit, known as CLI, could raise up to $200 million and is pivotal to the group’s debt restructuring, one of the sources said. The estimate is based on the enterprise value of similar deals at Itaqui, the northern port where the unit operates a grain terminal as part of the “Tegram�� consortium.CGG, majority owned by Brazil’s Coteminas with a minority stake held by Japan’s Sojitz Corp, declined to comment.CLI signed long-term take-or-pay contracts ahead of the proposed sale, which helped it to increase cargo movement by 37% year-to-date at Itaqui, compared with 8% growth for the entire consortium, the second source said.CLI also obtained a $12 million bridge loan from U.S.-based Farallon Capital Management, with which it prepaid mandatory capital expenditure and eliminated near-term financing risks, the second person said.A third source said Farallon had extended the bridge loan, declining to elaborate.CLI’s sales process may also advance quicker after the government awarded Rumo Logística SA a license to explore a railway connecting Brazil’s farmlands in the south to Itaqui in the north, making CLI more appealing to buyers, the sources said last week.Prospective bidders for CLI include two Asian infrastructure funds, Rumo itself and logistics firm VLI, the sources said. VLI is partly owned by miner Vale SA.Rumo declined to comment. VLI did not respond to a request for comment.CLI operates in Itaqui as part of the “Tegram�� consortium comprising stakeholders Glencore, Brazil’s Amaggi, France’s Louis Dreyfus and Japan’s ZEN-NOH. Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and U.S.-based CHS Inc also operate there.The consortium runs four warehouses in Itaqui, each with 500,000 tonnes of grain capacity.The terminal’s expansion, costing 239 million reais ($69 million), involves the installation of new belts and a shiploader to double its overall annual capacity to 12 million tonnes of grains by 2020, according to Itaqui’s port authority.	3.242817788

(Repeats story to additional subscribers, with no changes to text)TOKYO, March 11 (Reuters) - For weeks, Olympic organisers have relentlessly pushed a consistent message: The Summer Games in Tokyo will not be cancelled or postponed.As recently as Thursday, Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto said “cancellation or delay of the Games would be unacceptable for the athletes.”But behind the scenes, sponsors who have pumped billions of dollars into the Games have grown increasingly nervous about how the coronavirus outbreak will impact the tournament.When organisers and sponsors met privately to discuss preparations last Wednesday, the companies learned there had been no decision on whether - or when - there would be any changes to the Games.“A lot of people are starting to worry, but there’s nothing much we can do,�� a representative of an Olympic sponsor, who was present at the previously unreported meeting, told Reuters.“If this continues into April, May, June, it will be an issue, but we’re still waiting to see what will happen,�� added the representative, who was not authorised to speak to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.The meetings between the Tokyo 2020 organising committee and “partner companies,�� including sponsors, take place regularly. There were dozens of people present at the one last week.“Nothing has been decided. On the inside, it’s a mess,�� said a person briefed on the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.The final decision belongs to the powerful International Olympic Committee chief, Thomas Bach. Companies such as Coca-Cola Co, Bridgestone Corp , Canon Inc , Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp sponsor the Games, and Japanese brands have for decades been some of the most generous.The IOC said on Wednesday that “the preparations for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 are continuing as planned.”Tokyo 2020 organising committee did not respond to a request for comment.The meeting last week brought into focus the scale of what organisers are grappling with: pressure to avoid a coronavirus crisis among 600,000 expected overseas spectators and athletes at an event that could see $3 billion in sponsorships and at least $12 billion spent on preparations evaporate.Haruyuki Takahashi, one of more than two dozen members of the board of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, told Reuters it has just started working on scenarios for how the virus could affect the Games. But a sponsor representative present at the meeting last week said those plans are not being shared with the companies.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has staked his legacy as the longest-serving Japanese leader on staging a successful Games and bringing a massive jolt, estimated at $2.3 billion, to the stagnant economy with tourism and consumer spending.Some Olympic qualifiers and test events have been relocated or delayed. The Games themselves don’t start until late July, leaving some time for the organisers to make the final call.Neal Pilson, the former head of CBS Sports, who was involved in broadcasting rights negotiations for three Winter Olympics said he expected organisers to assess the situation by early May at the latest, when they “will have a better fix on whether the epidemic is tapering down or continuing to expand.”Olympic Minister Hashimoto said the end of May was a possible time frame for a decision.Organisers have begun to modify their tone. At a news conference last week, Tokyo 2020 chief Yoshiro Mori vehemently denied that the Games would be cancelled, but added that planners were “listening to various opinions�� and responding “flexibly because the situation changes day by day.”�SERIOUSLY THREATENED’Last week, Hashimoto was questioned in parliament on the clause in the contract between the IOC and the organisers in Japan that determines when the Olympic committee could terminate the Games.One of the scenarios is the inability of the host city to hold the Olympics in 2020.The mention of the clause touched off speculation that the minister was hinting at a delay, which sponsors at last week’s meeting were told sparked the ire of the IOC.As a result, Hashimoto called senior members of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee to explain how she was “misunderstood.”According to the contract, the Tokyo metropolitan government, the Tokyo 2020 organising committee and the Japanese Olympic Committee signed away any right to indemnity, damages or compensation from the IOC.The contract says the IOC may scrap the Games when safety is “seriously threatened,�� among other reasons.Those three bodies have formed a task force on the virus that consults closely with the World Health Organization, which last week warned against “false hopes�� that the virus would disappear with warmer summer weather.Many sports in Japan, such as rugby and sumo, have held recent matches without spectators.Although keeping spectators away would cost estimated $800 million in lost ticket sales, it could still provide billions in revenue from broadcast and marketing rights.But experts said it would still be difficult to organise safe Games with thousands of athletes living in close proximity.“In the Olympic village alone, you’re bringing together 17,000-18,000 people, they’re living in close quarters, interacting with each other, coming from all over the world,�� said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College specialising in sports economics.A Tokyo 2020 official involved in the discussions on Olympics and the virus said that delaying the games until later in the year would be difficult.Takahashi, of the organising committee, said a one- or two-year delay would better accommodate professional sports schedules, which are planned years in advance.“We need to start preparing for any possibility. If the Games can’t be held in the summer, a delay of one or two years would be most feasible,�� Takahashi said.	-1.246029807
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T bucked the optimistic trend among Japanese carmakers reporting quarterly earnings, leaving its annual profit forecast unchanged as sluggish sales weighed on its bottom line while others got a boost from a weakening yen.The cheaper yen is improving the competitiveness of cars made by Nissan, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7203.T and other Japanese brands when exported to key markets such as the United States, and adding to pressure on their South Korean rivals.Shares in South Korea's biggest carmaker Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS have fallen around 20 percent since the start of October; by contrast, Toyota shares are up more than 50 percent.The revivifying effect of the falling yen is being felt throughout Japan's auto industry supply chain. Last week the world's second-biggest auto parts supplier Denso Corp 6902.T - part-owned by Toyota - raised its annual profit forecast by 6.7 percent, saying the currency move would help it and its customers.This week a South Korean finance ministry official warned of possible market intervention as the yen’s slump against the won - by more than 22 percent last year and another 5.6 percent so far this year - was cutting into South Korea’s export competitiveness.Adding to the discomfort for the South Korean industry, in January Toyota’s Camry model won the “Korea Car of the Year Award��, industry press reported, bagging a prize usually handed to domestically made vehicles.Among Japan's carmakers, currency moves are expected to have the most dramatic impact at Japan's fifth-ranked firm Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, which raised its operating profit outlook for the year ending in March by 80 percent.Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T, which makes Subaru cars, lifted its operating profit outlook by 30 percent, Toyota by 10 percent, and Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Daihatsu Motor Corp 7262.T by 8 percent apiece.Nissan left its annual net profit forecast unchanged at 320 billion yen ($3.43 billion) and reported a 35 percent year-on-year drop in third quarter net profit, citing weak demand in Europe, China and the United States.“Everyone faces the same yen moves, but for Nissan, there are regions in which it is selling below its target,�� said J.P. Morgan analyst Kohei Takahashi, referring to Japan and the United States.“It has been running with aggressive targets for all markets. For the past year or two, that worked out. But now the company is entering a cycle in which it is underperforming its target,�� he said.Nissan sold 4.94 million vehicles in calendar year 2012 globally, up 5.8 percent from 2011, but sales in China, its biggest market, fell 31.3 percent on average in October-December from a year ago after anti-Japan protests broke out in September in response to a dispute between the countries over the ownership of islands.“Looking forward, we have important vehicle launches,�� Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said in a statement. “We anticipate further yen correction. We have made swift organizational changes to help stimulate our business performance. And we remain confident that we will meet our full-year outlook.”In the United States, although its redesigned Altima sedan is selling well, Nissan is struggling to shift its older models such as the Rogue crossover SUV. The firm is expected to launch a redesigned Rogue, and in China a new-look Teana sedan, later this year.Shares in Nissan have risen about 45 percent since mid-November on hopes the weakening yen will boost its bottom line, far ahead of the 30 percent rise in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index .N225 over the same period.Toyota, Honda and Mazda have also posted big gains.The Japanese currency has lost around 20 percent of its value versus the dollar since October, which helps exporters because they can convert profits made overseas back into yen at a more favorable rate.	-1.642594166
DETROIT, April 26 (Reuters) - Subaru of America is recalling about 10,000 Forester sport-utility vehicles to replace improperly made carpet floor mats that may curl up in the heat and interfere with the clutch, brake and accelerator pedals.The 2014 Forester vehicles were built during the first three months of 2013. The resin composition used for the floor mat backing was not made properly, causing the mats to curl up when exposed to heat, Subaru said in a filing with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The automaker said it would replace all four floor mats in each of the 10,137 vehicles recalled. The problems could lead to a crash if the mats affected the clutch, brake or accelerator pedals, Subaru said in its filing.In 2009, Toyota Motor Corp recalled nearly 3.8 million vehicles because the floor mats could be trapped under the accelerator pedal. The automaker has since expanded that recall to add more Lexus and Toyota models.Subaru is a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.	5.697614553
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales for September looked set to jump about 13 percent from a year ago, beating analyst estimates because of cheap financing, stronger consumer sentiment and rebounding sales from foreign automakers including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.The annual auto sales pace for September is on track to reach 14.8 million vehicles, Morgan Stanley analysts said, higher than the 14.5 million rate estimated by analysts.Toyota sales chief Bob Carter said September’s auto sales rate would hit 14.9 million, the industry’s best level since March 2008.Automakers are offering zero percent financing on some models, and credit is more accessible to subprime, or less-qualified, borrowers. About 80 percent of new vehicle transactions are financed, said R.L. Polk analyst Tom Libby.“The money is so cheap now,�� said Jesse Toprak, TrueCar.com analyst. “Higher resale values and cheap money has been enabling automakers to offer some of the most attractive leasing programs we’ve seen in years.”The interest rate on a 48-month new car loan was about 3.19 percent last month, down from 4.39 percent in September 2011 and 7.45 percent in May 2009, according to Bankrate.com.Cheaper loans coupled with improving consumer sentiment have boosted auto sales, particularly since the second quarter. Both General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N pointed to signs that home prices and housing starts were improving.Auto sales also continue to benefit from Americans�� growing need to replace aging cars and trucks, which are pushing past the point of repair.“I think in general with the economy chugging along at about 1.5 percent to 2 percent that we are gradually seeing people come back,�� said Ford chief economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick.GM sold 210,245 cars and trucks last month, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier. Ford sold 174,976 cars and trucks last month, on par with its results from a year ago.Toyota said vehicle sales rose 41.5 percent to 171,190 last month, while Honda Motor Co 7267.T sales rose about 31 percent to 117,211.GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said sales of its mini, small and compact cars nearly doubled last month. Ford’s small car sales rose about 73 percent, while fuel prices rose.But both automakers said pickup truck sales in September, when those sales typically strengthen, were softer than in years past. Both GM and Ford said trucks made up about 12 percent of sales last month, down from 13 percent in September 2011.“There has been a fundamental shift of truck to car that we’ve been seeing for the past few years,�� said Chevrolet’s sales chief, Don Johnson, adding that September’s results represented a continuation of that trend.“Consumers, because of the price of fuel, have definitely shifted over the last couple of years to a stronger mix on the car side,�� he said.Ford shares were down 1.8 percent at $9.75 and GM shares were up 2.3 percent at $23.63 in late afternoon trading on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.The outsized gains from Toyota and Honda reflect their recovery from inventory shortages last year after the March 2011 earthquake in Japan.Chrysler Group LLC, the smallest U.S. automaker, showed a 12 percent jump in sales to 142,041. Volkswagen of America, the U.S. arm of Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, sales rose 34.4 percent.Nissan Motor Co's 7201.T sales fell 1.1 percent to 91,907 vehicles, hurt by higher fuel prices as well as inventory shortages of its Altima midsize sedan, said Al Castignetti, U.S. sales chief for the Nissan brand.Chrysler, majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA FIA.MI, projected that the sales rate would be 14.9 million for last month, including medium and heavy trucks.Typically, medium and heavy trucks add around 300,000 vehicles to the sales rate, suggesting a 14.6 million pace for light vehicles for September.Sales of the company’s new Dodge Dart, introduced earlier this year, continue to rise. Chrysler said it sold 5,235 Darts in September, a 72 percent jump from August.	0.9210014269

Dillon wins Firecracker 250 at DaytonaBy Jeff OlsonNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Austin Dillon led just nine laps Saturday night, including the one that mattered most.Dillon, grandson of legendary team owner Richard Childress, outlasted Elliott Sadler and Chase Elliott during a green-white-checkered finish to claim the crash-filled Firecracker 250, the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Daytona International Speedway.“This is Daytona, man,�� Dillon said during the post-race celebration. “There are so many family memories here. ... I’m just happy for my grandfather. He told me once when we were here in Victory Lane with Dale Earnhardt that you’ll have this opportunity one day. It means so much to be here.”A multi-car crash on Lap 96 of the 100-lap race took out Brian Scott, who led 84 laps and was in front when the wreck started. Scott moved to the outside line to block Elliott Sadler but was spun out, collecting several cars. Dillon slipped through the crash, then stayed ahead of Elliott after the final restart.Sadler recovered from the crash and surged past Elliott as the field reached the checkered flag to finish second. Afterward, he blamed Scott for the crash.“Either Brian’s spotter or Brian tried to make the move too late to block us,�� Sadler said. “We were already up to his right rear door. It wrecked us, man. This is Daytona. It’s a shame. We had a car good enough to win.”Scott acknowledged that the move was aggressive and poorly timed but said he thought Sader could have given him room.“I told myself I was going to be aggressive, and I was going for the win,�� Scott said. “I was trying to time that run. I knew the outside lane was coming. Obviously, I mistimed it a little bit, but I still felt like I gave them room to split me and go high. Instead of going high on me, he turned me into the wall.”Dillon posted his third Xfinity Series win of 2015 and fifth of his career, putting a smile on his grandfather’s face.“It’s cool any time you win here at Daytona,�� Childress said.A 12-car pile-up with 10 laps to go collected the top two in the Xfinity points standings -- Chris Buescher and Ty Dillon -- and set the stage for a restart with five laps remaining. Scott restarted ahead of Sadler and Austin Dillon.Sadler fell behind in the outside line but regained momentum and appeared to be ready to pass Scott, who was leading the inside line. Scott moved up to get in front of Sadler but didn’t have enough room and was turned into the wall.The crash left only nine cars on the lead lap. Dillon restarted ahead of Dakoda Armstrong and Elliott for the green-white-checkered finish, and Elliott quickly moved into second on the low line. He finished third, followed by Kasey Kahne, Benny Gordon and Armstrong.NASCAR XFINITY Series Race - Subway Firecracker 250Daytona International SpeedwayDaytona Beach, FloridaSaturday, July 04, 20151.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T flagged its smallest annual profit in four years for 2016/17 as the Japanese automaker braces for the impact from a strengthening yen amid slowing demand for some of its car models in the key North American market.The world’s biggest automaker by market value cut its full-year operating profit forecast on Thursday to 1.6 trillion yen ($15.78 billion), expecting it to fall 44 percent from a year ago to its lowest since 2013.Toyota trimmed its forecast from the 1.7 trillion yen given in May, as it revised its budgeted yen rate to 102 versus the U.S. dollar and 113 against the euro from previous forecasts of 105 yen and 120 yen, respectively. It promised steeper cuts to labor costs and tighter control over expenses to offset the worsening currency impact.A strong yen hurts Toyota and its smaller domestic rivals including Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T as cars exported from Japan become more expensive, while it also decreases the value of earnings made overseas. A weak yen in the prior three years had led to a period of record annual profits at Toyota.The company expects currency moves to eat into this year’s operating profit by a whopping 1.12 trillion yen.“The biggest change to our forecast is that we are now budgeting for the yen to trade around 100 to the U.S. dollar and the euro to trade around 110 from July,�� managing officer Tetsuya Otake told a results briefing.Toyota produces roughly 40 percent of its vehicles in Japan, much more than its domestic competitors. It exported nearly half of its domestic production in the first six months of 2016, during which the U.S. dollar tumbled nearly 16 percent against the yen.Takaki Nakanishi, CEO at Nakanishi Research Institute, said that Toyota was taking a proactive approach to managing the currency impact and that other automakers may follow suit by revising their rates later in the year.For the April-June quarter, an appreciating yen pushed operating profit down 15 percent to 642 billion yen. That beat an average estimate of 493.5 billion yen from 11 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.Toyota’s global vehicle sales rose during the first quarter on higher sales in Japan, Europe and Asia.But sales fell in North America, where U.S. demand for the Prius has been sluggish since it went on sale there earlier this year, as low gasoline prices have stoked demand for gas-guzzling SUVs and pick-up trucks.Toyota said it planned to produce an additional 30,000 SUVs and larger vehicles, including its popular RAV4 crossover model, in the United States, in the fiscal year to take advantage of the shift in consumer preference that has hurt demand for models like the Prius and the Camry sedan.The automaker said a roughly two-week production halt at virtually all of its assembly plants following a strong earthquake in April had cost about 70 billion yen due to lost production of 60,000 vehicles. Toyota said it expected to make up for that lost production by the end of March.Toyota, which ceded ground to Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE as the world's top selling car maker in the first half of 2016, kept its forecast for 2016/17 retail vehicle sales unchanged at 10.15 million units.	7.443682664
"OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian Parliament rushed through ratification of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade pact on Friday before taking a three-week break to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, a top government official said.Canada was the last of the three signatories to formally adopt the pact, prompting congratulations from the United States and Mexico.The House of Commons lower chamber, which had weeks of deliberations left, agreed the instant approval on Friday after opposition legislators dropped their objections. The upper Senate chamber backed the pact later in the day, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters.��(This) was entirely within the power of Canadian legislators to do, something we were able to do to help the Canadian economy at this challenging time, and I would like to thank legislators from all parties,�� she said.The only remaining step is formal approval by the governor-general - the representative of Queen Elizabeth, Canada’s head of state - which is a formality.The USMCA was designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which President Donald Trump strongly opposed on the grounds it had cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs.“Now that the USMCA has been approved by all three countries, an historic new chapter for North American trade has begun,�� U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.In a letter to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, Lighthizer sent notice of an entry-into-force date of June 1 for USMCA, according to a spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees tax and trade issues.Groups representing U.S. and foreign automakers -- including General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE -- as well as auto dealers and suppliers -- said they were ""gravely concerned"" by the June 1 date, including the new automotive rules of origin.“We are in the midst of a global pandemic that is significantly disrupting our supply chains, and the industry is throwing all available resources into managing production through this crisis,�� the groups said in the letter, adding that none of the three nations have drafted uniform automotive rules-of-origin regulations.Automakers, they said, also need time “to solicit the necessary information throughout the supply-chain to certify that our cars and trucks qualify under USMCA.”Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the approval was good news for Mexico at a time of economic and financial instability."	11.76036866
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - World champion Sebastien Ogier won the Rally of Mexico on Sunday and added five bonus Power Stage points for a maximum score that sent the Frenchman up to second in the overall standings.After three rounds of the season, the six-times world champion Citroen driver has won two and now trails Toyota’s Estonian Ott Tanak by four points.Tanak has 65 points, Ogier 61 and Hyundai’s Belgian Thierry Neuville 55. Toyota stayed on top in the manufacturer’s championship.The victory near the host city of Leon, in the central state of Guanajuato, was Ogier’s fifth in Mexico as he finished 30.2 seconds clear of Tanak.Britain’s Elfyn Evans had started the day second but ended up third for M-Sport Ford after Tanak overhauled him with two morning stage wins.Ogier had led since Friday and stayed ahead on the high-altitude dirt roads all the way to the finish.He beat Kris Meeke by 0.025sec in the final Power Stage to take 30 points from the weekend. Neuville took three bonus points.The next rally is in Corsica on March 28-31.	2.560228322
TOKYO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s sales in China last month halved from levels in August as anti-Japanese sentiment took its toll, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Friday, citing the Japanese automaker.Showroom traffic and sales have plunged at Japanese automakers since violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September over Japan’s purchase of a pair of disputed islands in the East China Sea.Toyota sold about 75,300 cars in China in August.A Toyota spokeswoman in Tokyo declined immediate comment on the report.	4.697554698

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday it is expanding a probe into potentially defective air bags to 12.3 million vehicles.The agency said the air bags were installed in some vehicles from model year 2010 through 2019 sold by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp, Mitsubishi and Toyota Motor Corp. They were equipped with an air bag control unit initially produced by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen. The agency said they could fail during a crash event. The agency, which first opened a probe in 2018, has reports of two crashes and two injuries related to the defect along with one death in a Toyota.	-3.523763021
LE MANS, France (Reuters) - Defending champions and overwhelming favorites Toyota were running first and second after an untroubled opening three hours of the 24 Hours of Le Mans sportscar race on Saturday.The number seven TS050 hybrid car shared by Britain’s Mike Conway, Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi and Argentine Jose Maria Lopez was more than a minute clear of the team’s number eight car after leading the field away from pole position.The number three Rebellion Racing entry, with Frenchmen Thomas Laurent and Nathanael Berthon as well as American Gustavo Menezes, was in third place in late afternoon sunshine with a threat of rain.“Just trying to make everything clean, not to do anything silly,�� said Conway after completing the opening stint and handing over to Kobayashi.“I thought the sister car would be a little bit closer. It looks like they’re struggling a little bit. Just try and focus on our car, do what we do.”The eight car crew of double Formula One champion Fernando Alonso, Japan’s Kazuki Nakajima and Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi won last year and are looking to clinch the World Endurance Championship (WEC) title.Either way, Sunday’s finish at the famed Sarthe circuit will see a Japanese driver win a major FIA-sanctioned world championship for the first time.Alonso, who left Formula One at the end of 2018 and can become the first F1 champion to win more than once at Le Mans, took over from Buemi after the two-hour mark.Toyota are the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category and the championship battle, at the end of a super-season that includes two editions of Le Mans, is a private one between their drivers.The Japanese car giant has already clinched the manufacturers�� championship and is sure to take the double with the number eight car out of reach of all but their team mates in car seven.The ceremonial starting flag for the 87th edition of the race, with 61 cars taking part, was waved by Princess Charlene of Monaco.	3.575742933

TOKYO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor’s Lexus will launch its first all-battery electric vehicle next year, as the luxury brand races to market a battery-operated car amid growing competition to develop zero-emissions vehicles, the head of the brand said on Wednesday.At the unveiling of a concept model of a futuristic EV hatchback ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show, he added that the goal is for sales of Lexus electric vehicles, including battery electrics and gasoline hybrids, to outpace sales of the luxury brand’s gasoline vehicle models by 2025.The Lexus model will be Toyota’s first full-sized, battery operated passenger car as the Japanese automaker catches up with rivals, including Nissan Motor Co and Tesla Inc , which have marketed battery EVs for years.“Initially, we will release products in China, North America, and other regions where demand for ‘pure�� EVs is high,�� Lexus International President Yoshihiro Sawa told reporters, adding that the brand would announce details for the upcoming model next month.Global automakers are expanding their vehicle offerings to include more electrified models to comply with tightening global emissions regulations, but demand for more environmentally friendly cars has been growing slowly due to their high price.

UTSUNOMIYA, Japan (Reuters) - At a two-day gathering for Honda’s suppliers in March, Chief Executive Takahiro Hachigo sounded the alarm.At the Hotel Higashinihon in Utsunomiya, Hachigo told them the Japanese automaker was facing a crisis after a string of costly recalls and other quality blunders and it needed to plot a new course, according to two people who attended the meeting.Since then, Hachigo has been quietly working on reforms to centralize decision-making by bringing Honda’s standalone research &amp; development (R&amp;D) division in-house and cutting some senior management roles, according to three Honda insiders.Expected to be announced early next year, the reforms are meant to simplify the way Honda designs cars and put its engineering resources to more effective use at a time when it needs to develop cars for an electric age, the sources said.“Decades ago, localization ... was the buzz word and our tech center independence was a key driver for innovation,�� said a former Honda executive who now is the head of one of its suppliers. “Those days are over.”The sources said Hachigo was poised to integrate Honda R&amp;D Co Ltd into Honda Motor Co Ltd so its technicians work more closely with key departments such as purchasing, manufacturing, quality assurance, and sales and marketing.“Honda believes strengthening the automotive business and reforming it in preparation for the arrival of next-generation mobility technologies are our most critical management tasks. This is a priority,�� a Honda spokeswoman said in response to questions about the plans.In the 1980s and much of the 1990s, the name Honda struck terror into the hearts of executives at the big three U.S. carmakers in Detroit because they simply couldn’t match its low-cost, efficient, well-built cars.But after a slew of recalls since 2014 for problems with components such as airbags, sliding doors and engines, Honda’s status as a benchmark for quality and efficiency has been seriously damaged - and the quality crisis is hitting profits.According to five Honda insiders, quality blunders have helped squeeze the operating margin at its global automotive business to 2%-3% - giving it less room for maneuver just as bigger rivals are building partnerships and overhauling their operations to become stronger.That’s in stark contrast to Honda’s motorcycle business which has already brought its R&amp;D division in-house and has a margin of 13.9%.In J.D. Power’s study of vehicle dependability in the United States, one of Honda’s two main auto markets along with China, the Japanese brand fell to 18th place this year from 5th in 2015 and 4th in 2002, its highest ranking.“These moves we’re making today will decide our eventual fate: whether we’re going to be in business as an independent player 10 to 15 years from now,�� a Honda source told Reuters.For an interactive graphic on Honda's automobile operations: tmsnrt.rs/35UnuNr‘CRAZY COMPLEXITY’A senior engineer at a technical center north of Tokyo in Utsunomiya, where Honda does much of its development, said the root of the problem was the “crazy complexity�� of its vehicle range and all the associated engineering processes.“Quality is acting up,�� the engineer said. “Honda has created too many regional models, in addition to an array of types, options and derivatives for its global models.”�All that’s eating up our profit.”In the United States, for example, Honda’s 2020 Accord sedan comes in 13 versions, including three hybrids. GM’s rival Malibu has five, though it doesn’t have hybrid models.At the two-day meeting in Utsunomiya, Hachigo and his procurement managers told suppliers to help Honda slash its range of cars and dumb down model types and options.They called on suppliers to use more common parts, from engines and transmissions to door handles, rear view mirrors and even knobs and switches, according to two people who attended the meeting and slides Honda used in presentations.Honda’s problems stem largely from an aggressive expansion before Hachigo took over in 2015. In addition to so-called global models such as the Civic, Accord and CR-V sports-utility vehicle (SUV), Honda developed a host of regional models which now account for 40% of its global car sales.They include the Crider sedan in China, the Brio and the Mobilio in southeast Asia, the WR-V in Latin America, which is also now sold in India, the Pilot SUV in the United States and the N-series of micro-minis in Japan.Its global models, which account for 60% of sales, come with an array of equipment options and vehicle trims that Hachigo, an engineer by training who has worked at Honda since 1982, has called unnecessary product derivatives.The explosion in the number of regional models had an unintended consequence: the engineering became more complex and the elevated workload led to lapses in quality and costly recalls, two company sources said.Even though the impact of the Takata airbag crisis had largely subsided by 2017, Honda still put aside 520 billion yen ($4.8 billion) in the 12 months through March 2017 for product warranties and over 450 billion in each of the past two years.In the four years before the Takata debacle, warranty provisions ranged from 171 billion to 274 billion yen, before surging to 727 billion in the year ending March 2016.In 2018, for example, Honda recalled about 600,000 cars in China because sludge was collecting in the engines of six models when driven in cold weather while the sliding doors on its U.S. Odyssey minivans started opening while the vehicles were moving.For an interactive graphic on Honda's car troubles: tmsnrt.rs/2KXziX6‘BACK TO THE MOTHERSHIP’Hachigo flagged some of the issues at a news conference in May, saying he wanted to eliminate two-thirds of derivative products on global models by 2025 and wean Honda off its tendency to go overboard by creating colors, model types and options specific to different regions.He said he was aiming to cut engineers�� workloads by about a third to free up time and resources for Honda’s technical divisions to research technologies for the cars of the future.What Hachigo and senior Honda officials haven’t discussed publicly are the planned structural reforms to help its quality and efficiency drive - and the main target is its R&amp;D division, three company sources said.Besides the quality issues and engineering workload linked to the proliferation of regional models, the advent of new technologies requires Honda’s big-spending technical division to act less independently, two sources said.“In many ways, Honda’s tech companies behave much like university labs, and that was fine in years past,�� the former Honda executive and supplier said.By putting decision-makers in Honda’s Tokyo headquarters, the hope is that the R&amp;D division will deploy capital and human resources more economically.Honda’s R&amp;D and engineering units are expected to spend 860 billion yen this financial year, or 5.5% of expected revenue. Toyota, whose revenue is double, is expected to spend 1.1 trillion yen, or 3.7% of its global revenue, on technology.Two company sources said Hachigo plans to eliminate the top management roles at Honda R&amp;D and will probably turn some into divisional managers within Honda Motor.One source said the aim was: “to centralize the company’s fragmented, localized decision-making power back at the mothership in Tokyo.”According to the engineer, Honda has also introduced an internal quality target to cut global recalls by two-thirds in the next few years from a crisis level of 6 million in 2017.It was clear at the two-day suppliers�� powwow that Hachigo meant business.Without naming names, Honda executives discussed exemplary product development projects - and bad ones - so lessons could be learned. It was fairly obvious within Honda’s small community of suppliers who was being singled out and they weren’t happy, said one supplier at the meeting.So much so that some skipped golf on day two.	-0.474571469
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s top three automakers said on Wednesday they will spend up to 6 billion yen ($48.92 million) combined to subsidize the cost of operating hydrogen fuelling stations as the country aims to lead the world in developing cars that use the fuel.Japan is set to miss an ambitious target of having around 100 of the fuelling stations in place by March next year, as part of plans to develop a so-called hydrogen society to help cut carbon emissions and alleviate its heavy reliance on overseas fossil fuels.Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co said in a joint statement they would shoulder about one-third of the operational costs for hydrogen stations, limiting annual support to 11 million yen ($89,700) per station.The automakers will split the cost roughly based on the number of fuel-cell vehicles each company sells, Toyota Senior Managing Officer Kiyotaka Ise told a news conference. Toyota’s Mirai, launched in December, is the only fuel-cell vehicle (FCV) on sale now and production is set to be limited to 700 in the first year.Honda has said it would roll out an FCV by next March, and Nissan’s is not due until 2017 at the earliest.Only 74 stations are planned so far due to the high cost of building them.Hydrogen stations cost about $5 million to build and the government’s subsidy for one location is capped at around half that. Even with the generous handouts, the stations are expected to be loss-making for at least the first decade, industry officials say.The subsidies from the automakers, expected to last until 2020, would include operational costs such as labor and refurbishment, they said in the statement.Fuel-cell cars, which run on hydrogen and emit only water, are also expensive, requiring big subsidies themselves.	0.3239171375
DETROIT, May 15 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co has fallen behind its top North American competitors in the health of its working relationships with suppliers while General Motors Co jumped to third place in rankings released on Monday.Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co maintained their longstanding first and second rankings in the study which looked at the six biggest automakers in North America and is closely watched in the industry.GM’s leap knocked Detroit cross-town rival Ford Motor Co into fourth place and Nissan’s fall from fifth to sixth place meant Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) avoided coming last as it had done since 2008, despite a lower index score than in 2016.Automakers�� profitability is directly linked to good working relations with their suppliers, said study author John Henke, head of Planning Perspectives Inc, a firm that focuses on company-supplier relations.Since the study began in 2002, Toyota has been first and Honda second on the study’s OEM-Supplier Working Relations Index except for two years when the two Japanese automakers swapped the two top spots.The study shows the results of surveys of 652 salespeople at 108 first-tier suppliers to the six automakers.GM’s rise to third place and its implications for profitability are good news for the No. 1 U.S. automaker and its chief executive Mary Barra as it wages a proxy battle with Greenlight Capital. The hedge fund has proposed splitting GM stock into two classes: one that pays dividends and one that does not.The automaker has rejected the idea and rating agencies have said it would negatively affect GM’s credit rating.The index shows that under Barra - who took over the helm at the automaker in 2014 - GM has gone from joint last with FCA in 2015 to third place.“If you look at the direction GM is taking, this has all happened since Mary Barra took over,�� Henke said. “She is changing the company.”Henke said Nissan’s drop to the bottom reflected an aggressive push by the Japanese automaker to cut costs. But he said the survey results showed GM was making a similar push.GM showed improvement across all areas included in the survey, including helpfulness and providing “profit opportunity�� to suppliers. Nissan posted declines in virtually every area.“GM is putting more pressure on their suppliers to reduce prices and improve quality than Nissan is,�� he said. “The question is not whether you pressure suppliers but how you do it and GM is doing it the right way.�� (Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Andrew Hay)	0.2725307772
GENEVA (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will turn a profit in its European automotive business during the current fiscal year for the first time since 2007, a feat the company expects to repeat in fiscal 2013 as new models help seize market share from rivals.“In 2013, we want to sell more than 2012, even if we don’t know yet what the volume will be,�� said Didier Leroy, the head of Toyota’s European operations. “Based on the market share, we can, we will make a profit.”Since 2010, Leroy has spearheaded a restructuring of Toyota’s European business while the automaker faced a safety crisis in the United States and production halts after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.Those cost cuts, which included a 40 percent reduction in headcount at Toyota’s headquarters in Brussels, helped boost its bottom line in Europe during fiscal 2012, which ends this month.The Japanese automaker also is helped by its broad definition of Europe. Toyota counts 56 countries, including Israel and Russia, as part of its European market. By that definition, Toyota sales rose 2 percent last year.Toyota’s car sales in Europe, defined as 27 countries by trade association ACEA, fell 3 percent in 2012.But that is still better than the 8.2 percent decline that the entire auto industry faced in Europe, where the economic slump has caused auto sales to shrink, ACEA data show.Next year, Toyota expects sales and market share gains to be buoyed by new models, higher capacity utilization at its factories and further cost cuts.The automaker sees benefits from the increased popularity of hybrids, which have reached a “tipping point�� in Europe, Karl Schlicht, Toyota’s head of European sales, said during a media roundtable before the opening of the Geneva car show.Toyota expects hybrids to account for at least 17 percent of its sales in Europe in 2013, up from 13 percent in 2012.��(Toyota) is sort of pushing very hard with a renewed product range to make up for lost ground for the last couple of years,�� said Tom De Vleesschauwer, director of long-term planning and sustainability for IHS Automotive. “We do expect they will fight back quite well.”�ALL BETS OFF�� IF EUROPE COLLAPSESDuring the roundtable, Leroy reiterated that the company is aiming to sell 1 million vehicles in Europe by 2015, including Lexus brand cars. But executives also left open the possibility that if the market deteriorates sharply, Toyota would reconsider the sales target.“If we can continue to reduce costs and rationalize, we think we can get there,�� Schlicht told reporters. “Our assumption, though, is if there is a complete collapse in the European market, all bets are off.”To support the goal of 1 million annual vehicle sales, Toyota aims to build in Europe 75 percent of the vehicles it sells in the region, Leroy said. That compares with about 63 percent at present.Toyota is also reshuffling production plans in Europe and expects capacity utilization to increase to 80 percent by the end of the process. Toyota could not immediately describe its current utilization.Analysts said the weak yen is now allowing the company to offer higher incentives on its models, while still maintaining a good profit margin. Leroy said the automaker is enjoying the benefits of the weak yen, but that this is not a long-term strategy.“We don’t want to build our business model on the currency situation,�� Leroy told reporters.	2.255566312
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it is advancing by a year plans to replace Takata airbags in about 65,000 Toyota and Lexus vehicles in the United States it had previously replaced.The Japanese carmaker's U.S. subsidiary said the recall is being announced a year ahead of the December 2019 timeline and would involve replacing Takata airbags that it previously recalled and replaced, with non-Takata airbags at no cost.(toyota.us/2PxWSZZ)Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June last year after recalling more than 100 million of its air bag inflators worldwide as they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments.The recall announced on Wednesday affects certain Toyota Corolla, Sequoia, Tundra and Lexus vehicles which were made between 2002 and 2005.	3.816857096
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 12 states led by California and New York on Friday challenged the Trump administration’s decision to suspend a 2016 Obama administration regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers that fail to meet fuel efficiency requirements.Automakers protested the higher penalties, which they said could cost the industry up to $1 billion annually, and the Trump administration finalized the regulatory freeze on July 12. The 12 states, joined by the District of Columbia, filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reverse the rule released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust a wide range of civil penalties to account for inflation and, in response, the NHTSA, under Democratic President Barack Obama, issued rules to eventually raise fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of the required standards.The NHTSA, in response to a question on the lawsuit, on Friday reiterated its statement from last month that it was following the intent of Congress to ensure the penalty rate was set at the level required by law.In a statement, the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said the Trump administration wants to “make these penalties meaningless,�� while New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, called the rule “another misguided and reckless attempt by the Trump Administration to roll back the clock on our clean air standards.”The move comes as the NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency are working to finalize a rewrite of the Obama administration’s fuel efficiency requirements through 2026.The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration’s preferred option.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co GM., Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and others, had said the higher penalties could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually and result in ""significant economic harm.""Some automakers historically have paid fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements. In February, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI told Reuters it had paid $77 million in U.S. civil penalties in 2018 for failing to meet 2016 economy requirements.Environmental groups urged the administration to retain the increase, noting U.S. fuel economy fines have lost nearly 75% of their original value."	2.548713952
DETROIT (Reuters) - Detroit automakers reported another month of strong demand from U.S. consumers for trucks and sport utility vehicles on Tuesday, but their shares dropped as analysts focused on signs the world’s second-largest auto market has little room to grow.U.S. light vehicle sales in April totaled 1.51 million, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier, for a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.42 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. WardsAuto said annualized sales were 17.32 million vehicles.U.S. auto sales in 2015 hit a record 17.4 million vehicles.Wall Street analysts say the U.S. auto market is close to a cyclical peak and that more production cuts, which hurt profit, could be needed to keep inventories of vehicles from ballooning later in the year.“We continue to believe sales growth will be muted this year,�� Joseph Spak of RBC Capital said in a note to investors.Inventory data issued early on Tuesday pointed to some possible “risk to North American production over the coming months,�� Spak added.The sluggish pace of U.S. economic growth adds to concerns that the auto industry recovery could run out of fuel.April auto sales in Canada were the highest for any month on record, at 200,327 vehicles, consultant Dennis DesRosiers said. Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota all reported double-digit gains in Canada.Shares of General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N closed down 1.6 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, as the broader market also declined, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N shares fell 3 percent to $7.96.GM and Ford said sales to individual consumers were still growing. But because GM has been cutting back on low-profit sales to rental car companies and other fleets, its overall April U.S. sales fell by 3.5 per cent.GM’s results were among many that highlighted a divide in the market between slumping sales of traditional sedans, and robust demand for pickup trucks and SUVs.GM said sales of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck rose nearly 9 percent in April compared with a year earlier. However, sales of GM’s Cadillac CTS and ATS luxury sedans plummeted 23 percent and 18 percent, respectively.Other luxury brands also had weak results in April, especially for cars. Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus division suffered a 26 percent decline in sales of cars such as the large LS sedan, although sales of Lexus brand SUVs rose 20 percent.German luxury car maker BMW AG BMWG.DE said sales of its BMW brand passenger cars fell 6.5 percent, while its SUV sales fell 9.7 percent. The chief executives of two leading auto dealer groups, AutoNation Inc AN.N and Group 1 Automotive GPI.N, had warned in April that automakers should start curbing production, particularly of slow-selling luxury sedans.Still, April U.S. sales for Ford, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T all beat analysts' expectations. Ford's sales rose 4 percent from a year earlier, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was up 5.6 percent and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, No. 3 in the U.S. market, rose 3.8 percent. Honda sales rose 14.4 percent.	2.862254025
TOKYO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's electric vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) 300750.SZ said it will start offering products to homes and plants in Japan in 2020, as it seeks to expand its global presence and diversify its business.The Chinese firm will provide batteries under a partnership with Japanese solar power company Next Energy and Resources, which will be responsible for assembling and installing the energy storage systems that they plan to sell on to Japanese utilities and other energy providers, the companies said in a statement.Tan Libin, vice president of the energy storage business unit at CATL, told reporters that the firm was looking to Japan as the country’s solar power market was expanding and feed-in-tariffs, which had guaranteed minimum power prices to spur solar development, will start to expire later this year.CATL said their systems will reduce the cost to households as service providers will pay for their installation, while excess power can be stored and transmitted to city grids.“We hope to quickly assimilate into the local market through in-depth cooperation with local Japanese companies,�� said Tan.CATL, based in Fujian province in southeast China, has strategic agreements with carmakers including SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS, Geely 0175.HK, BMW BMWG.DE and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and is building its first European production site in Germany.It is also expanding its business into batteries for ships and storage systems.	-0.8866995074

VIENNA, April 27 (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen will keep its plants in Europe despite weak markets in the region that will require flexible manufacturing and could entail cuts to temporary staff, Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said.Winterkorn had told shareholders in Europe’s top carmaker on Thursday to brace for a tough year given faltering European consumer demand that is punishing the sector.In an interview with Austrian broadcaster ORF aired late on Friday, Winterkorn said VW would not follow the example of other automakers and scale back production in Europe.“No, we will not withdraw any capacity from Europe but rather preserve capacity in Europe,�� he said. But he left the door open to trimming temporary staff that the company built up in boom years.“The regular staff is certainly something we will hold on to. We will have to think about temporary staff,�� he said.Volkswagen said last month it planned to almost double production capacity in China over the next five years to grab a bigger slice of fast-growing emerging markets and offset declining demand at home.Its goal is to snatch the global sales crown from Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp in 2018.	5.697614553
* Hard to hit cost targets for budget car - VW brand exec* Says will keep trying to meet internal cost requirements* Lack of budget car for emerging markets a problem for VW* Hyundai, Toyota, Renault see strong growth in the segment (Adds analyst comment, background)By Andreas CremerGENEVA, March 4 (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s plan to build a budget car for emerging markets, a key part of its drive to become the world’s biggest automaker, has stalled because the German group is struggling to meet cost targets for the vehicle, a VW executive told Reuters.Europe’s largest carmaker has been trying for more than a year to hit internal cost requirements for the vehicle, which would likely sell for between 6,000 euros ($8,300) and 8,000 euros and be built in China, the biggest market for budget cars.“It’s becoming more and more difficult�� to hit cost goals necessary to approve production of a budget car, VW brand development chief Heinz-Jakob Neusser told Reuters at the Geneva auto show Tuesday.“It makes no sense to approve a vehicle that’s not meeting our targets,�� he said, adding VW would keep working on fulfilling the requirements.VW lacks a strong presence in markets such as India and southeast Asia which are dominated by no-frills models, and without a successful budget car, analysts have questioned whether the group will be able to meet its goal of becoming the world’s biggest carmaker by 2018.A 2009 partnership with Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T), designed to benefit from the Japanese manufacturer’s leading position in India, fell apart in 2011 in a public squabble.In the meantime, low cost cars from rivals such as Hyundai and Toyota have powered ahead in Asia. France’s Renault has also been cushioned from a slump in European car sales by its expansion into entry-level cars, which surged to account for 41 percent of its global registrations from below 30 percent in just two years.“News regarding cost problems related to VW’s internal structures aren’t new,�� said Arndt Ellinghorst, London-based analyst at ISI Group. “But the fact that these keep coming up, despite (the cost-cutting) MQB modular platform and in light of VW’s light outlook, is somewhat alerting.”On Feb. 21, VW toned down its guidance for 2014 operating profit even after publishing record earnings of 11.7 billion euros ($16.1 billion) for 2013 which beat company expectations.If approved, a budget car would undercut VW’s 9,850-euro Up! city car, the brand’s smallest and cheapest model that is only sold in Europe and Japan. The two-door vehicle came to market in December 2011 and was launched as VW’s first electric-powered car last year.To keep down assembly costs, VW has said it would use pre-existing mechanics from models that have gone out of production or are nearing the end of production, rather than develop new costly underpinnings for the budget car from scratch.	-1.76584849
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T plans to sell a new version of its Prius petrol-electric hybrid from the end of 2015 in Japan and in other regions thereafter, at a time when tumbling gasoline prices are sapping demand for environment-friendlier cars.The new Prius will run on smaller, lighter motors and batteries than its predecessor, and be at least 10 percent more fuel-efficient, Toyota said, without stating mileage. The previous model can run at 51 miles a gallon.Thermal efficiency - or ratio of work performed to energy consumed - will be 40 percent, up from 38.5 percent, the company also said.The car, unveiled in Las Vegas late on Tuesday, is the first model built under the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) strategy, a new approach to development to improve its cars�� fuel efficiency, styling and other features, partly by using more common components.The launch comes at a challenging time for Toyota. U.S. petrol prices are at their lowest for this time of year since 2004, pushing consumers to trade in hybrids and electric vehicles in favor of sports utility vehicles.August Prius sales in the U.S. fell 24 percent from the same month a year earlier to 17,757 cars.

NAIROBI, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Tsusho has won a contract to design an oil export pipeline from Uganda to Kenya’s coast, a Kenyan official said on Wednesday, as the countries seek to start crude production.Oil discoveries in Uganda and Kenya and gas deposits found off Tanzania and Mozambique have turned east Africa into a frontier for hydrocarbon exploration.Landlocked Uganda is planning to start crude production in 2018, while in neighbouring Kenya, Tullow Oil and Africa Oil are expected to submit development plans in late 2015.Kenya estimates its crude oil reserves to be about 1 billion barrels - which experts say is enough to make a pipeline viable even without Uganda, which estimates its reserves at 6.5 billion barrels.In June, the two countries and Rwanda invited bids for a consultant to oversee a feasibility study and initial design for the construction of the 1,300 km (808 mile) pipeline estimated to cost about $4.5 billion.“Toyota Tsusho have already been awarded the contract for the feasibility study and preliminary engineering design, their final report is expected by mid-April next year,�� Joseph Njoroge, the energy ministry’s principal secretary said on Wednesday.Kenya’s government has said that the pipeline designer would also be required to supervise the construction of a fibre optic cable from Uganda’s oil fields in Hoima through the Lokichar basin in northwest Kenya, where the country has found oil deposits, to Kenya’s proposed Lamu port.The consultant is also expected to design tank terminals in Hoima, Lokichar and Lamu, the ministry said.

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co has taken a step back into gasoline hybrids with its Note e-Power model, which the Japanese automaker hopes will act as a gateway for drivers who will later shift to all-electric cars.The move will also trim Nissan’s costs.Nissan’s battery-electric Leaf, the industry’s first mass-market, all-electric car launched in 2010, is the world’s top-selling electric vehicle (EV), but sales have failed to reach initial targets. Globally, more than 250,000 Leaf cars have been sold.With drivers yet to be fully won over by electric cars, Nissan hopes its new “near-electric�� hybrid - which shares some parts with the Leaf - will allow it to shave costs and fend off competition in developing cheaper electric cars.It’s a reversal of sorts for Nissan. When it developed the Leaf, CEO Carlos Ghosn signaled Nissan would leapfrog gasoline-hybrid technology and go straight to battery-powered cars with zero emissions.That has left it trailing rivals including Toyota Motor Corp in hybrids, a segment between gasoline-powered cars and EVs. Toyota has sold more than 9 million hybrids since it launched the Prius in 1997.“We can’t avoid the fact that EVs remain expensive compared with conventional gasoline vehicles, while there’s also an ongoing assumption that EVs aren’t suited to traveling long ranges,�� Hideyuki Sakamoto, a Nissan executive vice president, told Reuters.For a graphic on the global electric vehicle market, click tmsnrt.rs/2kpOFLLTo view a graphic on types of electric vehicles, click tmsnrt.rs/2kQpVd5Late last year, Nissan launched the e-Note, a compact hatchback that uses the same motor as the Leaf. The Note operates like an EV, but instead of drawing its power from a large, costly battery, it uses a smaller battery that is charged by a gasoline engine.The result is similar to General Motors�� Chevrolet Volt, an electric car that resorts to its engine for charge when the battery is running low.With a starting price of 1.77 million yen ($15,577), the e-Note, so far available only in Japan, is nearly 40 percent cheaper than the all-electric Leaf.Nissan says affordability is key to attracting drivers and eventually getting them to upgrade to pure electric cars.Sakamoto said he hopes to eventually use the Note’s new e-Power hybrid system for most of Nissan’s hybrid offerings - helping lower production costs for both hybrids and EVs.“Until now, components including the inverter and motor were different between our hybrids and EVs. But the new system is different in that it shares parts with the Leaf. This creates manufacturing efficiencies,�� he said, declining to give details.The e-Power system is Nissan’s second foray into hybrids.It launched its first in 2010, but with a limited range of hybrid models Nissan shipped just 95,000 such vehicles in the year to last March, a fraction of its total global sales of 5.4 million vehicles.Nissan has said it is developing affordable, compact EVs for China, the world’s biggest autos market, and may use a plug-in hybrid system developed by Mitsubishi Motors, in which it bought a controlling stake last year. It is also developing a fuel cell vehicle which runs on electric power generated from ethanol.Tougher emissions regulations, particularly in China, promote battery-electric and plug-in hybrid cars over gasoline hybrids and conventional gasoline vehicles.($1 = 113.6300 yen)	-1.414476556
BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s core brand suffered its first fall in sales in more than a decade last year and the carmaker said that markets will remain “challenging�� in 2016 as it battles to contain the damage from its emissions scandal.Deliveries of VW-branded vehicles fell 4.8 percent to 5.82 million cars on weakening demand in China and the United States and the effects of the company’s rigging of diesel emissions tests, the company said on Friday.The underperformance at VW’s largest division by sales and revenue pulled down annual group deliveries, including the Audi and Porsche premium brands, by 2 percent to 9.93 million cars, the first drop in 13 years, VW said.“We must handle the situation on world markets where trends remain mixed,�� Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said.Group sales in China, a stable source of revenue for VW for years and the carmaker’s biggest market, fell 3.4 percent to 3.55 million autos while deliveries in Europe were up 2.5 percent to 3.95 million, the Wolfsburg-based firm said.VW had briefly pulled ahead of global sales champion Toyota after six months, though slipped behind the Japanese rival in the second half of last year when the emissions scandal broke.Toyota and U.S. rival General Motors are expected to publish full-year auto sales later this month.	-4.947304242
TOKYO, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Daihatsu Motor Co said it is recalling a record 892,000 vehicles, mostly in Japan, over an engine sensor glitch.The sensor could break because a coil inside is not durable enough and the engine could stop when the car is running or may not start at all, the carmaker said in a statement filed to Japan’s transport ministry.No accidents have been reported as a result of the glitch, said Daihatsu, a group company of Toyota Motor Corp that makes 660 cc minicars.The recalled vehicles, manufactured between November 2005 and June 2010, include certain models of the Tanto and the Mira. Daihatsu is also recalling around 40 vehicles in Hong Kong, a spokesman said.Since it will take time to prepare components needed to replace the sensor, Daihatsu will first make a change in a computer programme that controls the engine, which will take about 10 minutes, the spokesman said. From April 2014, it will start replacing the sensor, which will take around 40 to 50 minutes, he said.	3.844015567
TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp will continue focusing on driving performance over fuel economy, its chief executive said, even as the Japanese automaker follows bigger rivals in bringing more electric vehicles (EVs) to the market over the coming decade.As bigger rivals such as Nissan Motor Co plan to roll out more all-battery EVs in coming years, Mazda is betting more on mild hybrids which preserve the feel of gasoline-powered cars while improving fuel economy and reducing emissions.“We have to be careful in how we say this, but our first priority is on driving performance,�� Mazda CEO Akira Marumoto told reporters earlier this week.“We want to improve fuel economy, but above that we want to use (our) new engine to improve driving performance.”A key feature of Mazda’s mild hybrids will be its new Skyactiv X engine, unveiled last year after a decade of development. It will be used in the revamped Mazda3 sedan and hatchback models, which will be introduced later this month before going on sale in the United States next year.The new engine will deliver as much as 30 percent fuel efficiency over its existing Skyactiv G engine, already one of the most fuel-efficient gasoline engines in the market.In October, the automaker said all of the vehicles it produces by 2030 will incorporate electrification. While 5 percent of its cars will be battery EVs by then, Marumoto said he expected the remainder would mainly be mild hybrids which use its Skyactiv engines.Mazda has been struggling to keep up with its rivals in developing new vehicle technologies including self-driving cars and EVs as its R&amp;D budget is a fraction of industry leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp.The company, known for its unique rotary engine and its MX-5 roadster, has tried to differentiate itself by promising a smoother ride which characterises many of its existing vehicles.Mazda has partnered with Toyota to pool resources and jointly develop EVs and other new car technologies, but Marumoto said that it had no plans to offer the new engine technology to the company’s bigger partner.“In the end, we are competitors,�� Marumoto said.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The number of new cars registered in New Zealand rose 6.5 percent in September from the previous month, figures from the New Zealand Transport Agency showed on Friday, pointing to an uptick in consumer demand.A total of 7,272 new cars were registered last month, 9.6 percent more than the same period last year, according to the data.Overall car registrations, new and used, fell 3.8 percent last month due to a 11.9 percent fall in used cars, but were up 15.8 percent from a year ago.The number of new commercial vehicle registrations rose 6.5 percent on the month to be 35.3 percent higher compared with a year ago.The top-selling marker of new cars registered for the month was Toyota 7203.T, with 1,544, followed by Hyundai 005380.KS and Ford F.N.	1.265526131
TOKYO, June 14 (Reuters) - Japan’s Honda Motor Co. will delay the start of production of gasoline-electric hybrid cars in China in a bid to source cheaper parts, a company official said, in an apparent response to rival Toyota’s cost-saving measures.Honda had intended to start local production of hybrid cars in China by as early as next year, but said on Friday local production had been put back “to within three years�� in order to source cheaper components from parts suppliers in China.“Affordability is critical,�� said Natsuno Asanuma, the Honda spokeswoman in Beijing.Honda provided no further details about the type of components it wanted to source more cheaply, or on possible joint ventures with Chinese companies.China has been the world’s biggest auto market since 2009, but hybrid sales have been comparatively slow. That could soon change, however, as Beijing is looking at boosting subsidies to increase sales of “new-energy�� cars.Honda’s delay comes after Toyota Motor Corp said last month it was trying to source key hybrid components in China to make hybrids more affordable. Toyota said it was planning a joint venture in China with a local supplier to produce batteries for gas-electric hybrid cars.The move comes as Toyota - and other automakers in China, both indigenous Chinese and foreign - gear up to try to kick-start sales of “conventional�� hybrid cars in China in anticipation of policy changes aimed at boosting sales of hybrid vehicles.Under the current policy, China provides generous subsidies for private purchases of all-electric battery vehicles and heavily electrified “near all-electric�� plug-in hybrids, but only limited support for the conventional gas-electric hybrids.A growing number of industry insiders and experts believe Beijing will boost purchase subsidies significantly for conventional hybrids as early as this year.On Friday, Honda also said it planned to introduce 12 new or significantly redesigned models before the end of 2015 in China. Previously, Honda had said it planned to launch more than 10 such new and significantly redesigned models in China.	7.692307692
JUNEAU Alaska (Reuters) - Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee for vice president, was issued a speeding citation in her hometown of Wasilla, court records showed on Wednesday.The July 16 citation carries a potential fine of $154, and Palin has 30 days from the date of receiving the citation to respond to it, the records showed.Police pulled Palin over while she was driving her black Toyota Tundra pickup bearing the license plate LOVUSA, the Alaska Dispatch News reported on Wednesday. It said the former governor was driving 63 miles per hour in a 45-mph speed zone while returning from a bikram hot yoga workout.“I was thinking, I wasn’t speeding, I was qualifying,�� Palin told the Dispatch News.Wasilla Police spokesman Officer Rick Manrique declined to comment on the case, and an attorney for Palin could not be reached for comment.Palin, since stepping down as governor of Alaska in 2009, has endorsed and campaigned for a number of conservative candidates for Congress.Last year, she helped rally members of the conservative Tea Party movement in a failed effort to defund President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law.	-3.777852237
SYDNEY, April 16 (Reuters) - Japanese shares on Thursday tracked overnight losses on the Wall Street, as economic damage from COVID-19 weighed on investor sentiment, with banks and automakers leading the declines.The benchmark Nikkei average ended 1.3% lower at 19,290.20. The Nikkei’s volatility index, a measure of investors�� volatility expectations based on option pricing and considered to be a fear gauge, rose 8.6% to 39.36.On Wednesday, all three major U.S. stock indexes fell as the raft of weak economic data and dismal first-quarter earnings reports compounded concerns over the extent of damage from the coronavirus pandemic.U.S. retail sales and manufacturing output saw sharp declines, while disappointing earnings from Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc added to worries about weak U.S. corporate results.Taking a cue from this, Tokyo-listed banks fell, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Inc, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) Inc and Mizuho Financial Group Inc shedding between 2.1% and 3.3%.The broader Topix fell 0.8% to 1,422.24, with two-thirds of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo exchange finishing lower.Highly cyclical sea transport, transport equipment and non-ferrous metals were the worst three performing indexes on the main bourse.“We have downgraded Japan to a neutral from favour, reflecting fuller relative valuations and softer fundamentals in the current global setting,�� said Natasha Ebtehadj, portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in London.“Although, still supported by the long-term structural improvement story of better corporate governance, Japan is a strongly cyclical and operationally leveraged market that is highly exposed to ��sudden stops�� in global activity.”Toyota Motor Corp slid 2.0% after the carmaker said it will cut production of finished vehicles at 18 plants in Japan due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Mazda Motor Corp lost between 3.8% and 5.2%.JFE Holdings fell 3.3% on news that its unit JFE Steel will temporarily halt two blast furnaces in western Japan, potentially cutting 25% of its capacity.Its bigger rival Nippon Steel, which announced a similar plan earlier this month, fell 3.1% to hit its lowest level in data going back as far as 1973.Bucking the overall trend, the Nikkei’s heavyweight SoftBank Group Corp advanced 2.2% after the tech conglomerate said it re-purchased shares worth 16 billion yen ($148 million) in late-March.The index of Mothers start-up shares climbed 2.7% to 730.88, its highest close since March 5.	-1.937125503
* Raises full-year net profit forecast 13 pct* Second-quarter net profit rises 70 pct to 438.4 bln yen* Raises North American 2013/14 car sales forecast* Gain in quarterly net profit outperforms big Japan rivalsBy Yoko KubotaTOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is closing in on a record profit set before the Lehman crisis after topping up its annual net profit forecast by nearly $2 billion and outperforming Japanese rivals as its expansion plans bear fruit.The world’s best-selling carmaker is racking up strong sales in a healthy U.S. market while keeping costs in check and taking a breather from building new facilities, in contrast to Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co which are grappling with heavy expansion costs.Toyota, one of the most export-reliant Japanese carmakers, is also reaping the benefits of a weakening yen that has boosted its profit margins but acknowledged it will have to start spending more to maintain its advantage.“Our basic stance of controlling fixed costs and improving gross profit will not change, but we do need aggressive investment in order to brush up on future technology,�� Managing Officer Takuo Sasaki told an earnings briefing on Wednesday.Toyota credited its conservative strategy as a key factor when it raised its net profit forecast by 190 billion yen to 1.67 trillion yen ($16.95 billion) for the year ending in March 2014, just short of its record 1.72 trillion yen from six years ago.A Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 23 analysts gave an average forecast of 1.79 trillion yen. Toyota’s annual operating profit rises by 40 billion yen for every one-yen rise in the value of the dollar.Toyota, which went through a rapid expansion before booking huge losses in the year ended March 2009, now appears to be in the sweet spot of industry and currency market trends, and is reaping the rewards of it own investments in production.But some analysts warned against complacency.“There are clearly risks of Toyota starting to lag in growth pace to its peers,�� said Takaki Nakanishi, an auto industry analyst and CEO of Nakanishi Research Institute in Tokyo.“If the decisions (on future expansion) are too slow, that may cause slower growth and that could make Toyota’s earnings grow slower than its competitors.”Market participants also worried that the company might be too stingy with its cash.“Toyota is representative of Japanese companies and even though it is generating so much profit its dividend yield of 2 percent is not enough,�� said BNP Paribas Securities chief Japan equity strategist Shun Maruyama.For the July-September quarter, Toyota said net profit rose 70 percent to 438.4 billion yen, in line with the average estimate of 441.01 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of six analysts and outpacing Japan’s second-biggest carmaker Nissan and No.3 Honda Motor Co.Last week, Nissan posted a meagre 2 percent quarterly net profit growth while Honda booked a 46 percent rise.Nissan is aiming to raise its global market share to 8 percent from last year’s 6.2 percent and has been scrambling to build capacity worldwide. It is constructing eight new plants and expanding a factory in Russia.Nissan plans capital expenditure equal to about 5 percent of revenue this financial year, compared with Toyota’s 4 percent. On Wednesday, Toyota slightly raised its annual capital expenditure outlook by 2 percent to 940 billion yen.To ease the burden of its expansion, Nissan and its partner Renault SA unveiled a potentially wide-ranging operating alliance this week with Mitsubishi Motors Corp .Nissan’s quick but messy expansion has left it underperforming Toyota in the United States after running into product launch troubles and quality issues.In July-September, Toyota’s U.S. sales grew 12.2 percent year-on-year compared to Nissan’s 9.6 percent rise. Industry-wide sales grew about 9 percent year-on-year during that period.Toyota on Wednesday nudged up its North America sales forecast to 2.63 million vehicles from 2.61 million, helping to offset a drop in its Asia sales forecast to 1.64 million from 1.7 million.Toyota’s shares ended 0.5 percent higher, compared with a 0.8 percent rise for Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei average.For the year to date, Toyota’s shares are up nearly 60 percent, outpacing a 9 percent rise for Nissan, which was hit hard this week after cutting its full-year profit forecast on Friday, and Honda’s 25 percent rise.Toyota sold the most cars among automakers worldwide in January-September, beating General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG.	-2.771601017
(Repeats story first published on Friday)SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Big companies in the United States from Amazon.com Inc to Toyota Motor Corp and Alcoa Corp are working to counter the effect of the Trump administration’s trade policies and to head off new tariffs.Companies are attempting to avoid any confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump but want to exert as much influence as they can to dissuade him from tearing up trade agreements or introducing tariffs on a wide swath of imports.Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer and cloud-computing company, which could be hurt by tariffs on items sold through its website and components for its data centers, is discussing industry-wide advertising campaigns and more extensive government lobbying, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.Amazon declined to comment.Toyota Motor North America, a subsidiary of Japan’s Toyota, which could suffer if Trump follows through on a plan to impose tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, flew workers to Washington for a rally this week in front of the U.S. Capitol while the unit’s chief has met key members of Congress in recent weeks to discuss the potential impact of tariffs.Executives from General Motors Co, which could be hurt if Trump pulls the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement or if he imposes auto tariffs, have also held meetings with the administration and Congress over the last year to raise its concerns about trade issues. Tariffs would lead to “a reduced presence at home and abroad,�� the company said in June.The largest U.S. automaker is set to hire Trump’s former deputy director of the National Economic Council and adviser on international economic affairs. Everett Eissenstat, who left the White House earlier this month, will head GM’s public policy efforts, according to sources familiar with the matter.GM told Reuters it had an opening but declined to confirm the hire. Eissenstat could not be reached for comment.Those already suffering from the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect in June, are also pushing for relief in private.The chief executive of Alcoa told investors on a conference call this week that the aluminum producer was in “active discussions�� with the Trump administration, the Commerce Department and members of Congress about the elimination of tariffs or getting an exception for Canadian aluminum.Alcoa said this week it will incur as much as $14 million a month in extra expenses, mainly from tariffs levied on aluminum imported from Canada, its biggest supplier.In addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs already imposed, the Trump administration has threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods which would affect thousands of imported products from furniture to network routers.Seattle-based Amazon is concerned such tariffs would hit shoppers during the crucial holiday shopping season, the person familiar with the matter said.Amazon has identified a wide range of items, some of them high-value, the tariffs would hit and is assessing the potential impact on its business, the person said.High among its concerns is an increase in import costs for components used in data centers or other items that would make its cloud computing division less competitive, two people familiar with the matter said. Amazon Web Services is the company’s most profitable unit.Amazon is not alone in the technology industry with its worries. “It’s hard to think of many of our companies that don’t have some risk and exposure as a result of the tariff,�� said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, which counts Amazon rivals Microsoft Corp , Alphabet Inc’s Google and others as members.Lobbying administration officials and members of Congress can be costly with no guarantee of victory, but some have succeeded.Apple Inc won guarantees from the Trump administration that its lucrative iPhones would ship from China without being subject to tariffs, the New York Times reported last month.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Wednesday said it faces a $79 million U.S. civil penalty for failing to meet 2017 fuel economy requirements, as regulators reported more automakers were falling short of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions standards.The Italian-American automaker said the payment is not expected to have a material impact on its business.Of 18 major carmakers in the United States, 13 including Fiat Chrysler, failed to comply with fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for the 2017 model year without using credits, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).The agency said its review of model year 2017 vehicles showed “automakers falling further behind current standards.”The 2017 model fleet fell 1-1/2 miles per gallon short of the 33.8 mpg standard based on yearly performance without including credits, NHTSA reported. The shortfall was 1/2 mile per gallon for the 2016 model year.NHTSA said more automakers were failing to comply with standards for the 2018 and 2019 model years, “and the potential penalties on automakers, which are passed along to consumers, are expected to continue to increase.”The Trump administration has used the widening gap between the emissions of automakers�� U.S. fleets, which are skewing toward larger vehicles, and national vehicle CO2 emissions standards to bolster its case for freezing vehicle emissions and mileage standards at current levels through 2026.Environmental groups and regulators in California and other states are fighting against any rollback in standards, saying tough rules are needed to address climate change and reduce consumer outlays for fuel.NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency are working to finalize as early as next month a rewrite of the Obama administration’s fuel efficiency requirements, which call for sharp reductions in fleet-wide emissions by 2026.Fiat Chrysler is paying fines for the shortfall in its domestic passenger car fleet, which includes several front-wheel Jeep and Dodge two-wheel drive SUVs and some sedans and muscle-cars. The automaker killed its slow-selling domestic small and midsize sedans.After paying $77.3 million last year for a 2016 model year fuel-economy shortfall, a Fiat Chrysler spokesman confirmed Wednesday the company had received a letter on the 2017 penalty and has 60 days to pay the fine.In its report, NHTSA said Fiat Chrysler - which reiterated plans Wednesday to spend $10 billion through 2022 to develop more than 30 hybrid and electric vehicles - had failed to meet the 2017 minimum “domestic passenger car�� requirements.The company said it “continues to support and deliver year-over-year fuel-economy improvements.”The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and others, said NHTSA's ""report shows continued progress and higher fuel economy across the entire fleet, but it also shows the continued gap between the standards and the market.“The Alliance continues to advocate for increased standards that are attainable and reflect marketplace realities,�� the lobbying group said in a statement.The Trump administration gave automakers another respite on fuel economy in July, when it cancelled a rule that would have more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements.Automakers protested the hike, saying it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually.Obama-era rules call for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026. That compares with 37 mpg under the Trump administration’s preferred option."	5.627068775
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth after sales in China were hit by a popular backlash against Japanese goods, and warned it could be February before business in the world's biggest autos market returns to normal.The cut, prompted by a slump in sales amid often violent protests in a dispute about ownership of islands in the East China Sea, makes it likely that bigger Japanese rival Nissan Motor 7201.T, and possibly Toyota Motor 7203.T, will follow suit when they report quarterly earnings early next week.“It’s likely Toyota and Nissan are going to cut forecasts in the same way. A cut was to be expected because the problems with China weren’t factored into forecasts,�� said Fujio Ando, managing director at Chibagin Asset Management.Demand for Honda, Toyota and Nissan cars slumped in China in September as tempers flared in the territorial dispute, with South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and Germany's BMW BMWG.DE picking up market share. Toyota has said its China sales dropped 49 percent in September.Sales by Honda and its China joint ventures dropped 40.5 percent last month. China is Honda’s second-biggest market after the United States, accounting for 17 percent of 2011 sales.Honda said on Monday that its two biggest China plants would continue to run on one shift, rather than two, until at least the middle of next month, with output then gradually picking up ahead of Chinese New Year in February - a traditional buying season. It cut its full-year China sales forecast by 17 percent to 620,000 vehicles, but said there would be no change to its investment there. Honda plans to invest $880 million to expand capacity at its plants in Guangzhou and Wuhan over the next few years.“China is the world’s biggest auto market and there’s no doubt it will continue to grow. We will continue our current (investment) plan,�� Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told a results briefing.Honda, whose models include the Accord, Fit/Jazz, Civic and CR-V, cut its net profit forecast for the year to March to 375 billion yen ($4.7 billion) from 470 billion yen. Last year, Honda reported net profit of 211.5 billion yen. It also cut its forecasts for annual operating profit and revenue, citing uncertain markets in China, Europe and India.Shares in Honda - which fell 15 percent to near 9-month lows amid the China protests - ended 4.7 percent lower at 2,399 yen, their biggest one-day fall in nearly 5 weeks.Honda released its quarterly earnings three hours earlier than planned, after accidentally posting the results on its website. It took down the numbers, but was told by the Tokyo Stock Exchange to bring forward the full announcement, a Honda spokeswoman said.Net profit for July-September rose 36.1 percent to 82.2 billion yen ($1.03 billion), some way below the average estimate of 107.2 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year ago, Japanese manufacturers were still reeling from the March earthquake and tsunami.Honda’s quarterly profits were also dented by start-up and advertising costs for the new Accord sedan, which went on sale in the United States in September, but the refresh helped Japan’s third-biggest automaker increase its share of the U.S. car and light truck market to 8.7 percent in September.The fallout from the Japan-China dispute could run into the current and fourth quarters, analysts have warned. Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said the impact could, at best, last 3 months, and up to 6 months in a pessimistic scenario.CEO Takanobu Ito, 59, an engineer who took charge three years ago, has set a demanding goal to nearly double global car sales to 6 million in four years. Worldwide production jumped 69 percent in April-September to above 2 million vehicles.The carmaker on Monday trimmed its full-year global sales forecast to 4.12 million vehicles from an earlier estimate of 4.3 million.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday completed a rollback of U.S. vehicle emissions standards adopted under his predecessor Barack Obama and will require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - far weaker than the 5% increases in the discarded rules.The announcement - condemned by Democrats and environmentalists while being lauded by Republicans and business interests - sets up a legal battle, with California and 22 other states planning to challenge the rewrite of what had been one of most ambitious U.S. policies aimed at combating climate change.The Trump administration called the move its largest single deregulatory action and said it would will save automakers upwards of $100 billion in compliance costs. The policy reversal marks the latest step by Trump, a Republican, to erase environmental policies pursued by Obama, a Democrat.James Owens, acting head of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the plan “strikes the right balance between environmental considerations, health and safety considerations and economic considerations.”Writing on Twitter, Trump said his administration was “helping U.S. auto workers by replacing the failed Obama Emissions Rule.�� Auto-producing states like Michigan could be pivotal in Trump’s Nov. 3 bid for re-election.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the administration’s decision will harm public health and endanger U.S. economic security.“The Trump administration’s anti-science decision to gut fuel standards will unleash massive amounts of pollution into the air at the worst possible time,�� Pelosi said, alluding to the coronavirus pandemic.A coalition of states previously challenged the Trump administration’s decision to revoke California’s authority to set its own stiff vehicle tailpipe emissions rules and require automakers under its Zero-Emission Vehicle Program to sell an increasing number of electric cars and trucks in the most populous U.S. state.Under the Obama-era rules, automakers were to have averaged about 5% per year increases in fuel efficiency through 2026, but the industry lobbied Trump to weaken them. The new requirements mean the U.S. vehicle fleet will average 40.4 miles per gallon rather than 46.7 mpg under the Obama rules.The Trump administration said the new rules will result in about 2 billion additional barrels of oil being consumed and 867 to 923 additional million metric tons of carbon dioxide being emitted and boost average consumer fuel costs by more than $1,000 per vehicle over the life of their vehicles.Obama’s environmental policies were intended to cut carbon emissions that drive climate change, while Trump has ditched numerous environmental regulations that his administration deemed harmful to industry and has aimed to increase the use of fossil fuels. Trump also has pulled the United States out of a global climate accord and moved to reverse clean water regulations and pollution standards for coal-burning power plants.California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols said her agency will move forward with its zero-emissions program.“This is a watershed moment marking the death of the old view of cars and emissions tied to petroleum use, and another that looks to vehicle technology driven by innovation,�� Nichols said.The Trump administration in August 2018 initially proposed freezing requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. Reuters reported in October automakers expected a 1.5% annual increase after talks with administration officials.A trade group that represents General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and others said automakers need policies that support ""a customer-friendly shift"" toward electrified and other highly efficient technologies. ""We are carefully reviewing the full breadth of this final rule to determine the extent to which it supports these priorities,"" it said.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business group, said the final rule provides a “workable path forward on a unified national program that provides regulatory certainty while strengthening fuel economy standards and continuing emissions reductions.�� Auto dealers also praised the revisions.The administration said the revised rules will cut the future price of new vehicles by around $1,000 and reduce traffic deaths. Environmentalists dispute that the rule will reduce traffic deaths. The administration said drivers will pay more in increased fuel costs than they will save in lower vehicle prices but concluded they will save more in overall vehicle ownership costs.The administration has battled with California over auto regulations. Last month, the U.S. Justice Department closed an antitrust investigation into a voluntary agreement between four automakers and California on emissions without taking any action.Ford Motor Co, BMW AG, Honda Motor Co and VW struck the deal last year, prompting the federal investigation. The deal bypassed a White House effort to strip California of the right to fight climate change and drew Trump’s ire. Volvo Cars confirmed on Tuesday it was also in talks to reach a California emissions agreement.Ford said on Tuesday it remains “committed to meeting emission reductions consistent with the California framework.��"	3.778596521
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Wednesday said it was recalling about 5.8 million cars at home and abroad over potentially faulty air bag inflators made by Takata Corp. 7312.T, including those used as replacement parts following a 2010 recall.Automakers worldwide are ramping up the industry’s biggest-ever recall after parts supplier Takata, under pressure from U.S. authorities, agreed earlier this year to declare more of its air bags as defective in the United States and other countries.The air bag inflators in question use a chemical compound which can explode with excessive force after prolonged exposure to hot conditions, and have been linked to at least 16 deaths globally, mainly in the United States.Toyota’s latest recall includes the Corolla, one of the world’s best-selling models, and the Vitz or Yaris subcompact hatchback model. It covers driver-side and passenger-side airbags installed in cars produced between May 2000 and November 2001, and April 2006 and December 2014, the company said in an email.It affects about 1.16 million vehicles sold in Japan, about 820,000 cars sold in China and around 1.47 million cars in the European market.The recall extends to Central and South America, Africa, the Near and Middle East and Singapore, and also includes the Hilux pick-up truck and the Etios line of sedans and hatchbacks.The move shows the complicated nature of the inflator recall, which began around 2008 and continues to expand.The latest recall includes about 20,000 cars which were fitted with replacement Takata inflators following an initial 2010 recall, as the replacement parts are also seen to be at risk of exploding as they do not contain a drying agent.Transport authorities around the world now consider inflators without a drying agent to be unsafe, and have ordered all of them to be withdrawn.Since global transportation authorities expanded their recall from May, about 100 million Takata air bag inflators have been classified as defective worldwide.Takata is seeking a financial investor to help pay for huge liabilities from the recall, and has been meeting with potential sponsors and automaker clients to discuss its survival options.	1.991341991
(The August 22 story corrects paragraph 7 to clarify Bellsonica makes auto framework parts and adds co response.)NEW DELHI (Reuters) - With India’s auto sales declining for the ninth straight month in July, more automotive manufacturers are laying off workers and temporarily halting production to keep costs in check, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor 7203.T and South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS are the latest in a string of companies to briefly halt some parts of production at plants to combat slumping sales, according to company memos to employees, reviewed by Reuters.Passenger vehicle sales in July fell at the fastest pace in nearly two decades. The sales declines have triggered major job cuts in India’s auto sector, with many companies forced to shut down factories for days and axe shifts.Sources have told Reuters that even more companies have now begun to lay off temporary workers as the slowdown worsens.Denso Corp's 6902.T India unit, which makes powertrain and air-conditioning systems for cars, has cut some temporary workers at its Manesar plant in north India, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. A spokeswoman for Denso said the information was incorrect and declined to elaborate further. In a separate email, another company official disputed that the firm employed temporary workers at its Manesar plant.Bellsonica, which is part-owned by India's biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and makes auto framework parts, has also let more than 350 workers go in Manesar, two sources said.In an email, Bellsonica said the workers that had been let go were temporary workers, and most had been let go earlier in the year.Reuters earlier this month reported automakers, component manufacturers and dealers had already cut 350,000 jobs.In a meeting with India’s finance ministry on Aug. 7, industry executives asked for tax cuts, and easier access to finance for dealers and buyers, in an effort to revive sales.Toyota, in a notice dated Aug. 13, told its workers the company would halt production at its plants in Bengaluru in southern India on Aug. 16 and 17 “due to low market demand of vehicles�� and high stock of about 7,000 vehicles.N. Raja, deputy managing director, at Toyota’s India unit, told Reuters that while the company had a flexible production system it had to resort to five no-production days in August to prevent the build up of stock.“The industry is deeply concerned with the reality of poor customer sentiment faced by the sector,�� said Raja, adding he hoped the government would step in to support the industry.Hyundai, in a memo on Aug. 9, also said it would halt production for several days in August across various departments including the body shop and paint shop as well as its engine and transmission plants.A Hyundai Motor India spokesman said the company expected sales to pick up in the festive season starting next month and added that the company had not laid off any workers.	6.680747868

(The following was released by the rating agency)JAKARTA/TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, March 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Indonesia-based PT Toyota Astra Financial Services (TAFS) a National Long-Term Rating of ‘AAA(idn)�� with a Stable Outlook.The agency has also assigned TAFS’s proposed senior bond II 2012 of maximum IDR1.5trn a National Long-Term Rating of ‘AAA(idn)��. The bond has a maturity of up to four years. The proceeds from the proposed issue will be used to support the company’s business growth.TAFS’s ratings reflect strong support from Toyota Financial Services Corporation (TFSC), one of its two major shareholders. TFSC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC; ‘A��/Stable), one of the biggest automotive manufacturers in the world. As part of the Toyota group, TAFS benefits from product knowledge-sharing and funding support. The latter is derived from TMC’s strong relationship with Japanese banks and Japanese government-backed financial institutions.TAFS also benefits from support from Astra International (AI), the other major shareholder, in operations, infrastructure (IT system), networks (dealership chains) and human resources. AI is a leading car distributor in Indonesia and holds exclusive rights for Toyota sales in the country. AI has another subsidiary that also engages in Toyota car sales but Fitch does not believe this to be an issue for TAFS. This is because the latter has helped lift Toyota’s credit market share in Indonesia to 70% in 2011 from 40% before TAFS was established.TAFS’s financing receivables increased to IDR11trn in 2011 from IDR2.3trn in 2007. It won greater market share in 2011 to account for about 30% of Toyota car credit sales, although they are still a new player in the industry. Fitch also notes that the strong growth was sponsored by capital support from its major shareholders.Its debt to equity ratio (DER) increased to 8x in 2011 - the company’s internal threshold - from 7.9x in 2010, mainly due to additional debt incurred for loan expansion. As a result TAFS expects capital injection of IDR150bn in March 2012 from both shareholders to fund business growth.Being a captive finance company that only focuses on new car financing, TAFS’s profitability is lower than that of peers that engage in new and used car financing. Return on asset (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) stood at 2% and 18.7% respectively in 2011. TAFS’s asset quality remains manageable, although non-performing loans (NPL) increased to 0.4% in 2011 and 2010 (2009: 0.1%) due to business expansion outside Java. Hence, write-offs and losses on repossessed assets also increased. Fitch believes pressure on asset quality will persist in line with business growth, particularly outside Java. However, TAFS has tightened financing criteria since 2011 and maintained adequate reserves in anticipation of the rise in non-performing loans.The rating may come under pressure from a decline in Toyota’s ownership and diminished support from both its shareholders.TAFS was established by Toyota Financial Services Corporation (TFSC) to support Toyota car sales in Indonesia. It is equally owned by Toyota Group and Astra Group.	-0.3261657405
BEIJING, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor said on Thursday it aims to sell more than 1 million cars in China this year, growing over 10 percent from the previous year after sales rose 4 percent in 2011.The Japanese automaker sold about 883,000 cars in China in 2011.Sales in Greater China, including Hong Kong and Macau, came to 895,000 cars last year, close to its target of 900,000 cars despite parts supply shortages in the wake of the devastating March earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand, it said.Toyota operates car manufacturing ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group, respectively.	13.42869654

TOKYO, June 15 (Reuters) - Three foreign funds on Monday said they would oppose Toyota Motor Corp’s proposal to issue a new class of shares, joining an influential California pension fund in objecting to a sale that critics say favours Japanese retail investors.Toyota aims to sell “Model AA�� shares, named after its first passenger car, to attract long-term investors. Unlike common shares, they are unlisted and will be sold only in Japan, meaning foreign investors will have to buy them through intermediaries.The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Florida State Board of Administration, and Ontario Teachers�� Pension Plan will vote against the plan at Toyota’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, the U.S. Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds and endowments, said in a newsletter.Toyota said it could not immediately comment.The automaker has registered to issue up to 50 million Model AA shares for as much as 500 billion yen ($4.05 billion), earmarking the funds raised for long-term product development.The shares must be held for five years after which holders can convert them into common stock or have Toyota buy them back at their issue price.The latest opposition comes a week after the California State Teachers�� Retirement System, the second-largest U.S. public pension fund, said it would vote against the plan because the sale would essentially be closed to foreign investors.It also comes as a new corporate governance code takes effect in Japan, encouraging investors to voice concerns and forcing companies to consider the views of those who vote against management-backed proposals.Toyota needs a two-thirds majority at its annual general meeting to pass the plan.But the vote would likely be close because around 30 percent of Toyota shares are held by foreign investors, finance industry executives told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media on the matter.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it would recall more than 7.4 million vehicles worldwide as a faulty power window switch was a potential fire hazard, the latest in a series of setbacks for Japan's biggest automaker.Toyota has battled its way back from multiple difficulties since 2008, including a series of recalls involving more than 10 million of its vehicles in 2009-11, and supply chains crippled by the tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand.Below are details of some other recent major recalls.March 2012 - BMW BMWG.DE says it is recalling about 1.3 million cars for repair worldwide due to a possible problem with a battery cable cover in the trunk. The recall affects 5- and 6-Series BMWs built between 2003 and 2010.September 2011 - Honda 7267.T says it will recall about 960,000 Fit subcompacts and other models globally to repair defects including malfunctioning power window switches.May 2011 - Honda expands earlier recalls of Honda and Acura vehicles over airbags that could deploy with too much pressure, causing injuries or fatalities, adding more than 833,000 vehicles from model years 2001-2003. This is the fourth time Honda has widened its airbag recall, first announced in 2008. The number of vehicles affected is now 1.65 million.January 2011 - Toyota says it will recall more than 1.7 million vehicles worldwide, bringing its total for recalls to nearly 16 million since late 2009 and dealing a blow to its efforts to restore its reputation for quality.October 2010 - Toyota will recall a total of about 1.66 million vehicles, mostly in Japan, the United States and China, for problems involving brakes and fuel pumps.October 2010 - BMW voluntarily recalls 350,000 cars worldwide due to possible brake problems. The problem affects brand 5, 6 and 7 Series models built since 2002.August 2010 - Toyota recalls 1.3 million Corolla and Matrix cars from 2005-2008 model years in the United States and Canada.June 2010 - GM GM.N announces the recall of 1.5 million trucks, crossovers and cars from model years 2006-2009 as the unit that heats the windshield washer fluid could catch fire.March 2010 - GM says it is recalling 1.3 million compact cars covering the 2005-2010 model year Chevrolet Cobalt and 2007-2010 Pontiac G5 in the U.S.; the 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada; and the 2005-2006 Pontiac G4 sold in Mexico.January 2010 - Toyota issues a series of recalls covering 5.6 million vehicles in the United States due to sudden acceleration in some vehicles.	3.80761523
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to buy a $1 billion stake in Southeast Asia’s Grab in the biggest investment by a carmaker into a ride-hailing firm, at a time when traditional automakers are racing to team up with disruptive tech companies.The value of six-year-old Grab will be just over $10 billion after the investment, said a person familiar with the matter.The deal comes as the auto industry faces a spike in the need for technological prowess with the advent of features such as autonomous driving, while app makers offer passengers the option to forgo car purchases by connecting them with drivers.Some automakers have responded by partnering with makers of ride-hailing apps which dominate the fast-growing field of mobility services, in anticipation of a future of reduced car ownership.General Motors Co has invested in U.S. ride services firm Lyft, whose rival Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] is also backed by Toyota. Meanwhile Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp - also an investor in Grab and Uber - last month said it would invest $2.25 billion in GM’s autonomous vehicle unit Cruise.Toyota’s trading arm invested an undisclosed sum in Grab last year. This time, the automaker is lead investor in a financing round launched after Grab acquired Uber’s operations in Southeast Asia, a region of 640 million people.Grab called it the largest-ever investment globally by an automotive manufacturer in the ride-hailing sector.The Singapore-headquartered firm did not disclose how much fresh capital it aims to raise. It raised $2.5 billion in its last round in July, resulting in a reported value of $6 billion.Grab said it logs six million rides a day via apps downloaded onto over 100 million mobile devices. The firm also offers online to offline services, such as food delivery and digital payments, which it aims to expand deeper into the region using funds from its latest financing round.“We will work with partners like Toyota to continue to transform transportation in Southeast Asia,�� Grab said in an email. “We want to be the one-stop mobility platform for users.”It also said Toyota will appoint an executive to Grab’s board of directors while a dedicated Toyota team member will be seconded to Grab as an executive officer.Toyota said it aimed to offer financing, insurance and maintenance services to drivers based on data collected through recorder devices already installed in some Grab vehicles.“Going forward, together with Grab, we will develop services that are more attractive, safe and secure for our customers in Southeast Asia,�� Toyota executive Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement.The data could also help Toyota develop its own next-generation mobility services, including a self-driving electric vehicle aimed at companies for use in tasks such as ride hailing, package delivery and mobile shops.Other Grab investors include Japan’s Honda Motor Co Ltd, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing. Uber acquired 27.5 percent of Grab in exchange for the U.S. firm’s Southeast Asian business earlier this year.Grab’s main rival is now Indonesia’s Go-Jek which last month said it would invest $500 million to begin expanding abroad.	-4.357137582

* Japan firms fail to make significant inroads in Europe* South Korea’s Hyundai, Kia boost sales, market sharePARIS, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers, battered by a strong yen, are hunkering down in a stormy Europe, taking tentative steps to stand up to their aggressive South Korean rivals, in a market they see as challenging, but worth the effort.All Japanese carmakers�� sales declined in Western Europe in the eight months to August from a year ago, ranging from Toyota Motor Corp’s 0.9 percent dip to Mitsubishi Motors�� 34.5 percent tumble.That compares with South Korean Hyundai Motor’s 9.3 percent rise and its affiliate Kia Motors�� 25.1 percent jump, as aggressive marketing of their stylish, affordable cars paid off, helped by a weak won and a free trade agreement between South Korea and the European Union.Hyundai’s market share grew to 3.2 percent in western Europe through August from 1.8 percent in 2007, while Kia’s rose to 2.4 percent from 1.5 percent.“It’s a tough region for Japanese companies to do well, and also if we use cars from Japan, of course it’s very difficult in terms of export,�� Karl Schlicht, Executive Vice President of Toyota Motor Europe said ahead of the Paris auto show, which opened to the media on Thursday.So why do Japanese carmakers bother?In fact, some don’t - Daihatsu, part of the Toyota group, will stop selling new cars in Europe in January 2013, blaming the high costs needed to meet Europe’s tough environmental regulations and the strong yen.But for many automakers, Europe’s tough regulatory requirements are part of the answer.“This is where all global standards for cars are set. If we don’t fight here, we can’t fight anywhere else,�� Hiroshi Harunari, Executive Vice President of Mitsubishi, told Reuters this week.Executives cited standards such as the European Union’s Euro 5 and Euro 6, which cap permissible emissions from various kinds of vehicles.The European market may be struggling as austerity measures, high unemployment and fears about the future keep customers away from showrooms, but it still represents a major chunk of global auto sales.The 27 EU member states accounted for 19 percent of worldwide motor vehicle registrations - or 15.1 million vehicles - in 2011, data published on the website of European industry association ACEA shows.At a tough time for the region, Japanese automakers can count themselves lucky their presence in Europe is limited, said Christopher Richter, a senior analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific markets based in Tokyo.“Their exposure to the region, compared to the state of the German makers or the American makers, is very small. And given the state of economy and the state of the vehicle market there, that’s not such a bad thing.”Despite their decades-long presence, most Japanese carmakers have failed to make significant inroads in the highly competitive market, which is dominated by western brands such as Volkswagen, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault and Ford.The exception is Nissan Motor Co, which has an alliance with Renault, receiving diesel engines and manual transmissions popular in Europe from the French firm. It is the only major Japanese carmaker whose market share has grown in western Europe in the last five years.It rose to 3.4 percent in 2012 from 2.0 percent in 2007.Nissan also produces about 80 percent of products sold in Europe within the region, a higher rate than that of Toyota at around 67 percent and Honda at 60 percent.Japanese firms suffered as the yen soared to about 77 yen against a dollar from 120 yen five years ago, making it more expensive to export from Japan. Supply chains were also disrupted by the 2011 Japan earthquake and Thai floods.Honda Motor, whose market share in Western Europe shrank to 1.0 percent in 2012 from 1.9 percent five years ago, has seen its European business lose money for three years in a row and is not optimistic about a quick recovery.Toyota, whose market share dropped to 4.2 percent from 5.8 percent in 2007, brought its European business back to profit two years ago thanks to its financial services business.In common with its peers, one of its strategies to help European operations is reducing reliance on imports. Toyota is investing $350 million to build the new Auris compact hatchback in Britain and the Corolla in Turkey.“It’s very easy to lose money here in Europe. So we have to be careful and we want to go step by step, said Toyota’s Schlicht. “There is no bravado or nobody is saying we need to do crazy things in Europe.”Toyota aims to start making money this year in European car manufacturing.Nissan is investing 900 million pounds ($1.45 billion) in projects at its Sunderland plant in Britain, including production of the Qashqai crossover, Note compact car, and the LEAF electric vehicle.Meanwhile, Mitsubishi agreed to sell a plant in the Netherlands for 1 euro to a local bus maker on condition that employees did not lose their jobs, taking care of a sluggish operation that had troubled it for years.The carmaker will start selling the Outlander SUV and the Mirage compact car in Europe soon.“We are currently on the defensive, but as we introduce new products into the market, we will also be on the offensive,�� said Mitsubishi’s Harunari. “We shouldn’t be pessimistic.��	-1.324672016
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the former head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, on Wednesday lamented the failure of the carmakers to merge with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), which has since combined with Peugeot (PSA).Speaking publicly for the first since his dramatic escape from Japan at the end of 2019, Ghosn told reporters in Beirut that he had been in negotiations with John Elkann, a member of Fiat’s owning family.“In 2017, the alliance was the number one automotive group. Three companies growing, profitable. We were preparing to add Fiat Chrysler to the group because I was negotiating with John Elkann for Fiat Chrysler to join,�� he said.“I had contact with FCA. We had a lot of understanding, we have very good dialogue. Unfortunately, I was arrested before we could come to a conclusion,�� Ghosn said, adding that a meeting had been scheduled for January 2019 to try to conclude a deal.Renault-Nissan has been in management turmoil ever since Ghosn’s arrest in Tokyo in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies. He was awaiting trial in Japan when he fled to Lebanon.Fiat Chrysler and Renault did announce a $35 billion plan to merge in May 2019, when Ghosn was in detention, but the Italian-American company pulled out only 10 days after the deal was made public.The Renault-Nissan alliance has struggled to move on since the collapse of the deal, which would have created the third biggest carmaker behind Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Toyota.“The alliance missed the unmissable, which is Fiat Chrysler. That is unbelievable, they go with PSA. How can you miss that huge opportunity to become the dominant player in the industry?�� Ghosn said. “Who is the winner of all this?”�It’s a great opportunity for PSA, it’s a big waste for Renault,�� said Ghosn.	0.5480037008
* Banks, insurers outperform on rising U.S. yields* Toyota and SoftBank partner on self-driving technologyTOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei dropped to a one-week low on Thursday as investors took profits after a recent rally lifted the index to a 27-year high, but Toyota and SoftBank rose after they announced a partnership on auto driving technology.Analysts said sentiment soured late in the session due to weakness in Asian shares on worries about rising borrowing costs and to indications of a fall later in New York, with eMini futures for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow e-minis both down 0.5 percent.The Nikkei share average ended 0.6 percent lower at 23,975.62, its weakest close since Sept. 27, as market participants reckoned the benchmark had been overbought in the recent rally.“Asian shares were overall weak on the back of a strong dollar and rising U.S. yields, but the Japanese market’s downside was somewhat supported by the weaker yen,�� said Masashi Oda, general manager at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.Oda said that the weak yen should raise prospects for Japan Inc to post stronger-than-expected earnings, but given the recent rally, it was natural to see profit-taking.The Nikkei has traded more than 5 percent above its 25-day moving average recently, a sign the market is overbought.Index-heavyweight stock Fast Retailing, which rose 2 percent last week, fell 0.9 percent on profit-taking, taking a hefty 20 points off the Nikkei.Toyota Motor Corp bucked the weakness, rising 0.6 percent after it and SoftBank Group Corp said they will team up to develop car services that rely on self-driving technology.SoftBank rose 1.3 percent.Honda Motor Co added 0.2 percent after saying it will invest $2.75 billion and take a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co’s Cruise self-driving vehicle unit, to jointly develop autonomous vehicles for ride services fleets around the world.Analysts said that the weak yen is serving as a tailwind for the auto sector as the dollar traded at 114.55 yen, its highest since early November 2017.The upbeat U.S. economy is supporting the dollar, particularly after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank may raise interest rates above an estimated “neutral�� setting as the “remarkably positive�� U.S. economy continues to grow.Insurers and banks, which hunt for higher-yielding products such as U.S. bonds, soared after U.S. Treasury yields jumped to multi-year peaks.Dai-ichi Life Holdings surged 3.4 percent and T&amp;D Holdings climbed 3.8 percent.

CHONBURI Thailand (Reuters) - Thailand’s second military coup in a decade will not scare off foreign car firms, who still prize its skilled labor force and network of parts suppliers, but expansion plans are on hold after months of unrest as Indonesia lures some investment away.The auto industry accounts for about 11 percent of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, and most of the big global players use the country as a regional hub.“That will not change,�� said Takao Katagiri, Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s regional chief. “There is a strong foundation there including the supplier network. That’s not something that can be changed so easily.”In the short term, the turmoil that prompted the army to seize power in a bid to end seven months of sometimes violent street protests has not changed much for the big car makers, who are likely to export around half the cars they make in Thailand this year.“What is happening now has not had a direct impact on actual livelihoods and corporate activities. Manufacturing is operating smoothly and our sales and business operations are going on as usual today,�� Katagiri said.Smaller players in the supply chain are suffering more, due to the damage the unrest has inflicted on domestic demand. Auto parts maker Aapico Hitech Plc said on Thursday its 2014 revenue would fall 10-15 percent, worse than earlier forecast.At the sprawling Amata Nakorn industrial estate at Chonburi, 60 km east of Bangkok, 30-year-old Rungsan Seagproa said he had suffered a drop in his 19,000 baht-a-month ($580) salary after the auto parts supplier he works for cut back on production.“The factory is running at around 30-40 percent,�� said the assembly worker. “I lost about a few thousand baht after the company cut the overtime shift. Now, I need to be careful about spending.”At least 30,000 subcontracted workers in the auto sector have been laid off because of the slowdown this year.“COUP BEATS DYSFUNCTIONAL GOVERNMENT”Scores of politicians were detained for a while after the coup and censorship imposed, but some Thais welcomed the relative calm and the return of functioning government. One Toyota executive familiar with the country agreed.“We’ll take an orderly coup d’etat any time over a highly dysfunctional democracy that led to a gap in political leadership in Thailand over the past six months,�� he said.Car industry executives say the mood in Thailand was morose even before the coup.Domestic vehicle sales had surged a heady 80 percent in 2012 to 1.44 million vehicles, fueled by a state subsidy for first-time car buyers that was part of government efforts to boost the economy after floods devastated great swathes of Thailand in 2011, including huge industrial parks in the central provinces.That couldn’t last, and sales fell nearly 8 percent to 1.33 million in 2013, according to the Federation of Thai Industries. Toyota Motor Corp has forecast a further drop of 14 percent this year as political turmoil has pushed consumer confidence to a 12-year low.It is not just the auto industry that is suffering because of the unrest. Figures on Wednesday showed factory output was lower than a year before for the 13th consecutive month in April and capacity utilization in industry stood at just 56.6 percent, the lowest since the peak of the flooding in December 2011.Imports were 14.5 percent lower than a year before as the domestic economy stagnated and exports continued to struggle, down 0.9 percent compared with April 2013. [ID:nL3N0OC0YT]Thailand’s car sector is suffering from longer-term problems, too, including a shortage of labor and wages that are higher than elsewhere in the region.Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association head Fumihiko Ike, who is chairman of Honda Motor Co Ltd, said car makers were starting to look at Indonesia and India, both of which have vast long-term growth potential.Indonesia is a second Southeast Asian hub for Toyota Motor, the world’s biggest car maker, but it can’t match Thailand as a manufacturing base, an Indonesian-based Toyota executive said.“In terms of parts supply infrastructure and human resources, Indonesia isn’t that sophisticated as yet and cannot compete well with Thailand as a place to operate all aspects of the business, from product development to manufacturing to sales and marketing,�� he said.Shingo Ikeda, a Singapore-based expert on Southeast Asia’s automotive industry with Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, said, judged by the number of parts suppliers, Thailand’s auto industry was around three times the size of Indonesia’s, which he reckoned would take around a decade to catch up.“It’s very hard to switch investment from Thailand to Indonesia,�� Ikeda said. “As an automotive hub in Southeast Asia in the shorter term Thailand is very, very strong because of this huge supplier base.”Thailand’s Hemaraj Land Development Pcl has attracted the likes of Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co plus many parts firms to its five industrial states.“Infrastructure like power, communications, ports, other than road bottlenecks, are very good. There is an excellent automotive supplier base, labor and production costs are reasonable, and the ease of business is favorable in Thailand,�� said David Nardone, its managing director.To be sure, Japanese firms have pulled in their horns in Thailand, and politics has been a factor.Honda said on May 22, hours before the coup, that it had cut output at one plant to 60 percent of capacity. It is delaying the start-up of a new plant by up to a year from April 2015, according to company officials in Thailand, but may reconsider if demand picks up.Toyota said back in January it could reconsider planned investment of up to 20 billion baht ($609 million) in Thailand or even cut production if political unrest dragged on.But the Japanese car makers have been in Thailand for decades and have already invested heavily in manufacturing capacity in the country that cannot be easily shifted.“We don’t have any plans right now to expand capacity over and above that which is already built. So we don’t have any difficult decisions to make,�� said Andy Palmer, chief planning officer at Nissan, which is opening a second Thai plant soon.“If this was happening two years ago, that might be a different situation. One might pause and think, but right now we are already pregnant. The baby is coming whether you like it or not.�� ($1 = 32.7100 Thai Baht)	5.790823093
* EVs to make up only 1.5 pct of US market in 2017-analyst* Henry Ford bought his wife electric cars* Obama wants to boost consumer EV subsidies by a thirdDETROIT, March 21 (Reuters) - Scott Kluth has a love-hate relationship with his new Fisker Karma luxury electric sedan.The 34-year-old car lover bought the plug-in hybrid electric Karma in December for $107,850, but five days later the car’s battery died as he was driving in downtown Chicago. While the car he affectionately calls a “head turner�� was fixed in a recall, Klut h remains uncertain how much he will drive it.“I just want a car that works,�� Kluth said. “It’s a fun car to drive. It’s just that I’ve lost confidence in it.”The Karma’s problems -- one vehicle died during testing by Consumer Reports this month -- f ollow bad publicity arising from a probe of General Motors Co’s Chevrolet Volt and weak sales of the car, and the closure or bankruptcy of several electric vehicle-related start-ups.The unrelenting bad news has led to questions about the readiness of electric cars and raises fresh doubts about a technology that has around since the late 1890s but still struggling to win over the public.Whether electric vehicles can find an audience beyond policymakers in Washington and Hollywood celebrities depends on lowering vehicle prices wi thout selling cars at a loss, an alysts and industry executives say, whi le ext ending driving range to make the cars competitive with their gasoline-powered peers.“It’s going to be a slow slog,�� said John O’Dell, senior green car editor a t industry research firm E dmunds.com. “Maybe there’s too much expectation of more and quicker success than might realistically be expected of a brand new technology.”He also questioned whether priorities will simply change for whomever is U.S. president after the November election. Electric v ehicles could lose tax breaks -- currently worth $7,500 a vehicle for buyers -- particularly if a Republican ends up in the White House.Edmunds expects pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids to make up only 1.5 percent of the U.S. market in 2017, compared with 0.1 percent last year, and O’Dell said that may be optimistic. Consumers charge all-electric cars by plugging into an outlet, while hybrid versions include a gasoline engine.President Barack Obama’s administration has been a strong proponent of e lectric vehicles l ike the Volt and set a goal of getting 1 million battery-powered vehicles on the road by 2015. Lux Research estimates that number will actually be fewer than 200,000. Both the Volt and Karma’s development were supported by low-interest federal loans.That has not dissuaded automakers, many of which plan to launch electric vehicles to j oin the Volt and Nissan’s all-electric Leaf in a bid to meet rising fuel efficiency standards. Toyota has begun selling a plug-in Prius, and EVs from Ford, Honda, BMW and Fiat will join the fray this year, along with cars from start-ups Tesla and Coda Automotive.Electric cars aren’t a new concept. Henry Ford bought his wife, Clara, at least two electric cars in the early 1900s offering at best 50 miles driving range and top speeds of about 35 miles per hour, according to the Henry Ford Museum.But analysts said automakers have not done a good enough job getting the costs down and explaining the technology to win over anyone beyond early adopters like actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pop idol Justin Bieber, comedian Jay Leno and former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.“You can do all the advertising and promotion you want, but if people don’t buy into the message the needle’s not going to move,�� said George Cook, a marketing professor at the University of Rochester’s business school and a former Ford executive.The Volt, at almost $40,000 before federal subsidies, is seen as too expensive by many critics. Fiat-Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, a long-time EV skeptic, has said Chrysler will lose more than $10,000 on every battery-powered Fiat 500 it sells.And even with rising gasoline prices -- topping $4 a gallon in parts of the country -- EVs a re just n ot competitive, according to the Lundberg Survey. Gasoline prices would have to rise to $8.53 a gallon to make the Leaf competitive and hit $12.50 for a Volt to be worth it, base d on the cost of gasoline versus electricity, fuel efficiency and depreciation, the s urvey said.Obama’s vision, which he laid out at a Daimler truck plant in North Carolina this month, includes a car battery that costs half the price of today’s versions and can go up to 300 miles on a single charge. The industry is far from achieving that.Since last fall, there has been a run of bad news for EVs, starting with the late November news t hat U.S. safety regulators were investigating the Volt for possible battery fires.While the federal investigation was closed with the conclusion there was no defect and the car did not pose a greater risk of fire than gas-powered vehicles, weak demand led GM to halt production for five weeks and temporarily lay off 1,300 workers at the plant that builds the car. GM, which strengthened the structural protection of the Volt battery, has repeatedly said the car is safe, and some said t he safety probe should have never occurred.The Karma that died during testing by Consumer Reports magazine was another blow following a recall of more than 200 o f the cars la st year and the halting of sales in January for a software issue. Fis ker, which builds the Karma in Finland, also suspended work last month at its U.S. plant scheduled to make another car, the Nina sedan, whi le it works to renegotiate a $529 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy.Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher said problems can arise with new technologies and a new company but added Fisker had gone “beyond the call of duty�� in instituting a system to respond to customer issues and had plenty of satisfied owners. CEO Tom LaSorda in a letter to Karma owners last week said Fisker was committed to giving customers “complete peace of mind�� and he had created a “SWAT team�� of 50 engineers and consultants to identify issues with the car.‘FIRST LAW OF DISNEY’�The expectations have always been too high for electric cars,�� said Bill Reinert, Toyota’s U.S. manager for advanced technology. “The realities have always been clouded by the dreams. I like to say it’s the first law of thermodynamics versus the first law of Disney. Disney is wishing it w ill be so. It do esn’t work.�� Toyota has always been skeptical EVs would quickly boost its share of the auto market.Meanwhile, several companies have struggled due to lack of funding or customer troubles.A123 Systems posted a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss this month after Fisker, one of its largest customers, cut battery orders. Bright Automotive, an Indiana electric commercial truck start-up, closed its doors in February after failing to get a federal loan.Ener1 Inc, which received a $118.5 million federal grant to make lithium-ion batteries for EVs, filed for bankruptcy in January, and Aptera Motors, a California-based EV start-up, went out of business last December after it couldn’t raise $80 million in private funding.“There will be more companies that fail, but it’s no different than Internet companies,�� said Kristen Helsel, vice president of EV solutions for AeroVironment, which makes EV charging stations for BMW, Mitsubishi and Nissan. “People with the right business model are going to do fine.”A number of top national retail chains, including Kohl’s and Walgreen, have begun installing charging stations at their stores, bu t critics say the U.S. push for electric cars has come before such infrastructure is in place, weakening the case for consumers to be attracted to the technology.But since the bankruptcy of Solyndra, a solar panel maker that received $535 million in U.S. loan guarantees, federal support for advanced vehicle technology programs has ground to a halt. Ind ustry officials and analysts point to tightened U.S. Department of Energy requirements in the face of withering criticism from Republicans about the Obama administration’s generosity for anything related to green technology.“There was certainly a different energy level one year ago, even two years ago,�� said Oliver Hazimeh, sustainable transportation practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. “This year, it just had a different drumbeat.�� Hazimeh sees long-term demand for EVs rising to up to 9 percent of the global market by 2022, but h e predicts there will be some setbacks along the way.Obama wants to increase the tax subsidies for buyers of electric vehicles to $10,000 per vehicle from the current $7,500. Bu t c ritics say the small EV sales totals tell the real story.Complicating matters, automakers continue to squeeze increased fuel efficiency out of the internal combustion engine. That makes it tougher to make EV sticker prices attractive enough to put a dent in the traditional gasoline-powered vehicles�� domi nation of the market. [ID: nN1E7AE04G]The EV’s industry’s struggles have vindicated the more deliberate approach taken by Toyota, Ford and C hrysler’s M archionne, who killed plans for a Chrysler electric car, analysts said.Still, proponents say electric-car sales will grow just like Toyota’s hybrid Prius rose from about 5,500 in its U.S. debut in 2000 to a peak of more than 180,000 in 2007.Doug Parks, GM’s chief Volt engineer, said the proof is in the large amounts of money automakers are spending on EV technology development.“Follow the money. People are investing huge in this stuff,�� h e said. �� This is a 10- or 20-year discussion and we’ve been selling the Volt for a year.”GM, which recently launched a new advertising campaign centered on testimonials by adoring Volt owners, has made the car the centerpiece of efforts to seize from Toyota the mantle as the world’s greenest automaker. Meanwhile, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has estimated pure electric vehicles like the Leaf will make up 10 percent of industry global sales by 2020.Time will tell if that’s wishful thinking.“It’s been the Kool-Aid that the entire political system has been drinking for a decade,�� said Bob Martin, a senior consultant with auto product development firm The CarLab. “Electric cars are not ready for prime time. They’re really interesting toys for very, very rich people.��	-4.073368271
TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - By pumping $1 billion into ride-hailing firm Grab, Toyota Motor Corp stands to gain a passenger-side view of tens of thousands of cars across Southeast Asia, tracking how fast they drive, how far they travel and the time they spend stuck in traffic.The Japanese automaker said it aims to install its TransLog driving recorder devices into Grab’s fleet of lease cars to access the data on driving patterns that will be crucial to its push into the nascent mobility-as-a-service industry.“Only ride-hailing companies have good, extensive data on usage, so automakers want to be connected with that,�� said Egil Juliussen, director of research for automotive infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems at IHS Markit.Grab already monitors driving behavior through its app to increase ride safety, sending emails about speed and braking, for instance, to its drivers, such as Singapore’s Rennu Mahajan.“With this system, it keeps me in check,�� said Mahajan, 57.It will get even more vehicle data with Toyota, which has been harvesting data through TransLog since 2016 in sales and trials with taxi firms and car-hailing operators including Grab. The data gives Toyota insight into fleet management as it develops services including futuristic concepts such as pay-per-use mobile restaurants.The latest deal, announced last week, gives Toyota access to a single pool of vehicles which potentially eclipses all others. That will allow it to capture a volume of data that would be difficult to collect from private cars which are only used for under 5 percent of any given day, often on routine commutes.In return, Grab will be able to expand services such as food delivery and digital payments using Toyota’s $1 billion investment - the biggest by a traditional automaker in a ride-sharing app maker.The deal reflects how automakers are clamoring for access to ride-hailing firms�� extensive user bases through a spate of partnerships, as they compete with technology companies to develop autonomous cars and next-generation transport services.Toyota’s vision of such services includes convoys of shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles used, for instance, as pay-per-use mobile restaurants and hotels, which the automaker plans to develop and customize for retail customers.“There’s data about the car, and then there’s also data about the service - how many customers drivers have, what’s the average mileage, where the rides are concentrated,�� said Juliussen. “Having that picture in all the major (Southeast Asian) cities, that becomes very valuable.”Toyota and Grab will be able to use the data for possible collaboration on data-driven services such as vehicle diagnostics and customized insurance plans based on driver usage.The data will also help Grab maintain efficiency in fleet maintenance as it expands deeper into Southeast Asia where it operates in over 200 cities. It has said it wants build the region’s largest car rental fleet by the fourth quarter of 2018.“Vehicle maintenance costs, insurance costs, these are bread-and-butter issues for ride-hailing drivers,�� said Chua Kee Lock, chief executive of Vertex Venture Holdings in Singapore, an early Grab investor.Industry experts said Toyota could expand its data service to more mobility firms such as Didi Chuxing, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Amazon.com Inc, with which it has separate partnerships.“This partnership with Toyota will keep Grab’s platform ��sticky�� and give drivers less incentive to switch to competitors,�� said Chua. “This is Grab’s edge over the long-run.��	-0.7010402533
TOKYO/MARYSVILLE (Reuters) - Japan’s top automakers are shuffling their U.S. product portfolios and resorting to larger imports of popular models there as they scramble to meet booming demand for gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks in the world’s No. 2 auto market.Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Japan's third-largest automaker, said it will begin producing from early next year the Acura MDX SUV at its plant in East Liberty, Ohio, adding to production at its Alabama plant, which also makes its Pilot SUV, Ridgeline pick-up truck and Odyssey minivan. Honda, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T are all trying to maximize production efficiency at their North American plants to squeeze out more SUVs, but Toyota and Nissan have been importing a large number of SUV models to make up for the production shortfall, and Honda may do the same.“It takes time for manufacturing to catch up to these shifts because automakers are committing to changing their portfolio. It’s not something you can do quickly,�� said Rebecca Lindland, senior analyst for automotive research company Kelley Blue Book.Imports allow car makers to sell more cars in a region without raising local production capacity, but they also can increase foreign exchange risks.Historically low U.S. gasoline prices and cost-conscious consumers seeking multi-tasking vehicles have boosted sales of SUVs, particularly smaller crossover models, and trucks, denting demand for traditionally sought-after passenger cars.Currently, 59 percent of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. market are light trucks, versus 41 percent passenger cars, compared with 55 percent and 45 percent, respectively, a year ago, according to Autodata figures.In contrast, the balance of U.S. vehicle sales at each of Japan’s top three automakers is roughly even, suggesting that while they are producing more vehicles, the model mix of their sales is lagging market trends.Honda is responding by expanding production capacity for its CR-V SUV model in the United States. Another option is importing the CR-V, along with the popular Civic, from Japan, a company spokeswoman said.“While maintaining our current overall capacity (in North America), we’d like to also consider our production options in Japan ... to produce more light trucks to respond to strong demand,�� American Honda Motor Co CEO Toshiaki Mikoshiba said.The Japanese are not alone in trying to adapt to the demand shifts. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS has been producing its Santa Fe Sport model at its Alabama plant since June to increase supply of the SUV while sales of its mainstay sedans such as the Sonata stagnate.Both Honda and Toyota recently cited a less competitive product mix as a reason for trimming their respective annual North American vehicle sales forecasts.Toyota will increase production capacity of its Tacoma pick-up truck at its plant in Mexico by more than 60,000 to an annual 160,000 by 2018 while it is also looking to its upcoming C-HR crossover model to lift sales in the segment.In the meantime, total Japanese exports of Toyota’s popular RAV4 model to the United States rose 20 percent in January-September from a year ago, even as the model’s production at its plant in Canada has increased by 3 percent over the same period.Nissan has ramped up exports of its Rogue crossover from Japan to North America by 27 percent to 56,000 units in the April-September period from a year ago, while it also exports a large number of Rogues from South Korea.Japan’s No. 2 automaker in August moved production of its Armada SUV from its plant in Mississippi to Japan to make room to make more Titan pick-up trucks and Murano SUVs. In April-September it sent 8,000 Armadas to North America.Toyota, Nissan and Honda all anticipate that the rampant growth in the U.S. market may slow going forward, and Lindland at Kelley Blue Book said that flexible production capabilities, rather than more capacity, was key to keeping pace with demand.“I wouldn’t recommend adding new plants because the market is plateauing,�� she said. “There’s a fine line between having enough inventory and over building.��	8.852166146

SEOUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hyundai Motor posted a surprise 5.5 percent fall in quarterly net profit, missing forecasts, as record car sales were dented by the impact of a stronger local currency and the cost of compensating drivers in North America for overstated fuel-economy claims.The South Korean automaker, ranked fifth in global sales with affiliate Kia Motors, reported October-December net profit of 1.89 trillion won ($1.8 billion), down from 2 trillion won a year earlier. That compares with a consensus forecast of 2.15 trillion won in a Reuters poll of 15 analysts.Hyundai, which has enjoyed strong sales growth in recent years by offering stylish, yet affordable models such as the Sonata and Elantra, sold 1.23 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, up 11 percent from a year earlier.Shares in Hyundai Motor touched a four-week high on Wednesday, but are among the worst performers in the global autos industry with a 10 percent drop in the last four months. Over the same period, shares in Japanese rival Toyota Motor have gained 30 percent - a reflection of the recent shifts in the two economies�� currencies.	3.843743472
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and BMW AG BMWG.DE will jointly research a lithium-air battery expected to be more powerful than the lithium-ion batteries used in many hybrid and electric vehicles, the two firms said.The two companies will also work on a fuel cell vehicle system, which includes a hydrogen tank and motor, by 2020, they said on Thursday.The strengthening of the partnership between Toyota, the world’s best-selling automaker, and BMW, the largest premium carmaker, will allow them to cut development costs as competition intensifies globally.“In order for FCVs (fuel cell vehicles) to become more widely used, it needs to be cheaper. That would require a great deal of time and cost for development,�� said Toyota Vice Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, who led development of the bestselling Prius hybrid in the late 1990s.“By bringing together the wisdom of two companies, we can aim to make FCVs more popular much quicker,�� he told a news conference with BMW at Nagoya, central Japan.Toyota said it wanted to introduce a new fuel cell vehicle around 2020 using the jointly developed technology, while BMW said a launch date had not been decided. Toyota aims to start selling a fuel cell sedan by around 2015.The two companies reiterated that they had no plans for a capital tie-up.Toyota uses lithium-ion batteries in its Prius plug-in hybrid, some Prius v, and the eQ electric car.A lithium-air battery has its anode filled with lithium, and cathode with air. Theoretically, the battery can generate and store more electricity than the existing lithium-ion battery.The technology is being studied by researchers including IBM IMB.N, which is working to develop a lithium-air battery that will let electric vehicles run 500 miles on one charge.Toyota and BMW also said they would work on a shared platform and technology for a mid-sized sports car, and develop technologies to make cars lighter and thus more fuel-efficient.Eager to strengthen its diesel engine line-up in a sagging European market, Toyota agreed in 2011 to collaborate with BMW on lithium-ion battery research in exchange for a steady supply of BMW-made diesel engines starting in 2014.BMW, which needs to cut carbon emissions of its new car fleet by roughly a third by 2020, agreed with Toyota in 2012 to work on fuel cells and electrified powertrains too.Toyota’s Uchiyamada said they wanted to decide as soon as possible on how to collaborate on the electrified powertrains.	3.454734651

DETROIT, Jan 26 (Reuters) - January U.S. auto sales will rise 12.4 percent from a relatively low base a year ago, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Monday.A year ago, January sales were pressured by severe cold and snowy weather over much of the United States. The forecast does not take into account the possible impact of a blizzard that could dump two or three feet of snow over the Northeast on Monday and Tuesday.LMC Automotive forecaster Jeff Schuster said the storm “likely will have some temporary impact on auto sales for January.”Another forecast issued on Monday, by industry research firm TrueCar, said sales will show a 13.2 percent gain in January. General Motors Co will have the largest year-over-year increase to sales, TrueCar said.It said the following automakers will outpace the industry in January new vehicle sales: GM up 18.4 percent; Honda Motor Co up 16.8 percent; Nissan Motor Co up 14.8 percent; Ford Motor Co up 14.7 percent; Toyota Motor Corp up 13.9 percent; and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles 13.4 percent.TrueCar said industry incentive spending, or retail price discounts, will show a drop of 10.4 percent in January.	4.347826087
YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co cut its full-year net profit forecast by 20 percent to 320 billion yen ($3.99 billion), joining rival Honda Motor, after car sales tumbled in China, the world’s biggest autos market, amid anti-Japanese protests over a territorial dispute.The average forecast of 25 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S was for annual net profit of 378 billion yen. Thomson Reuters StarMine’s SmartEstimate, which places greater emphasis on timely forecasts by top-rated analysts, forecast 360 billion yen.July-September net profit rose 7.7 percent to 106 billion yen, Nissan said on Tuesday, despite lower than expected car sales in the United States and Europe. That beat an average estimate for 91.4 billion yen by seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Demand for Nissan, Toyota Motor and Honda cars virtually halved in China in the past two months, with Nissan and its China joint venture selling 64,300 vehicles in the local market in October, down 41 percent from a year ago.Nissan is the most exposed to China among Japan’s leading carmakers. China is Nissan’s biggest market by car sales volume, accounting for around 27 percent of its vehicle sales.In the United States, Nissan’s second-biggest market, the firm faced a production delay around July when it began selling its latest Altima mid-sized sedan in North America.Shares in Nissan, 43.4 percent-held by France’s Renault SA and valued at close to $39 billion, have slipped 2 percent so far this year, trailing Toyota’s 26 percent gain and Honda’s around 3 percent rise.	8.057228916
* Auto sales rate at 14.94 mln, highest since March 2008* GM, Ford see soft truck sales; Toyota up 41.5 pct* Cheap financing, consumer confidence fueling salesDETROIT, Oct 2 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales last month posted their best showing in 4-1/2 years, helped by cheap financing, rising consumer confidence and a major rebound by Toyota Motor Corp.The September sales pace was 14.94 million vehicles as calculated on an annualized basis, exceeding analyst estimates of 14.5 million, according to Autodata Corp. This was the highest rate since March 2008, about four months after the start of the 2007-2009 U.S. recession.U.S. auto sales last month rose 13 percent to 1,188,865 new vehicles. Analysts, on average, had expected an increase of less than 9 percent.General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co said rising home prices and a drop in jobless claims encouraged American car shoppers to buy new vehicles.The wider availability of cheap financing also spurred sales. About one-third of Toyota buyers who financed their purchase last month received a no-interest loan, according to industry research firm Edmunds.com. Toyota’s proportion of no-interest deals was higher than any other automaker.“The money is so cheap now,�� said Jesse Toprak, TrueCar.com analyst. “Higher resale values and cheap money has been enabling automakers to offer some of the most attractive leasing programs we’ve seen in years.”About 80 percent of new vehicle transactions are financed, said R.L. Polk analyst Tom Libby.The interest rate on a 48-month new car loan was about 3.19 percent last month, down from 4.39 percent in September 2011, according to Bankrate.com.That rate was about 7.45 percent in May 2009, during the depths of the downturn that pushed GM and Chrysler Group LLC to file for government-funded bankruptcies three years ago.During the recent recession, which officially lasted until June 2009, U.S. consumers delayed big-ticket purchases, pushing the average age of vehicles on the road to a record high.That pent-up demand has fueled auto sales growth this year as cars and trucks on the road push past the point of repair and consumers�� economic prospects improve.“I think in general with the economy chugging along at about 1.5 percent to 2 percent that we are gradually seeing people come back,�� said Ford chief economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick.GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said sales of its mini, small and compact cars nearly doubled last month. Ford’s small car sales rose about 73 percent, while fuel prices rose.But both automakers said pickup truck sales in September, when those sales typically strengthen, were softer than in years past. Both GM and Ford said trucks made up about 12 percent of sales last month, down from 13 percent in September 2011.“There has been a fundamental shift of truck to car that we’ve been seeing for the past few years,�� said Chevrolet’s sales chief, Don Johnson, adding that September’s results represented a continuation of that trend.“Consumers, because of the price of fuel, have definitely shifted over the last couple of years to a stronger mix on the car side,�� he said.Ford shares ended 1.4 percent lower at $9.79 and GM shares gained 2.6 percent to close at $23.68 on Tuesday.GM sold 210,245 cars and trucks last month, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier. Ford sold 174,976 cars and trucks last month, on par with its results from a year ago.Chrysler, the U.S. automaker majority-owned by Italy’s Fiat SpA, showed a 12 percent jump in sales to 142,041.Toyota said vehicle sales rose 41.5 percent to 171,190 last month, while Honda Motor Co sales rose about 31 percent to 117,211.The outsized gains from Toyota and Honda reflect their recovery from inventory shortages last year after the March 2011 earthquake in Japan.Volkswagen of America, the U.S. arm of Volkswagen AG , sales rose 34.4 percent.Nissan Motor Co’s sales fell 1.1 percent to 91,907 vehicles, hurt by higher fuel prices as well as inventory shortages of its Altima midsize sedan, said Al Castignetti, U.S. sales chief for the Nissan brand.	0.9210014269
TOKYO (Reuters) - Against the backdrop of the coronavirus epidemic and a looming global economic slowdown, major Japanese firms tightened their belts in influential annual wage deals hammered out with unions on Wednesday.Setting the tone, bellwether Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it had agreed to give workers an average monthly pay raise that's 20% lower than last year's hike. What's more, base pay will not rise for the first time in seven years.Major steelmakers followed suit and did not raise base pay, threatening Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s lofty goal of generating a self-sustaining growth cycle - a key plank of his ‘Abenomics�� policies to stimulate the world’s third-biggest economy.Over the past six years, major firms raised wages more than 2% each spring as Abe pressured businesses to boost pay to put an end to deflation and stagnation that has dogged Japan for two decades.BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said he would closely watch the outcome of the wage talks for clues on the inflation trend, amid speculation the central bank may expand stimulus next week to mitigate the economic damage from the coronavirus.“Substantial wage increases cannot be expected in 2020 as base pay won’t rise much,�� said Yoshiyuki Suimon, senior economist at Nomura Securities. He was referring to base pay hikes, which determine regular pay that accounts for most of monthly salary.Rather then lifting base pay, Toyota agreed to an average rise of 8,600 yen ($82.31) per month for all employees.The increase in the fiscal year starting in April compared with last year’s 10,700 yen raise.“Any negative impact to our current situation could have a significant impact on our workforce,�� Masanori Kuwata, Toyota’s deputy chief human resources officer, told reporters after reaching the agreement with its union.“Because of this, we opted to forgo raising base salaries this year,�� Kuwata said, adding that Toyota’s base salaries are already among the highest in the country.Japanese major steelmakers - Nippon Steel 5401.T, JFE Steel, a unit of JFE Holdings 5411.T and Kobe Steel Ltd 5406.T - said they agreed with unions that there would be no base wage increases for two years, the Nikkei business daily said. It would be the first time in seven years that these firms have not hiked base wages.“Companies are turning cautious about base pay hikes as the new virus outbreak will exacerbate declines in profits,�� said Koya Miyamae, a senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.“As the virus outbreak deepens, labour unions are also losing momentum towards base pay hikes, and both manufacturers and non-manufacturers become half-hearted about wage hikes.”With the economy teetering on the brink of a recession, Japanese firms have begun to take a more varied approach on remuneration, with more eschewing blanket pay hikes and shifting to merit-based wages rather than seniority-oriented pay in an effort to attract young and skilled workers.Wage strategies have also been affected by structural changes in Japan’s labour market.About 40% of workers are now lower-paid part-time staff and contract workers - double the proportion seen in 1990, just before the Japan’s asset bubble burst.The growing army of lower-paid workers has led unions to prioritise addressing the income gap between permanent employees and others, rather than broad uniform pay raises.	-1.246029807
WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Major automakers said on Wednesday they have agreed to equip nearly all U.S. vehicles with systems to remind motorists of passengers in the back seat, by model year 2025, in an effort to avoid deaths of young children left behind in hot cars.The announcement on so-called rear seat reminder systems comes as the U.S. Congress has been debating the issue. In July, the Senate Commerce Committee passed by voice vote legislation to eventually require automakers to install technology on new vehicles alerting exiting parents to check for children in the back seat.The automakers from two trade groups representing nearly all automakers said the companies are committing to include audible and visual alerts on vehicles by the 2025 model year but could get an additional 12 months for vehicles about to be redesigned and could exempt emergency motor vehicles.The 20 automakers taking part represent nearly 98% of all U.S. vehicle sales.The automakers include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda Motor Co.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said it will eventually adopt the reminder technology on all vehicles worldwide but said timing by region will vary.GM has had a system on some U.S. vehicles since 2016 that provides audible alert and a visual reminder on the vehicle dashboard to check for a child before exiting.Lawmakers say more than 800 children in parked vehicles have died from heatstroke in the United States over the last two decades.The systems generally operate to alert a driver to the presence of a child if a rear door was opened at the start of a trip. Some safety advocates want a more advanced system that would detect the actual presence of a child in the back seat.U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said in an interview the voluntary agreement makes the legislation unnecessary. Under the legislation being considered, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would be compelled to write regulations and then automakers would have at least two years�� lead time.“This gives us essentially everything we’ve asked for and it does it sooner,�� said Wicker, who added the Transportation Department plans to use some discretionary funds for a public information campaign. “It is a huge win.”NHTSA typically takes years to write regulations. For example, a proposal to require automakers to send email notifications of recalls has been pending for more than three years.Wicker’s bill would also direct states to use a portion of highway safety program funds to educate the public on the risks of leaving a child or unattended passenger in a vehicle, and require the Transportation Department to conduct a third-party study on retrofitting existing passenger motor vehicles.U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat who cosponsored the legislation, noted earlier this year that many newer vehicles alert drivers if they leave their keys behind. “You should get a warning if you leave a child in the car,�� she added.

* Toyota lags rival Volkswagen in parts-sharing strategy* Toyota declines to give name of the vehicle* Toyota opens up to standardized parts used by other companies (Recasts, adds quote by executive vice president, information on Toyota and VW’s platform strategies)TOYOTA, Japan, March 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will start selling vehicles in 2015 under its new plan to ramp up the use of shared parts as it catches up with rival Volkswagen, which pioneered the strategy.Initially, vehicles using the same platform and developed under Toyota’s new strategy will share 20-30 percent of the parts in the platform, a ratio Toyota wants to expand to 70-80 percent.“Global competition among automakers is becoming more severe, and TNGA (Toyota New Global Architecture) is an effort to make more efficient and more attractive products,�� executive vice president Mitsuhisa Kato told reporters.Germany’s Volkswagen was the first to implement a modular development and production concept, whereby a basic design can be built in subtle variations and sold in different markets, helping the company to cut costs.If the idea pays off, Volkswagen could snatch Toyota’s crown as the world’s top selling automaker as early as next year, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.“We may be behind in terms of the timing. But in the end, what matters is the ability to make good products,�� said Toyota’s Kato.Toyota, which under President Akio Toyoda has been shifting gear to longer-term growth rather than short-term gains, plans to use the money and manpower it has saved to improve vehicle design and quality.Kato declined to give the name of the first vehicle that Toyota will launch in 2015.Toyota has said that under TNGA, it will initially focus on developing three new platforms; one that is used in the Camry mid-sized sedan, another used in the Prius hybrid and the Corolla small sedan, and one used in the Yaris subcompact car.These new platforms will have a lower center of gravity for better turning and stopping and a more attractive design, the company said. Toyota is also open to adopting standard parts that are widely used by other automakers, it said. (Reporting by Yoko Kubota; editing by Miral Fahmy and Louise Heavens)	13.54247857
PRAGUE, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Czech car sales are likely to rise more than 10 percent to a record 260,000 vehicles in 2016, an official from the Car Importers�� Association (SDA) estimated on Friday.The Czech economy has been among the fastest growing in Europe and domestic demand has become an important part of the expansion, alongside foreign trade, in the country of 10.6 million.The industry body’s latest sales estimate is up from an earlier forecast of 250,000 cars. CTK news agency cited an SDA official as saying on Friday sales would now reach between 255,000 and 260,000.The car sector is the driving force for the economy thanks to three car plants - run by Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto; Hyundai Motor ; and TPCA, a joint venture of Toyota Motor Corp and PSA Peugeot Citroen - that together produce more than a million cars a year.The large majority of output is for export.The Czech economy is set to grow by more than 2 percent in 2016 before accelerating to around 3 percent in 2017.In 2015, it expanded by 4.6 percent after the country saw a record influx of European Union development funds before the last financing period expired. Car sales last year grew around 20 percent. (Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Adrian Croft)	-1.409052092
DETROIT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Automakers recalled nearly 22 million cars and trucks in 2013, the most in nearly a decade, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report released on Monday.The manufacturer with the largest number of safety actions was Toyota Motor Corp, followed by Chrysler Group LLC , Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co and Ford Motor Co.Toyota recalled 5.3 million vehicles in 15 safety actions last year, including more 844,000 older-model Corolla cars, Sequoia SUVs and Tundra pick-up trucks for faulty airbags.About 15 million vehicles were recalled by automakers after they spotted a problem, while about 7 million cars and trucks were recalled following an NHTSA investigation.The number of vehicles involved in a safety recall last year rose by more than one-third from 2012, when 16.4 million models were recalled for safety defects and other reasons. Overall, safety recalls totaled 632 in 2013, up from 581 in 2012.Last year marked the largest number of vehicles recalled for safety defects since 2004, when 30.8 million models were affected, according to the report.	1.920170682
NAGOYA (Reuters) - As sharing services change car use and ownership, Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T new design chief believes that vehicles will shift towards either generic boxes on wheels for everyday use or ultra-luxury cars, wiping out the need for mass-market models.Simon Humphries, responsible for design at the automaker’s Toyota and Lexus brands, said that fleets of electric, self-driving shuttle bus-like vehicles could one day eliminate the need for people to drive themselves around on a daily basis.This could one day make cars like its popular Camry and Corolla models obsolete down the line.“On one side we’re going to see this optimized (transport) system, but on the other side you’re going to see a pure race car,�� Humphries, who last month became general manager of Toyota’s advanced R&amp;D and engineering company, told reporters in Nagoya.“There will be an emotional solution, and a practical solution. So maybe the story is that the middle ground is increasingly going to disappear.”Toyota, one of the world’s largest automakers which for years has focused on building reliable, fun to drive cars, is now also looking beyond personal-use vehicles to survive in an industry which is being transformed by the onslaught of electrification, automation and other new technologies.As automakers compete to come up with new, profitable transport services, Toyota last month showed a self-driving electric concept vehicle which can be used as buses, mobile shops or moving offices.Toyota plans to test these next-generation vehicles in the early 2020s.The ability for cars to drive themselves in the future, along with the development of electric cars, will be a game-changer for vehicle design, Humphries said, as it will eliminate the need for steering wheels, engines, petrol tanks and other traditional parts, enabling more flexibility to design vehicles which are more fit-for-purpose.“At the moment everything in a car from a design point of view is based on a 100-year old package -- engine in the front, and a driver holding a steering wheel behind,�� he said.“When you don’t have to hold a steering wheel, the world is your oyster.��	-6.138032305

MADRID, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Spain’s antitrust regulator CNC said on Wednesday it is investigating possible price fixing in the country by some of the world’s largest car firms.CNC will examine evidence that affiliates of, among others, Volkswagen, Renault, Peugeot, Toyota, General Motors, Nissan and Ford shared market-sensitive information to set prices and service contracts.“These are considered very serious (alleged) infringements that could lead to fines of up to 10 percent of total (Spanish) annual turnover,�� CNC said in a statement.The investigation, which targets both the companies and their Spanish distributors, was a priority “given the serious consequences for consumers,�� it added.Nissan, Ford, Toyota and Seat, which is VW’s Spanish subsidiary, said they were aware of the investigation and were cooperating.“The opening of the proceedings does not mean that any competition law infringement has taken place,�� Nissan said in a statement. Renault also said the company had not broken any competition laws, while Ford added it operated within the law.“GM Espana has never engaged in any cartel and will cooperate with the authorities to support their investigation,�� a GM spokesman said.Spanish carmakers have struggled for business against the backdrop of a five-year economic slump that, along with an unemployment rate above 25 percent, has depressed demand for consumer goods.They have been able to draw on a government scheme to subsidise purchases of new cars, extended by 70 million euros ($92 million) in July after an initial programme expired.Under the scheme, people who scrap their old car and buy a new one get a rebate of 2,000 euros, half from the government and half from the carmaker.But sales of new cars in the country dropped 18.3 percent year-on-year in August, manufacturers�� association Anfac said on Monday.The CNC said the probe will be based on data gathered in June and July during inspections of showrooms and the headquarters of the main car brands present in Spain.Spain’s car manufacturing sector has been helped by labour market reforms which has made it easier for firms to hire and fire workers.	-0.2387774594
(Reuters) - Auto safety regulators have opened an investigation to determine which automakers may have produced vehicles with gas-filled struts on rear liftgates that are prone to failure.The gas struts, made by Koblenz, Germany-based auto supplier Stabilus, were involved in four previous recalls of about 276,000 minivans sold in the United States. Now, safety regulators want Stabilus to give them a list of customers who may have used the same type of gas-filled struts.Representatives for Stabilus could not immediately be reached to comment.The gas-filled struts help raise, lower and support liftgates on vehicles with power liftgates. They could close unexpectedly due to a leak of pressurized gas, increasing the risk of injury, according to a filing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Also, the liftgates may drop unexpectedly after reaching the fully open position.Stabilus is a global auto parts supplier, and has U.S.-based facilities.The four past recalls all involved minivans: the Honda Motor Co Odyssey for model years 2005, 2008 and 2009; the 2004 to 2006 Toyota Motor Corp Sienna; the 2004-2006 Ford Freestar; and the 2004-2006 Mercury Monterey.The largest recall was for 196,222 Toyota Sienna, recalled in 20008. The Honda recall was in February of this year.The Freestar and the Monterey recalls were made in 2006. The Freestar and Monterey minivans are no longer in production, and the Mercury brand was killed by Ford Motor Co two years ago.An investigation is not a recall, but depending on the results of the probe, may lead to one or more of them.	4.697554698
PRETORIA (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Ford is hesitant about investing further in its South African operation because of repeated production stoppages caused by strikes, its regional chief said on Thursday.The South African auto industry, which accounts for about 6 percent of the continent’s most developed economy, has been hit directly and indirectly by four strikes in the past year.“A challenge for us here in South Africa is convincing our board to continue to invest in a country where the stability of output is a little less certain than in other countries,�� Jeff Nemeth, president of Ford’s South African business, told reporters.Carmakers resumed production in September after a four-week strike by 220,000 metalworkers. Last year a strike by auto workers cost the industry $2 billion in lost output, followed by a strike in the auto parts sector and another by truck drivers who haul vehicles to ports and dealerships.“Year after year after year, having that much of your output constrained by labor actions, you don’t have a clear view of what your output might be,�� Nemeth said. “That will have an impact in our investment decisions.”Ford sells about 6,000 vehicles a month in South Africa, making it the third-largest supplier behind Toyota and Volkswagen. It also exports vehicles.	1.443832415
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T eked out its smallest quarterly profit in nine years as the coronavirus pandemic halved its car sales and nearly wiped out its bottom line.However, shares in Japan's top automaker rose 2.3% in a weaker broader market .N225 as analysts had expected a loss, while comments from a company spokesman on a faster-than-expected sales recovery also provided support.Toyota’s operating profit plunged 98% to 13.9 billion yen ($131.73 million) for the three months ended June, better than a consensus estimate for a loss of 179 billion yen drawn from a Refinitiv poll of seven analysts.The sharply lower earnings underlines the challenges the auto industry is facing because of the pandemic that has shuttered factories and kept customers out of dealerships.But Toyota is weathering the virus outbreak better than many of its rivals. Most global automakers fell into the red in the latest quarter, and many, including Ford Motor Co F.N, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T, are bracing for full-year operating losses. Toyota reiterated its annual operating profit forecast of 500 billion yen, its weakest in nine years, arguing that the coronavirus could still hurt its brighter sales outlook.“The pace of recovery in a number of regions has been faster than we had initially forecast,�� a Toyota spokesman said.“But the virus situation continues to place many uncertainties on the business outlook ... and we see a possibility that our forecast could change.��(For interactive charts on Toyota's vehicle sales and profit, click)The maker of the RAV4 SUV crossover and the Prius gasoline hybrid expects global retail sales of 9.1 million cars this year, its lowest in nine years.That would mark a 13% decline from 10.46 million last year, but is an improvement on a previous outlook for a 15% drop.Toyota expects to take the most serious hit in North America, its biggest market, accounting for about a quarter of its global sales, and where it sees an annual sales drop of 14%.A 62% tumble in the region during the first quarter led to a 50% slump in consolidated global sales to 1.16 million units.But as sales have plummeted in most regions, China has been a bright spot for Toyota. Demand in the world’s biggest car market recovered faster than elsewhere as the tightly controlled state has largely beaten back the pandemic and reopened its economy.Toyota’s Lexus luxury brand has been a big beneficiary of the return in demand, pushing January-July sales up 7% on the year thanks to online marketing campaigns during the country’s lockdown. Toyota expects global sales to gradually improve through December, returning to normal in January-March 2021 to be up 5% on the year.Starting in April, Toyota began using the International Financial Reporting Standards to calculate its consolidated financials results.	2.251831074
* Issues in steering intermediate extension shaft, water pump* Second multi-million car recall in two months* Steering issue can be fixed in 50 mins, water pump 1.5 hours-spokesmanTOKYO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it will recall around 2.77 million vehicles worldwide, including certain models of the Prius, due to problems with the steering mechanism and the hybrid system water pump, its second multi-million car recall in two months.Toyota is recalling 1.5 million vehicles in Japan, 670,000 vehicles in the United States and 496,000 vehicles in Europe over a problem in the steering intermediate extension shafts, which could be damaged at slow speed, spokesman Joichi Tachikawa said on Wednesday.This problem, seen in cars such as the second-generation Prius and certain Corolla models can be fixed in about 50 minutes, he said.Separately, the Japanese carmaker is also recalling 630,000 vehicles worldwide, including 350,000 in the United States and 175,000 in Japan, to fix water pumps in hybrid vehicles, Tachikawa said.Some vehicles are target of both recalls, making the total number of vehicles to be recalled at 2.77 million, he said.Shares in Toyota were down 0.5 percent to 3,070 yen as of 2:44 p.m. (0544 GMT), slightly underperforming the main Nikkei that rose 0.1 percent.In October, Toyota said it was pulling back more than 7.4 million vehicles worldwide to fix faulty power window switches, the industry’s biggest single recall since Ford Motor Co took 8 million vehicles off the road in 1996.A series of Toyota recalls involving more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011 damaged the firm’s image, but it recovered and earlier this month raised its full-year net profit forecast to $9.7 billion, citing solid sales.Toyota has sold about 3.3 million Prius hybrid vehicles globally since the car went on sale in December 1997. The total number of hybrid vehicles it sold worldwide, including other models such as the Camry, was 4.6 million as of end-October.This year’s profit forecast comes despite a big drop in car sales in China since September, when anti-Japanese protests erupted over a diplomatic row.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is aiming to start producing electric vehicles (EVs) in 2022, a senior official at the Industry Ministry told Reuters on Thursday, after a number of companies disclosed plans to invest in the country.Indonesia is pushing for the development of EV and battery production facilities to create a downstream industry for the country’s rich supplies of nickel laterite ore, which is used in lithium batteries.Companies such as Toyota Motor Corp and Hyundai have expressed interest in building EV plants in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s second-largest car production hub.Toyota has committed to invest $2 billion in Indonesia over the next five years, part of which will be used to produce EVs, Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto, told reporters on Thursday.“By 2022, production of electric-based vehicles should start,�� said Harjanto, director general of metal, machinery, transportation and electronics at the Industry Ministry, adding that the government has targeted EVs to reach a 20% share of national car production by 2025.Speaking on the sidelines of Indonesia’s largest car show, Harjanto said the government is finalising the revision of a luxury car tax scheme to encourage the production of cars with lower carbon emissions.The government is also offering tax holidays for companies producing EV batteries in Indonesia.“Recently there were a few battery companies which met the (industry) minister, but it is still an initial intention,�� Harjanto said, declining to name the companies.“They see Indonesia has big potential to develop electric-based products due to the availability of raw material,�� he said.Several companies are currently developing smelters with high pressure acid leach (HPAL) technology to produce battery chemicals in Indonesia, including China’s Tsingshan Group.	-0.4071598679
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers are siding with the Trump administration in its bid to bar California from setting its own fuel efficiency rules or zero-emission requirements for vehicles, the companies said in a filing with a U.S. appeals court late on Monday.The move by firms including General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, follows legal challenges by California and 22 states and environmental groups in September.Those challenges aim to undo the Trump administration’s determination, issued in September, that federal law bars California from setting stiff tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.In their filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the automakers and the National Automobile Dealers Association said they backed the administration bid to bar individual emissions rules by states.They asked to intervene, arguing the administration’s rule provided “vehicle manufacturers with the certainty that states cannot interfere with federal fuel economy standards.”The decision to side with President Donald Trump could prompt a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.It also poses a risk for automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in next year’s election and reverses Trump’s actions, and also reinstates California’s right to set its own rules and tougher national emissions standards adopted by President Barack Obama.A spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the action “doesn’t change our resolve to fight as long and hard as necessary to protect our standards.”She added, “The courts have upheld our authority to set standards before and we’re hopeful they will yet again.”Other automakers, such as Ford Motor Co F.N, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not joining the bid to intervene on the administration's side.The group backing Trump also includes Mazda 7261.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS and Subaru Co 9778.T.John Bozzella, president and chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing major foreign firms, said the companies had little choice but to back the administration.“It’s been the federal policy for the better part of 40 years that the federal government has the sole responsibility for regulating fuel economy standards, but it doesn’t have to get to that,�� Bozzella told reporters, speaking for an ad-hoc group, the Coalition for Sustainable Automotive Regulation.“We can still reach an agreement�� on fuel economy rules, Bozzella said, adding that companies still support a “middle ground�� between California and the administration that would see rising attainable fuel efficiency requirements. He said the Trump administration did not ask the automakers to intervene.Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, had harsh words for the automakers.“Instead of choosing the responsible path forged by four automakers and the state of California, one that will move us toward the cleaner, alternative fuel vehicles of the future, these companies have chosen to head down a dead-end road,�� Carper said in a statement.A group of major environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists and Natural Resources Defense Council, sued in September to block the determination.On Friday, seven U.S. states, including Alabama, Ohio, Texas, Utah and West Virginia, also filed in support of the Trump regulation, arguing that without the rule their residents would have to pay “higher vehicle costs.”In Aug. 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, with average annual increases of nearly 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option.The final rule is expected to modestly boost fuel efficiency from the initial proposal, with some automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, but still much less stringent than the Obama rules.The group was not taking a position on what those requirements should be, Bozzella emphasized, but reiterated they should continue to rise annually.“The decision to intervene in the lawsuit is about how the standard should be applied, not what the standard should be,�� Bozzella said.The announcement showed an industry split.After the four automakers, including BMW AG, announced the voluntary California pact, the Justice Department warned them the agreement “may violate federal antitrust laws,�� according to documents seen by Reuters.	1.103259302
(Autodata corrected the annualized selling rate to 16.5 million from 16.45 million in 5th paragraph)DETROIT, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. auto industry sales in April came in below expectations as Asia’s major carmakers�� results disappointed, offsetting strong gains for trucks and SUVs made by General Motors and Ford.Sales reported on Friday by Japan’s Nissan, Toyota and Honda, as well as the combined results for South Korea’s Hyundai and its Kia affiliate, all missed expectations. Fiat Chrysler also disappointed.Industry sales in April finished at 1,454,951 vehicles, up 4.6 percent according to research firm Autodata. That was below the gain of 6 percent analysts had expected as consumer appetite for trucks and SUVs favored the “Big Three�� Detroit automakers.“When demand for crossovers, SUVs and trucks is strong, the Asian automakers don’t do so well,�� said Jesse Toprak, an independent consultant.The industry’s annual sales rate for the month was 16.50 million vehicles, below the 16.7 million to 16.8 million many analysts had expected.Nevertheless, industry executives said demand remains strong and the industry was headed toward its best year in almost a decade.“Consumer and commercial customer demand for pickups and utility vehicles has been building since last fall,�� said Kurt McNeil, GM’s U.S. vice president of sales operations. “The auto industry continues to be on track to have its best sales year since 2006.”U.S. industry sales slipped to 16.5 million vehicles in 2006 from almost 17 million the prior year, and fell as low as 10.4 million in 2009 during the recession, before beginning to climb.Ford officials said average vehicle prices in the industry were up $1,000 from last year to $31,200 per vehicle, and dismissed concerns about longer loan rates, with some now at 84 months.Ford’s U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said the increase in duration has been driven by buyers with good credit scores stretching to buy more premium vehicles, rather than by consumers with high-risk credit.The other side of hot truck demand is weaker car sales, which has led to production cuts and layoffs by some automakers. Ford previously said it would lay off 700 people and reduce production at the Michigan plant building the Focus, which saw sales in April fall 5 percent. LaNeve vowed Ford would not create “unnatural demand�� for cars through higher incentives.GM’s April sales rose 6 percent to 269,056 vehicles as truck and crossover sales jumped 13 percent and 25 percent, respectively.Ford’s sales increased 5.4 percent to 222,498 vehicles as sales of Ford-brand SUVs jumped 12 percent. Retail sales of the new F-Series pickup truck increased 8 percent, and its average sales prices hit an all-time high of $42,600 per vehicle.Fiat Chrysler’s sales rose 5.8 percent to 189,027 vehicles as Jeep brand sales jumped 20 percent.Nissan sales increased 5.7 percent to 109,848 vehicles as demand for Nissan crossovers, trucks and SUVs rose 23.7 percent. Toyota was up 1.8 percent, while Honda sales fell by the same amount. Hyundai sales rose 2.9 percent, while Kia’s slipped almost 1 percent. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, G Crosse)	-2.013422819
(Reuters) - Automakers, not technology companies, are in the driver’s seat in developing self-driving, “autonomous�� cars, and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp is best positioned to lead the way, according to a new report on patents for the fast-evolving technology.As automakers enter agreements with Silicon Valley companies to develop self-driving cars, Tesla Motor Inc and Apple Inc would make logical partners, the report says.The report, by the Intellectual Property and Science division of Thomson Reuters, is based on a detailed analysis of patent filings by automakers and tech companies for autonomous-car technology. The findings illuminate the challenges for both established automakers and Silicon Valley companies as they compete to profit from moving people around in a world that is increasingly congested and concerned about carbon emissions.The global auto industry is in the midst of three simultaneous, and interconnected, technology revolutions. The first is the quest for cleaner alternatives to internal-combustion engines. The second involves connectivity and linking cars to information or data services. Lastly, the autonomy revolution is the effort to develop self-driving cars that could enable services in which electric cars connected to the Web can be summoned to provide rides on demand.“Automakers aren’t as good as technology companies in tooting their own horns,�� Tony Trippe, principal author of the report, told Reuters in an interview. “But when you look at the patent data, the automakers are all over this.”Toyota is, far and away, the global leader in the number of self-driving car patents, the report found. Toyota is followed by Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH, Japan’s Denso Corp , Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and General Motors Co. The tech company with the most autonomous-driving patents, Alphabet Inc’s Google, ranks 26th on the list.The report from the Thomson Reuters unit comes as auto and technology industry executives are gathering at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where alliances to advance autonomous driving and connected vehicles will be central topics.GM said on Monday it will invest $500 million in Lyft Inc as it forges a Detroit-Silicon Valley partnership with the ride-sharing service to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars.Toyota, the Thomson Reuters report found, has more than 1,400 patents on autonomous-driving devices, more than twice as many as any other company. One recent Toyota patent application, for example, is for software that avoids a car’s self-driving system being switched off, and thus defaulting to “manual mode�� in which the driver controls the car, unless the driver intends to turn off the system.The raw number of patents does not necessarily equate to leadership in developing self-driving cars, Trippe said. Non-U.S. companies tend to be more aggressive in filing patent applications than American companies. The quality of patents is also important, since not all are created equal.Another potential limitation of the report is the 18-month lag time between patent filings and when the filings are published for the public.In reality, driverless-car development will require alliances between automakers and technology companies, even though both sides will try to gain the upper hand in partnerships.A Toyota spokesman said the automaker views a fully self-driving car as a long term goal, but one that must wait for autonomous driving systems that never make a mistake. In the meantime, Toyota is accelerating efforts to equip cars with automatic braking and other safety systems that can help avoid crashes.Most experts say fully self-driving vehicles are unlikely to be roaming roads in large numbers for many years yet. Google has been testing self-driving cars since 2009, though, and automakers such as Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit have revealed cars that can travel long distances without human intervention.Trippe said Apple and Tesla would make logical partners in autonomous cars because they have complementary, not duplicative patents. Tesla’s strength is propulsion technology, notably batteries, while Apple’s is in electronic navigation and communication systems.As the race to develop self-driving cars heats up, automakers are also introducing more “semi-autonomous�� driving systems that handle tedious or tricky situations. Audi, for instance, is expected to use the CES show to outline progress on a system that allows cars to pilot themselves in traffic jams at low speeds.	-6.749450921
"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico must be ready to respond immediately with its own tax measures if the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump imposes a border tax, the economy minister said on Friday, warning such protectionism may trigger a global recession.Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has promised a “major border tax�� on companies that shift jobs outside the United States, and such a measure could hobble Mexico’s exports to its top trading partner.“It is clear we need to be prepared to immediately neutralize the impact of such a measure,�� Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an interview on Mexican television.“And it is very clear how - take a fiscal action that clearly neutralizes it,�� he said.Trump has repeatedly attacked Mexico over trade, jobs and immigration since he first launched his run for the White House in 2015, driving the peso currency to historic lows and unnerving investors, especially in the auto sector.Guajardo said Trump’s proposed tax “was a problem for the entire world�� and that it “would have a wave of impacts that could take us into a global recession.”Nonetheless, the minister said he expected foreign direct investment in Mexico this year to total around $25 billion, with investment in the energy and telecommunications sectors expected to more than make up for the loss of a planned $1.6 billion Ford Motor Co. F.N factory that the company said this month it is cancelling. Trump had strongly criticized the plan, but Ford said its decision was not the result of pressure from Trump.Guajardo also praised the government of Japan and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T for their ""reasonable"" response to Trump's threat to impose a significant border tax if the company does not stop making its Corolla model in Mexico for the U.S. market. Toyota said last week the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico. “Toyota has 10 plants in the United States... and employs more than 130,000 Americans. If I were Mr. Trump, I’d treat them with more respect,�� Guajardo said.He added that he expects total foreign direct investment during the six-year term of President Enrique Pena Nieto, which ends in late 2018, to average $30 billion annually.Guajardo has previously warned that U.S. corporate tax cuts proposed by Trump, as well as the border tax, could undermine foreign investment in Latin America’s No. 2 economy.Mexico slapped a tax on U.S. high fructose corn syrup in the early 2000s after the United States refused to allow free trade in Mexican sugar."	-3.614559581
NOIDA, India, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will this week begin talks with Daihatsu Motor to build and sell small cars in India, as part of its efforts to get a 10 percent share of the passenger vehicle market by 2025, a company executive said.A decision is likely to be taken by end of this year, said Kyoichi Tanada, Toyota’s CEO of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. He did not give a timeline for the Daihatsu cars launch in India.The world’s biggest carmaker is to buy its remaining stake in Daihatsu as part of a strategy to strengthen its push into compact cars for emerging markets like India, where rival Maruti Suzuki dominates with its low-cost cars.“In order to fight in the small car market we need more support from Daihatsu... Toyota by ourselves cannot develop it (small cars),�� Tanada told Reuters. “From my area view point I would like to set up the brand in India first.�� (Reporting by Aditi Shah; Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee)	-5.582290664
* Full-year 2011 sales up 8.8 pct - KBA* Volkswagen, BMW retain biggest share of German market* Toyota, Kia increase market shareFRANKFURT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - German car sales rose 6.1 percent in December as consumers brushed off an uncertain economic environment and bought more compact cars, high-margin vans and luxury saloons.That helped secure growth of 8.8 percent for 2011, German motor vehicle authority KBA said on Tuesday.“Germany’s car market was more stable in 2011 than many expected,�� automotive association VDA President Matthias Wissmann said in a separate statement.Western Europe’s car market is seen stagnating in 2012 at best, as consumer demand eases amid weaker economic growth, though data in Germany has raised some hopes that Europe’s biggest economy may buck the trend.Germany’s Volkswagen and BMW retained leadership in their home market in 2011, with respective market share standing at 20 percent and 11.2 percent in December, according to KBA data.Shares of BMW rose to the top of the German blue-chip index , gaining 4.4 percent, while Daimler was up 4 percent and Volkswagen traded 2.3 percent higher. The STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles &amp; Parts was up 3 percent.Asian rivals Toyota and Kia gained ground in Germany, expanding their shares to 3.5 percent and 1.8 percent in December, compared with 2.6 percent and 1.3 percent for the full year, helped by robust demand for compact cars.Ford, Renault and Fiat, however, saw market share shrink during the year, to 7.1 percent, 4.5 percent and 2 percent, respectively.The news on Germany’s car market comes a day after data showed new car sales in Italy dived 15.3 percent in December.U.S. new-vehicle sales for December are expected to show continued steady growth, but analysts say much of the gains are linked to buyers who delayed purchases, and therefore should not be seen as indicative of a strengthening economy.BMW Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner told a German newspaper he expects growth opportunities in the U.S. and China to help offset a flat European car market this year.German auto exports shrank 1 percent, but the VDA said foreign demand held up well as new orders from abroad increased by 10 percent.“We are already at a high level that is not easy to top,�� VDA President Wissmann said.“But we have reason for cautious optimism for the car market in 2012,�� he said, adding financial market stabilisation would be crucial.	11.74923279
(Repeats with no changes)TORONTO, July 16 (Reuters) - Canadian government customs provisions are expected to soften the blow on the country’s powerful automotive industry from retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, according to trade lawyers and industry leaders bracing for higher costs.Decades-old programs reduce or refund import duties on supplies like steel when companies in Canada can show the material is used in export products. They could protect the auto industry’s supply contracts covering raw materials and parts, which often cross borders several times before a vehicle is finished.While imposing tariffs against a long list of U.S. products this month, Canada clarified that “duties relief�� and “duty drawback�� programs would be available to Canadian exporters.“That provision in the notice is overwhelmingly directed at the auto industry,�� said Jesse Goldman, a trade lawyer at Borden Ladner Gervais. Without drawbacks, Goldman said, the Canadian retaliation would have “very significantly and very quickly�� hurt the industry.Some 85 percent of vehicles built in Canada in 2016 were exported, meaning duty relief programs could refund roughly 85 percent of retaliatory tariffs paid by automakers.Canada has vowed to defend the steel and aluminum industries, but vehicle manufacturing employs some 136,000, according to Statistics Canada, whereas only about 22,000 work in the steel sector, giving the government an incentive to shelter vehicle and parts makers from rising costs.“These existing programs continue to be in place and any changes would be done in consultation with the relevant stakeholders,�� federal Finance Department spokesman Jack Aubry said when asked whether the programs would continue.Automakers with operations in Canada include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co which assemble vehicles, as well as parts makers Magna International and Linamar Corp.Linamar Chief Executive Linda Hasenfratz said in an emailed statement the drawback programs are of particular benefit to her company, Canada’s second largest auto parts maker, since substantially all the steel that the company imports is later exported.Honda said it was still assessing the impact of the tariffs. GM, Fiat Chrysler and Magna declined to comment. Ford and Toyota did not respond to requests for comment.The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers�� Association needs to do more analysis before commenting on whether drawbacks could protect his industry, President Mark Nantais said. “There are various options that could be used - that would be one of them,�� he added.But any relief would be temporary if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on Canadian-made vehicles after the administration’s Section 232 national security probe into autos wraps up. The rebate programs limit the impact of tariffs on raw materials, not finished products.Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers�� Association, said some companies that make stainless steel parts or hardened steel tools in Canada could benefit.Volpe said just over half of Canadian-made auto parts are exported.John Boscariol, who leads McCarthy Tetrault’s international trade and investment law group, said access to the duty relief programs had not been a foregone conclusion before the government’s notice, because Canada’s retaliation is technically a “surtax,�� not a normal duty.Some uncertainty remains as companies must apply individually for the refunds, and carefully document how imports are used, he added.“It introduces costs and complications, and it introduces a likelihood that you might not get that relief,�� Boscariol said. “That’s not without cost.�� (Reporting by Allison Martell Editing by Denny Thomas and Richard Chang)	-6.610878661

STUTTGART, Germany (Reuters) - Porsche's VOWG_p.DE pursuit of record profit may suffer a setback this year as costs of new models and technology eat into gains from rising sports car sales.The Volkswagen-owned division expects operating profit in 2014 to at least match the record 2.58 billion euros ($3.59 billion) of last year, which was up 6 percent on 2012 results, Porsche said at its annual press conference on Friday.Car sales may increase to a new record this year after growing 3 percent in the first two months to 23,286 vehicles, powered by the new Macan compact SUV due to hit dealerships in April, according to Chief Executive Matthias Mueller.“This positive trend will strengthen over the course of 2014,�� he said at Porsche’s Stuttgart headquarters.However finance chief Lutz Meschke said the firm needed to shoulder high spending this year on emission-cutting technology as well as rising personnel costs as the new Macan model helped create 1,500 new jobs at its second German plant in Leipzig.Porsche was bought by VW, Europe's largest automotive group by volume, in 2012. Growth and profit at Porsche are a major part of VW's efforts to surpass Toyota 7203.T as the world's No. 1 carmaker by volume no later than 2018.Top managers at Porsche will soon be drawing up a new expansion plan stretching as far as five years beyond existing targets because the carmaker may hit a sales goal of 200,000 cars in 2015, three years earlier than expected, the CEO said last month.	-3.027017259

July 23 (Reuters) - Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp and Toyota Motor Corp have agreed to raise steel sheet prices by about 10 percent for April-September as yen falls, the Nikkei reported.Negotiations between the world’s second-biggest steelmaker and the best-selling carmaker serve as a benchmark for Japanese steel sellers for contracts with automakers, shipbuilders and other manufacturers.The 10,000 yen a ton price increase from the previous six months will be applied retroactively to shipments since April, the paper said.The dollar and euro have gained about 15 percent against the yen so far this year on expectations of aggressive monetary easing in Japan.Nippon Steel has said its margin have been squeezed in recent years as the company could not pass on higher costs of raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal to manufacturers.Toyota, which is set to gain from higher export margins due to the weaker yen, will offset this hike in its raw material steel prices through restructuring instead of increasing new-vehicle prices, the business daily said.The Nikkei did not give further details of Toyota’s plans.Nippon Steel lags behind only ArcelorMittal in steel output and competes with South Korea’s POSCO in the region.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is recalling about 242,000 gas-electric hybrid vehicles worldwide, including the bestselling Prius model, due to a brake design flaw, the automaker said on Wednesday.Toyota is recalling the Prius produced between March and October 2009, and the Lexus HS 250h made between June and October 2009, spokeswoman Shino Yamada said.The recalled vehicles could experience greater stopping distances when braking because of a mechanical design flaw in a brake part, Yamada said.That part, the brake pressure accumulator, could crack with fatigue and release nitrogen gas into the brake fluid, she said, adding that no accidents, injuries or deaths have been reported as a result of the defect.Toyota is recalling 113,550 Prius vehicles in Japan. In the United States, it is recalling 81,570 Prius cars and 5,030 of the HS 250h, Yamada said.The company will exchange the faulty part with a new one, which will take around three hours, she said.In 2010, Toyota, an leader in gas-electric hybrid technology, recalled 433,000 hybrid vehicles including the Prius and HS 250h because of a braking software glitch.In a gas-electric hybrid vehicle, a battery captures energy from the brakes to supplement the combustion engine, boosting overall mileage, particularly in stop-go city traffic.As of end March, the company had sold about 5.1 million hybrid vehicles globally, including 3.6 million Prius vehicles, since it went on sale in December 1997.	9.053712893

BEIJING, July 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two Chinese joint ventures sold about 71,000 vehicles in China in June, down 7.6 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday.That followed a 2.7 percent year-on-year rise in May and a 12.4 percent increase in April.In the first six months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker sold about 465,900 vehicles, up 11.7 percent from a year earlier.Toyota this year aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China. If accomplished, this would see the carmaker surpass annual sales of 1 million vehicles in China for the first time, a target it originally aimed for in 2010.Last year, Toyota sold 917,500 vehicles in China.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group .

TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Wednesday said it had agreed to a more modest wage rise than last year, as uncertainties about the global business environment prompt the Japanese automaker to tighten its purse strings.The company announced an average monthly base wage increase of 1,300 yen ($11.32) for the financial year beginning in April, 13 percent lower than the previous year’s rise and less than half the union’s demand.Toyota's increase was the smallest among Japan's top three automakers, trailing a 1,500 yen raise agreed at Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, which was also lower than last year, and Honda Motor Co 7267.T which matched last year's 3,000 yen raise. As the lowest increase in Toyota’s four-year run of pay hikes, it reflects the nationwide trend of slugging wage growth and casts doubt on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to boost the economy through domestic consumption.“Considering the uncertainties ahead and earnings prospects, it was difficult to agree to an increase along the lines of last year’s,�� Tatsuro Ueda, chief officer of general administration and human resources at Toyota, told reporters.The agreement by the country’s largest automaker, which is considered a bellwether in the country’s annual wage negotiations, fell short of demands by its union for an annual increase of 3,000 yen, and is lower than last year’s 1,500 yen rise and 4,000 yen in 2015.	-6.287530908
TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - Japan will offer at least 2 million yen ($19,700) in subsidies for fuel-cell vehicles, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said according to media, as the government and Japanese carmakers including Toyota Motor Corp join forces to speed up the introduction the vehicles.The subsidy would mean that consumers would pay about 5 million yen for Toyota’s fuel-cell sedan, which is set to go on sale by the end of March 2015 and priced at about 7 million yen.Abe, who visited a hydrogen station and test-drove fuel-cell cars on Friday, vowed to back the technology through subsidies and the purchase of the cars by government agencies.“This is the car of a new era because it doesn’t emit any carbon dioxide and it’s environmentally friendly,�� Abe told reporters. “The government needs to support this.”Abe’s growth strategy promotes the use of hydrogen energy and fuel-cell cars, which use hydrogen as fuel and run on electricity from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen and emit only water vapour and heat, though some carbon dioxide is emitted when hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons.Honda Motor Co is also set to start selling its fuel-cell vehicle in 2015.Both the government and many industry experts reckon the technology could take decades to become widely used partly because of the costs of building up infrastructure of hydrogen fuel stations.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor said on Wednesday it will sell 1,000 hydrogen-powered trucks in Switzerland over the next five years through a new tie-up, betting the vehicles could beat battery-powered models sold by the likes of Tesla Inc.South Korea’s Hyundai and Japan’s Toyota are among a handful of car makers doubling down on hydrogen vehicles amid an intensifying global race to develop greener technologies to replace combustion engines, as regulators around the world crack down on emissions.The deal, which will double Hyundai’s hydrogen vehicle sales, marks its latest push into a technology that has lagged battery electric vehicles. Hyundai, whose profits have tumbled due to a heavy reliance on low-demand sedans, hopes to burnish its brand image by taking the lead in hydrogen cars.On Wednesday, Hyundai said in a statement it will partner with Swiss hydrogen company H2 Energy and fuel cell operators to provide 1,000 hydrogen trucks in the country after launching at the end of 2019 what it says will be the world’s first commercial hydrogen trucks. It did not provide any financial details.The launch timeline is ahead of battery-powered trucks Tesla and Daimler plan to introduce in 2020 and 2021, respectively.Hyundai announced a partnership with Audi in June to share each other’s hydrogen car technology and components to bring down production costs and make the technology profitable.For long-haul, hydrogen trucks have a huge advantage over battery rivals as heavy batteries can reduce cargo capacity and require longer charging times, Mark Freymueller, a commercial vehicle director at Hyundai Motor, told Reuters. Hyundai said its hydrogen trucks are expected to deliver a single-fueling travel range of around 400 kilometers.“We are not planning just purely 1,000 vehicles and then stop the business... We expect that much more is coming afterwards,�� he said, adding Hyundai would look at launching it in the United States, China and other European countries.Freymueller said expanding into other markets, however, will depend on finding partners such as pump operators and hydrogen suppliers.The uptake of hydrogen cars, which are propelled by electricity generated by fuel cells, has been held back by a lack of infrastructure, which costs 3 billion won ($2.7 million) each to build in South Korea.Hyundai Motor launched the industry’s first mass-produced hydrogen car Tucson Fuel Cell in 2013, followed by NEXO this year. It has sold about 1,140 fuel cell vehicles so far, while Toyota sold 6,700 Mirai hydrogen cars since its launch in 2014.Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors are hedging their bets on hydrogen cars with a plan to release 14 battery electric vehicles by 2025.($1 = 1,120.3300 won)	-6.282513005
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said on Friday he welcomed the cooperation between Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T on producing cars with next-generation technology.Seko, speaking to reporters, said he was sure the tie-up between the two companies would contribute to the development of electronic vehicles.He also said the government would consider ways to support the spread of next-generation cars including electric, plug-in hybrids and cars running on fuel cells.Toyota and Mazda announced on Friday they would build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant as part of a new joint venture, while Toyota would take a 5 percent stake in its smaller rival.	-0.4468588452

MEXICO CITY, April 2 (Reuters) - Japanese car giant Toyota Motor Corp is planning two new factories in Mexico and China, at a cost of 150 billion yen ($1.25 billion), Nikkei reported on Thursday.The Mexican plant will be based in the central state of Guanajuato, and have a capacity of 200,000 cars a year, Nikkei said, adding that it would build a new version of the Corolla sedan for the North American market.The Chinese plant will be in the city of Guangzhou and will produce up to 100,000 Yaris subcompacts a year, Nikkei said.The Chinese plant would open in 2018, while the Mexican factory would open in 2019, Nikkei said.Last month, Reuters reported that Toyota’s board was finalizing plans for the Mexican plant, which would represent an investment of over $1 billion.The new plants would signal an end to a 3-year expansion freeze imposed by the Japanese auto maker’s president, Akio Toyoda, who has blamed aggressive expansion a decade ago for contributing to quality lapses and a 2009 recall crisis.Source text (s.nikkei.com/1yGCLKD)	-0.4124004551
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s car industry will try to avoid suspending operations during the coronavirus pandemic, but worker safety takes priority, said its automakers�� association, adding the industry was considering financial support for struggling firms.Japanese carmakers have suspended some production operations at home, while most of their plants abroad have been shut as demand for cars has slumped and lockdowns and “shelter at home�� orders have kept plant employees away from work.“So long as there is demand, and it is safe for workers to work, we would like to see the country’s plants remain in operation,�� Akio Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automotive Manufacturers�� Association, told a media conference.He added that the Japanese auto industry should preserve as many jobs as possible to ensure that automakers and their suppliers would be prepared to resume full operation for an eventual recovery from the virus outbreak.Toyoda, who also serves as president of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, said that automakers along with vehicle components, autobody and machine tools makers were considering setting up a fund to offer financial support to struggling companies. Like their global rivals, Japanese automakers are struggling to contain the impact of the virus, preserving cash where they can and seeking additional funding.Toyota and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T have tapped their lenders for additional credit lines, sources from both companies have told Reuters.	1.946231239
(Adds postponement of VAT payments, Grand Bazaar closure)ISTANBUL, March 23 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira slipped 0.8% on Monday to its lowest level since September 2018, as a surge in domestic coronavirus cases set the stage for a potentially sharp economic slowdown spanning tourism, manufacturing and the vast services sector.The lira stood at 6.5985 against the dollar by 1323 GMT, weakening from 6.5480 on Friday and was set for a sixth slide in the last eight trading days. It has lost 10% so far this year, nearly matching losses in a volatile 2019.As of Sunday, Turkey’s death toll from the coronavirus had reached 30, with 1,236 confirmed cases. Turkey has suspended flights to some 70 countries, closed schools, cafes and bars, banned mass prayers and postponed sports matches and events.With most Turks staying at home to help curb the outbreak, the strong growth of the last few months looks set to cool quickly, as automakers temporarily shut their factories and banks eased payment rules on loans.Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said on Monday that VAT payments due on March 26 had been postponed till April 24.“The global flight from risk and flow towards the dollar is very strong due to coronavirus. We too cannot determine where this will end,�� one forex trader said, noting some other emerging-market currencies had logged twice the lira’s losses.“The public sector’s dollar supply and oil prices have been instrumental in this,�� the trader added.A currency crisis that peaked in August 2018 pushed the Turkish economy into recession, but it recovered strongly in the latter part of last year. In total the lira lost 36% of its value in the previous two years.Lenders including Ziraat Bank, Vakifbank, Halkbank and Isbank announced some flexible loan payment options and some offered possible restructuring for corporate debt, especially to the hard-hit tourism and transportation sectors.The lira, which weakened as far as 6.6075, recovered some losses after the U.S. Federal Reserve mounted an extraordinary new array of programs to offset what it called “severe disruptions�� to the economy caused by the virus.Turkey’s main share index recovered some of the day’s losses after the Fed move and was down 1.11%, while the banking index was 4.3% weaker.The consumer confidence index rose to a still-depressed 58.2 points in March, while foreign arrivals for February rose by 4.46%, official data showed.Turkish Airlines shares fell 2.6% after it said on Sunday that 85% of its passenger planes were not being used.The airline - which says it flies to more destinations than any other carrier - will halt all its international flights as of March 27 except those to Hong Kong, Moscow, Addis Ababa, New York and Washington.The automotive industry, which accounts for a fifth of Turkey’s export revenue, was also hit as several large manufacturers halted production for two weeks because of supply disruptions and market conditions.Among them were Ford Motor Co’s commercial vehicle hub Ford Otosan, Toyota’s SUV plant and CNH Industrial’s tractor plant Turk Traktor.Turkish auto parts producers association TAYSAD saw a 20% decrease in exports as their biggest clients in Europe halted factories, with 80% of members slowing manufacturing this week.Istanbul’s historic Grand Bazaar also shut on Monday as part of the measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, broadcaster NTV said.	4.581005587

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is recalling more than 400,000 vehicles in Saudi Arabia that were produced from 2006 to 2010 due to concerns about unintended acceleration, the company and Saudi Arabia's trade ministry said.This is the same issue that led to the recall of nearly 19 million Toyota vehicles worldwide from late 2009 to early 2011.Toyota and its agent in Saudi Arabia, Abdul Latif Jameel Co, will install brake override systems in the affected vehicles, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Commerce and Industry said in a statement this week.This is the second country, after the United States, where installation of the brake override system to prevent runaway Toyota vehicles has been required, the statement said.Toyota in an emailed statement said that its main Toyota brand and luxury Lexus brand vehicles “are safe even without�� a brake override system.Regulators in the United States in 2011 found that there was no electronic-based cause of unintended high-speed acceleration in Toyota vehicles.But, Toyota said it recalled the vehicles in Saudi Arabia to “ensure customers�� peace of mind�� and after the trade ministry’s “strong request�� that software for a brake override system be installed, Toyota said in its emailed statement.The Toyota brake override system automatically counteracts any instances of unintended acceleration, including cutting power to the engine.The recall in Saudi Arabia affects seven Toyota brand and three Lexus brand vehicles from model years 2005 to 2011.	-3.567897165

* Toyota’s Durban plant hit by four-day walkout* Three more Amplats mines closed; police fire teargas* Kumba Iron Ore stops output at giant Sishen pit* Talks to end truck drivers�� strike collapseBy Wendell RoelfCAPE TOWN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it had been forced to shut its South African car factory for four days because of an illegal pay strike, the first sign of wildcat mine stoppages spreading into other parts of Africa’s biggest economy.Trade union leaders at the Japanese car giant’s Durban plant said workers would return on Friday after winning a 5.4 percent pay rise inspired in part by a hefty increase won last month by strikers at Lonmin’s Marikana platinum mine.“The circumstances are not the same as what is happening in the mines,�� said Mbuso Ngubane of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA).“But it does send a message. It does have an impact to some extent on other workers getting agitated.”After two months of unrest, at least 75,000 miners, or 15 percent of the sector’s workforce, are on strike, compounding already sluggish growth just three months before an internal leadership vote in the ruling African National Congress (ANC).President Jacob Zuma is the favourite to win re-election, teeing him up for a second five-year term in 2014, but the turbulence strengthens the hand of those who say he is unfit to run a sophisticated emerging economy.Zuma has been criticised for his relatively low-key response to the crisis, including the Aug. 16 police killing of 34 strikers at Marikana - the bloodiest police action in the post-apartheid era.In a speech to business leaders on Thursday he sought to play down the negative impact of the strikes.“We should not seek to portray ourselves as a nation that is perpetually fighting,�� he said.“Some may become pessimistic when ... tragic incidents such as Marikana take place. There’s no reason to be despondent. We have the capacity to overcome difficulties when we work together as South Africans.”On Thursday, Kumba Iron Ore, one of the world’s top 10 producers, said it had suspended production at its huge Sishen mine after striking employees blocked access to the pit.Wildcat industrial action at the world’s top platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum (Amplats), spread from its four mines near Rustenburg, 120 km (75 miles) northwest of Johannesburg, to three mines 100 km further north, a union official said.Police near Rustenburg used teargas and a water cannon on Thursday to disperse protesters who were hurling stones and burning tyres. Thulani Ngubane, a local police spokesman, told Reuters that no one had been arrested or injured.Local radio said about 2,000 striking workers had taken part in the protest, but Ngubane disputed that, saying only around 150 people had been present. He said they were members of the community, not strikers.The seven Amplats plants account for a quarter of global supply of the precious metal, whose price has risen more than 22 percent since the Marikana killing.Overnight, police said suspected wildcat strikers had burnt down two conveyors and a training centre at an Amplats mine in Rustenburg.South African gold producers AngloGold Ashanti and Gold Fields said on Thursday they had agreed to reopen wage talks for entry-level workers, a sign they may be moving closer to resolving costly strikes.But talks to end a legal strike by more than 20,000 truck drivers collapsed after unions rejected an offer of an 18 percent pay rise over two years, the Road Freight Employers�� Association said.Fuel suppliers are having to use police convoys to prevent drivers being attacked by gangs trying to enforce a blockade that is putting petrol stations at risk of running dry.Although South Africa’s racially-polarised labour market is prone to industrial action, the aftermath of the so-called “Marikana massacre�� has blown apart normal negotiating procedure and exposed the weakness of established unions.The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), a close ally of the ANC, is in talks with the big mining houses to try to stop the strikes.“This, we hope, will save collective bargaining, save industrial relations in the country while at the same time bringing workers and their demands on board,�� COSATU General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said.But COSATU is making little headway after losing much of its influence in the last 12 months.“You are going to see quite a lot more of these wildcat strikes,�� said Chris Hart, chief strategist at asset managers Investment Solutions.“Despite there being a whole lot of issues which are separate and distinct from Marikana, there is a sense that if you go on the rampage outside the collective bargaining system you get more benefits.”Fallout from the unrest in the mines, which account for 6 percent of GDP, has put pressure on the rand, which has fallen towards a three-year low against the dollar. It has also fuelled concern about growth, forecast by the government at 2.7 percent this year.	4.697554698
DETROIT, Aug 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it is slashing the price of its Chevrolet Volt electric car by $5,000 to help boost demand for the plug-in hybrid in a segment still struggling to gain a foothold in the U.S. auto market.The price cut for the 2014 model will lower the price to $34,995, including delivery fees before federal tax credits. Pricing could fall as low as $27,495 with the tax credit.“We have made great strides in reducing costs as we gain experience with electric vehicles and their components,�� Don Johnson, U.S. vice president for Chevy sales, said in a statement.GM did not quantify the cost savings for the 2014 model, but has said the next version of the Volt, due in 2015, will cost $7,000 to $10,000 less. The 2014 models will begin arriving at dealer stores later this month.“Chevrolet has quickly discovered that when price savings at the pump and ultimately value are your key selling points, a $40,000 cost of entry makes for a difficult hurdle to overcome for most budget conscious consumers,�� Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Alec Gutierrez said. He expects GM to roll out aggressively priced lease deals on the new Volt.The 2014 Volt will offer consumers the equivalent fuel economy of 98 miles per gallon on electric power and 40 miles per gallon when powered by its gasoline engine. The car can drive almost 40 miles on its electric charge, with 380 miles of total driving range.Several automakers have slashed prices on their electric cars to help overcome consumer qualms about high costs and fears about driving range, and are pushing to develop the technology in hopes the vehicles could become a bigger seller as fuel-efficiency requirements rise globally.Through July, sales of electric vehicles in the United States had more than doubled from last year to almost 49,000 vehicles, according to website hybridcars.com, but still only 0.54 percent of the overall market. In the same period, Volt sales were up 9 percent to 11,643 vehicles.In January, Nissan Motor Co cut the price of its Leaf EV by more than $6,000, and in May Honda Motor Co slashed the lease price of its electric-powered Fit subcompact car by one-third. In July, Ford Motor Co reduced the price of its 2014 electric Focus by 10 percent.GM had cut the price of the 2013 model Volt by $5,000 to help boost demand. In late May it launched the Chevy Spark electric vehicle with a lower-than-expected starting price of $27,495 and is offering discounted leases on both cars.The Volt price cut is another step in GM’s effort to seize the mantle of “greenest automaker in the world�� from Toyota Motor Corp , which makes the popular Prius hybrid car. Toyota also sells a plug-in version of the Prius.GM is aiming by 2017 to build up to 500,000 vehicles a year with some form of electric engine power, including the Volt, Spark EV and those with its eAssist system that boost fuel efficiency in gas-powered cars.GM will begin building the Cadillac ELR plug-in electric couple late this year.	-1.575729069

* Calendar 2013 sales forecast for 1.36 mln autos -media* Sales drop in home market adds to China woes* Shares up 0.4 pct at midday, in line with NikkeiTOKYO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects Japan vehicle sales to fall by a fifth next year, in part due to the end of government tax incentives for fuel-efficient automobiles, domestic media reported, adding to the pain from a decline in China sales.Japanese vehicle sales account for 30 percent of Toyota’s total sales volumes, and industry data shows that since the end of government tax incentives for purchases of fuel-efficient cars in mid-September, domestic new vehicle sales have fallen each of the past three months.Toyota has decided to set its 2013 domestic sales target for Toyota-brand cars at 1.36 million vehicles, down from its 1.67 million target for this year, the Mid-Japan Economist, a regional newspaper, said on its website without citing sources.It noted that a backlog of orders following supply-chain disruptions from last year’s earthquake and tsunami had inflated sales this year.A Toyota spokesman said nothing has been decided about its 2013 domestic sales target.Last month, Toyota cut its group-wide global 2012 sales forecast, which includes Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd and Hino Motors Ltd, to 9.66 million vehicles from a previous outlook of 9.76 million vehicles, following declines in China sales on a bilateral territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea.This week, it said sales in China, the world’s biggest auto market, fell 22 percent in November from a year earlier which follows drops of 44 percent in October and nearly 50 percent in September.Toyota shares stood 0.4 percent higher at the midday break, in line with a 0.2 percent rise for the benchmark Nikkei 225 .	10.95238095
* Ban to run until March 31* Campaigners hope to extend it to other Indian cities* Mercedez-Benz says ban to impact future investment in India* Shares in carmakers extend losses (Adds comments from Mercedes-Benz India, Tata Motors)By Aditi ShahNEW DELHI, Dec 16 (Reuters) - India’s top court has ordered a temporary ban on the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi to combat toxic smog in the city, prompting concern in the auto sector as some carmakers say they may reconsider investment plans in the country.According to an order passed on Wednesday, the registration of sport-utility vehicles and other diesel cars with an engine capacity of 2,000 cc or more is banned in Delhi and the surrounding region with immediate effect until March 31.Delhi’s crackdown on diesel cars has unsettled the industry, its salesmen and investors, who warn the ban and uncertainty around it could derail a tentative recovery in Indian sales and leave dealers with forecourts packed with unsold cars.Environmental campaigners and the lawyer who brought the case to the Supreme Court, however, say they want to see the order extended beyond the capital to other smog-choked cities.Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, for whom the Delhi region represents almost a quarter of sales in the country, told Reuters the diesel ban and the uncertainty around it would “severely impact�� growth plans and future investment in India.“We also have to consider the loss of jobs that this will result (in) at the dealerships, at the vendors producing diesel engines,�� a spokesman said in an emailed statement, adding its own workers would be affected.The court - which said the order would not hit India’s “common man�� - stopped short of banning the smaller cars that clog India’s roads. But it did also prohibit trucks from passing through the city to reach other states and banned all trucks over 10 years old from the capital.An existing charge imposed on trucks making deliveries to Delhi itself was doubled to up to 2,600 rupees ($39).Other measures include a demand for all taxis in Delhi, mainly those operated by Uber and local rival Ola, to replace diesel with natural gas, as well as a broad, immediate ban on burning solid waste.In January, the judges will also consider an application to levy a green tax on all diesel cars sold in the country.Environmentalists have cheered Wednesday’s moves, but analysts questioned the detail of the ban.“The (higher truck) levy will just go back to whoever is hiring the trucks. So eventually the consumer ends up paying the levy and inhaling the gas fumes,�� said Deepesh Rathore, director at consultant Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors.India’s National Green Tribunal, an environmental court, last week ordered a ban on the registration of all diesel vehicles for nearly four weeks to help clean up the air in Delhi, one of the world’s most polluted cities.That triggered a share price fall among automakers which have invested heavily in diesel technology in India. The drop steepened after the Supreme Court’s order.Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, India’s top utility-vehicle maker, was one of the biggest losers with shares down 5.5 percent. It said the ban would affect roughly 2 percent of its total monthly sales.Rivals such as Tata Motors and Toyota Motor Corp , the world’s top-selling carmaker, also have popular large cars. Greater Delhi contributes 8 percent of Toyota’s sales and 80 percent of vehicles sold in this region are diesel.India’s auto industry body called for a comprehensive plan, which should include a policy to remove and scrap old vehicles.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The former deputy head of China’s top planning agency confessed in court on Wednesday to extensive bribery involving several companies including a Toyota Motor Corp. joint venture, the court said.Liu Tienan, 59, was sacked as deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a post that carries ministerial-level status, in May last year. He is one of the highest-profile officials to be prosecuted for corruption since President Xi Jinping launched an anti-graft campaign.Prosecutors charged Liu and his son, Liu Decheng, with taking 35.6 million yuan ($5.8 million) in bribes in dealings with various companies, including the Toyota joint venture, the court said.The NDRC is a powerful body that sets broad economic policies and approves major investments. Liu was also head of the National Energy Administration regulator.“The oral representation made by the defendant Liu Tienan on the allegations is: I have taken the initiative to confess to the facts of the allegations,�� the court said on its microblog as it laid out the charges against Liu.The closely watched trial in being held in Langfang city in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing.Liu was sacked after a deputy editor-in-chief of the investigative magazine Caijing posted accusations on his microblog that Liu was involved in illegal activities.He was the first ministerial-level official to face an investigation after Xi became Communist Party head in late 2012 and pledged to take down high-ranking “tigers�� and low-ranking “flies�� in his fight against a pervasive problem he says could threaten Communist Party rule.Liu broke into tears as he confessed and apologized for his crimes in his closing statement, the court said.“I’m so sorry that I worked more than 30 years at the NDRC, with the trust of the leaders and my comrades, and smeared a black mark on my workplace,�� Liu was quoted as saying. “I am completely and bitterly remorseful.”�I’ve harmed myself with my corrupt actions, harmed my child, and destroyed my family,�� he said.Liu is the third ministerial-level official to stand trial for graft, according to Chinese media.Under Chinese law, Liu could face the death sentence if convicted of corruption. But the public prosecutor said in an opinion that Liu had been cooperative in handing over evidence to investigators so the court would be lenient.“Liu Tiennan, after his case was opened, positively assisted the organizations handling the case in their work, and his attitude was good in admitting and regretting his crimes,�� the prosecutor stated.Liu is certain to be found guilty as the Communist Party controls the courts, which do not challenge party accusations, especially in graft cases.Prosecutors said Liu, together with his son, facilitated deals on projects that included the sale of 30,000 tonnes of aluminum oxide to the Nanshan Group, parent of Shandong Nanshan Aluminium Co. Ltd..In return, the father and son were paid bribes of 7.5 million yuan by Song Zuowen, chairman of Nanshan Group, the court heard.In 2002, Liu Tienan, as a senior official in the top economic planning agency, had helped Nanshan Group get approval for an alloy project after a request from Song, according to the court.In 2005, Liu Tienan accepted a request from Sun Yonggen, chairman of the Ningbo ZhongJin Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to approve a petrochemical plant, the court said. In return, Sun bought Liu Decheng a car for 336,000 yuan.Liu also put Zhang Aibin, the controlling shareholder of a car dealership in Beijing, in touch with Zhang Fangyou, the chairman of GAC Toyota Motor Co.

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak group InoBat and U.S. energy tech firm Wildcat Discovery Technologies will build a 100 million euro ($111 million) automotive battery production line in Slovakia, with the aim of meeting future demand from central Europe’s carmakers.The companies said on Friday construction on the 100 MWh line, able to produce 1,500 batteries annually initially, should start in the first half of 2020 and distribution will begin by the end of 2021.Eventually, they said, they wanted to upgrade the line to 10 GWh in the long term, boosting capacity to 150,000 batteries.��(Wildcat’s) proprietary technology has the potential to revolutionize the entire European electric vehicle batteries industry,�� InoBat co-founder Marian Bocek said in a statement.The companies are in talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB), they said.Wildcat develops technology combining high throughput experimentation (HTP) and artificial intelligence, and has worked with both automakers and consumer electronics groups, including Toyota and Samsung Electronics.The car sector is increasingly shifting to electric and the European Union is seeking to support battery production.The electric car battery production line would be the first in Slovakia, which is the world’s biggest per-capita car producer. Central Europe is home to several car plants, making the sector important to the region’s economies.South Korean battery maker LG Chem has already set up a production base in Poland while SK Innovation is due to launch in Hungary, where Samsung SDI is already.	-0.7211720944
(Reuters) - A federal grand jury has returned a 14-count indictment accusing a Lions Gate employee and another man of cheating the film and television studio of $2 million through kickbacks and fake advertising over five years.Roccio James Cuccia, a senior buyer for Lions Gate Entertainment Inc, and Larry Collins, a vendor, were indicted Thursday and then arrested Friday by federal agents on charges of wire fraud and tax evasion.Cuccia was hired as a senior buyer in 2006 in charge of securing cardboard advertising cases that display Lions Gate DVDs and Blue Ray disks at retail stores and hired Collins to supply the displays, the indictment said.The indictment accuses Cuccia of bypassing supervisors to inflate the size of the orders from Collins who then issued fake purchase orders to secure payments from Lions Gate.Lions Gate then paid the inflated orders to a third party, which wired a substantial portion to Collins, who then kicked back a portion to Cuccia’s bank account, the indictment said.Ten counts in the indictment cover wire transfers to Collins totaling about $746,000 from October 2009 to December 2010.Cuccia is accused in the indictment of using money from the scheme to buy a used 2007 Toyota Camry hybrid in late 2009 and a used Mercedes Benz R350 in September 2010.Cuccia and Collins were granted bond after an initial appearance before a federal magistrate on Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.	-4.291641968
TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday said it would restart production at most of its assembly plants in Japan from April 25 following a series of earthquakes.Damage at plants in southern Japan operated by Aisin Seiki Co, one of Toyota’s major suppliers, led to a halt in production at virtually all of Toyota’s assembly plants this week due to shortages of parts for doors and engines.Toyota said production will remain suspended at two plants in southern Japan and a plant at its headquarters in central Japan through April 28.	-4.043872198
TOKYO, April 1 (Reuters) - Japan’s biggest bank has seen a surge in companies seeking funding due to the escalating coronavirus outbreak, with some 1,000 companies already asking for financing, the head of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s core unit said.Kanetsugu Mike also said he doesn’t see the outbreak as a financial crisis and that economic activity is likely to recover once the outbreak ends. Mike takes over as head of Japan’s banking lobby from April 1.His comments are some of the clearest yet on the impact of the coronavirus for companies in the world’s third-largest economy, showing how cash flow is increasingly a problem for many firms.“Corporate funding needs are rising. We have to swiftly meet the demand because their sales might vanish in some cases, not decrease gradually,�� Mike told Reuters in an interview embargoed until Wednesday.Policymakers are particularly worried about the impact on small and medium-sized firms as the crisis threatens to wipe out consumer demand. Bigger firms are also feeling the strain.Toyota Motor Corp, Japan’s biggest company by revenue and market value, has sought a credit line totalling 1 trillion yen, Kyodo reported.Airline operator ANA Holdings is considering a loan of around 100 billion yen ($927 million), Reuters reported last week, citing sources familiar with the matter.“Until the coronavirus situation comes to an end, the banking sector will make all possible efforts for financial facilitation along with the government’s policies,�� Mike said.

DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s namesake brand and its Lexus luxury brand finished one-and-two for the second year in a row in Consumer Reports�� annual quality survey of the U.S. new-vehicle market, the influential magazine said on Monday.The four lowest-scoring brands were all from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Chrysler Group, as were five of the bottom seven. Fiat scored the lowest of the 28 brands and the Fiat 500L was named the least reliable among 265 models included in the survey.The survey is seen as a key factor in influencing American car shoppers.Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports, said it seems Chrysler has been “picking less reliable partners�� as times goes on, from Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors Corp to German’s Daimler AG to Italy’s Fiat.However, poor results do not always translate into weaker sales. For instance, Chrysler’s brands have been at or near the bottom of the survey since at least 2009, while the group’s share of the U.S. market has risen to 12.2 percent this year through September from less than 9 percent in 2009.The biggest complaint about new cars and trucks is that infotainment systems do not work well.Infotainment systems include safety features, as well as satellite radio and hands-free telephone and internet capabilities, usually displayed on video screens on dashboards.Fisher said the complaints about infotainment systems are about how they perform after a driver understands them, not about them not being intuitive.The biggest gain in this year’s survey was by Ford Motor Co’s luxury Lincoln brand, up 12 spots to 15th place. The biggest drop was recorded by Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz because of a poor showing for its new CLA model.Fisher said Toyota brands perform well because the automaker takes a deliberate approach to introducing new features while others that forge ahead with developing technology, power train and design features have the greatest chance to disappoint.Ford performed miserably in the survey just a few years ago because of its “MyTouch�� infotainment systems. But the complaint rate for the system is much improved in this year’s survey, Fisher said.Japanese brands, which have dominated the survey in recent years, took the first four places, with Mazda Motor Corp third and Honda Motor Co fourth. Fifth was Volkswagen AG’s luxury brand Audi, followed by the lone domestic brand in the top 10, General Motors Co’s Buick at No. 6.Rounding out the top 10 were Fuji Heavy Industries�� Subaru , Toyota’s youth-oriented Scion, VW’s Porsche sports car brand and Kia Motors Corp’s namesake brand.The survey was completed out by 1.1 million consumers, down from 1.3 million in 2010.

LE MANS, France (Reuters) - Toyota made a smooth start to their bid for an historic first victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans on Saturday with the Japanese manufacturer’s cars reaching the three-hour mark in one-two formation.Starting from pole position on a hot afternoon at the Sarthe Circuit, the number seven Toyota with Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi at the wheel was leading the number eight of Britain’s Anthony Davidson by some 30 seconds.Porsche, chasing their third win in a row, held third and fourth places with their number one car 35 seconds off the pace in a largely incident-free opening period.Only one Japanese manufacturer has ever won Le Mans, Mazda in 1991 with a rotary-engined car, but Toyota - after 18 failed attempts - have set the pace this year.They have won the first two rounds of the world endurance championship and lined up for Le Mans on the back of a record qualifying lap.Ex-Formula One driver Kobayashi, who shares the seven car with Britain’s Mike Conway and Frenchman Stephane Sarrazin, lapped the circuit with the fastest time ever - an average speed of 251.882kph.Five-times runners-up Toyota came agonizingly close to winning last year but a last lap power failure on Kazuki Nakajima’s leading car handed the victory to Porsche.With once-dominant Audi pulling out of Le Mans after last year’s race, the 2017 edition is a straightforward battle between Porsche and Toyota.The only other entrant in the top LMP1 category, the number four ByKolles Racing ENSO CLM, retired after Britain’s Oliver Webb made contact with the wall on the opening lap.Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, who still holds the record for most Formula One races started, made his Le Mans debut in a Racing Team Nederland Dallara LMP2 car.In the process, the 45-year-old became the 40th driver to compete at all three of Le Mans, the Indianapolis 500 and Monaco Grand Prix.The race was started by Formula One chairman and chief executive Chase Carey waving a gold tasseled French flag with FIA head Jean Todt and Automobile Club de l’Ouest president Pierre Fillon in attendance.	5.062082139
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T on Wednesday unveiled an all-new Altima sedan, and demonstrated the auto industry's problem adjusting new-model investments fast enough to keep pace with shifts in consumer demand.The Altima, and rival midpriced sedans such as Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Camry and Honda Motor Co Ltd's 7267.T Accord, used to be high-volume sellers, keeping assembly lines rolling full-time. All three automakers several years ago committed to significant redesigns of their sedans.Since those investments were made, demand for midsized cars has collapsed in the United States due to the growing consumer appetite for larger SUVs and pickup trucks. Sales of sedans made up 36.8 percent of the U.S. market in 2017, down sharply from 51.2 percent in 2012.Through February this year, sedans made up 33.3 percent of new-vehicle sales and are down 12 percent versus the same period in 2017.Jack Hollis, Toyota’s North American head of sales and marketing, said the automaker expects by the end of 2018 sedans will make up around 30 percent of sales.Last summer, Honda launched its all-new Accord, arguing that the well-reviewed sedan would help it maintain sales levels in a declining market. Instead, sales of the new Accord dropped nearly 16 percent in February from a year ago. Honda said that between April and June it will halt production at its Marysville, Ohio, plant for 11 days to reduce a high inventory of unsold vehicles.Nissan executives at the New York auto show on Wednesday said the new Altima has a chance to buck the trend.“I think we’re going to have a hell of a lot of conquests in the segment,�� Denis Le Vot, who took over running Nissan’s North American operations earlier this year, told Reuters. “Not only from competing models, but also the whole market.”Nissan has added all-wheel drive, automatic rear braking and some autonomous features that help drivers stay in their lane or remain a set distance behind the vehicle in front to make the revamped Altima more attractive to consumers.Le Vot said automakers will have to add more features to remain competitive in the sedan segment. “Do we put more things in the car? Yes, because the market and the value of the market is going to that.”Rivals are shifting investments to trucks and sport utility vehicles. Intensifying competition among automakers to sell sedans should lead to higher discounts and narrower profits, said car-shopping website Autotrader’s executive publisher, Brian Moody.“That’s good news if you want to buy a sedan because you should be able to get a good deal,�� Moody said.Johan de Nysschen, head of General Motors Co's GM.N luxury Cadillac division, reiterated plans to cut the number of sedans in its family of vehicles and add sport utility vehicles and crossovers to its lineup.“Just as we are rebalancing our portfolio and reducing our number of sedan entries, so I imagine others will be doing the same,�� de Nysschen said on Wednesday. “The market just won’t sustain that many derivatives anymore.”The three big Japanese automakers, however, have large U.S. factories dedicated to midsized sedans such as the Altima, Camry and Accord.Toyota’s Hollis said Toyota remains committed to sedans.“We’re not pulling anything back, we will continue to invest,�� he said. “If other players want to pull out, fine, we’ll just take more market share.”Nissan’s Le Vot said the U.S. midsize sedan segment should stabilize at around 1.6 million units annually.“This is a very big playground and we have enough room in this playground to play with our car.��	0.4678990565
TOKYO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Japanese shares retreated to one-week lows on Thursday as doubts over an interim U.S.-China trade deal lifted the safe-haven yen, while Line Corp and Z Holdings surged on news that the Yahoo Japan operator was in merger talks with messaging app firm Line.The Nikkei share average dropped 0.2% to 23,263.96 by the midday break, its lowest since Nov. 7, and the broader Topix retreated 0.5% to 1,691.98, also a one-week low.Dashing upbeat expectations about a phase one deal was a Wall Street Journal report that said Sino-U.S. negotiations had “hit a snag�� over farm purchases, with Beijing not wanting a deal that looks one-sided in favour of the United States.In the cautious climate, the safe-haven yen firmed as high as 108.66 overnight and was last quoted at 108.79 against the dollar, weighing on Japanese exporters as a strong local currency hurts corporate profits when they are repatriated.Export-oriented Nissan Motor fell 2.2%, Honda Motor shed 1.4%, and Toyota Motor dropped 0.8%.Z Holdings, which last month changed its name from Yahoo Japan, soared 15.9% after the internet firm said merger discussions were underway with Line Corp.Shares in Line were untraded with a glut of buy orders, while SoftBank Corp, which owns almost half of Z Holdings, climbed 1.5%.The merger talks between Z Holdings and Line also put pressure on their competitors, with Rakuten Inc diving 5.5%.Z Holdings was the most traded stock on the main board, while SoftBank Corp was the third-most, and Rakuten was the sixth-most traded issues on the Topix.The information and telecom sector rose 0.6% to become the second-best performer among Tokyo’s 33 subsector indexes.Elsewhere, Toshiba Corp jumped 2.4% after the firm reported its highest quarterly profit in two years and said it would buy out three of its listed subsidiaries as the industrial conglomerate moves on from accounting scandals and a management crisis.

JOHANNESBURG, Sept 18 (Reuters) - South Africans�� love of large, gas-guzzling cars is taking a back seat in the face of record petrol prices, one of the more visible ways in which a sharp drop in the rand is changing the face of Africa’s largest economy.Car sales have been one of the few growth sectors this year as South Africa struggles to shake off the after-effects of a 2009 recession, but increasingly it is smaller, more efficient models that are finding their way onto the roads.A 16 percent fall in the rand against the dollar this year, including a four-year low of 10.51 last month, drove local petrol prices to a lifetime high of 13.55 rand a litre in August - more than double their levels in early 2009.As a result, South Africa’s total demand for petrol fell by a whopping 37 percent from April to July, according to import data, as people stayed at home, shared rides or traded down to cheaper vehicles.“Where people are more affluent, they are trading out of your luxury cars or big sedans into SUVs like the Fortuner, and again the trend is towards diesel,�� said Toyota spokesperson Leo Kok.The local unit of Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor Corp , the biggest car manufacturer in South Africa, says 98 percent of sales of its popular Fortuner SUV are diesel. Diesel cars are normally more efficient than their petrol-driven counterparts.Industry data shows two-thirds of passenger sales are now small vehicles, compared with 61 percent four years ago. Over that time, the smallest models have increased their market share to 25 percent from 16 percent.As well as pushing buyers towards smaller, more efficient cars, the weak currency should help domestic manufacturers as cheap Asian imports become more expensive and locally made products start to look more reasonable.“The weaker rand helps to make it more difficult for unfairly incentivised products coming in cheaply from the east to compete in our domestic market,�� said Coenraad Bezuidenhout of the Manufacturing Circle, a factory lobby group.South Africa’s purchasing managers�� index, a forward-looking gauge of sentiment among manufacturers, hit a six-year high in August, and in July manufacturing output surged to 5.4 percent year-on-year from 0.5 percent the previous month.At the same time, the share price of retailer Verimark has slumped as the cost of imported products such as its “Floorwiz�� mop and “Pentagon�� hair trimmer-cum-electric toothbrush has risen.In May, the group cited the weak rand as the main reason for a drop of more than two-thirds in its sales.“We may be seeing the first signs of import replacement as the weaker rand improves the competitiveness of locally manufactured goods versus more expensive imported goods,�� said Abdul Davids, head of research at Johannesburg-based Kagiso Asset Management.Although the deeply traded emerging market currency remains vulnerable to shifts in global portfolio flows as the U.S. gets ready to begin reining in its economic stimulus, standard economics suggests the rand should bounce back.With consumers avoiding expensive imported goods and with South African exports becoming more competitive, the balance of trade should recover, plugging a deficit in the current account, which grew to a hefty 6.5 percent of GDP in the second quarter.However, as with other emerging markets, the big question is when the current account will start to respond in earnest.“I firmly believe that the current account will narrow meaningfully in response to the weaker rand, although this will probably occur with a reasonably long delay of at least a year,�� said Elna Moolman of Macquarie Securities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. auto suppliers told Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer they are ready to restart production and raised alarm about new delays to resuming operations.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, most auto suppliers halted operations in late March as automakers closed their factories. Now uncertainty about when Michigan will allow the resumption of operations is causing delays throughout the U.S. auto industry.The Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association and Original Equipment Suppliers Association told Whitmer in a letter late on Thursday seen by Reuters that “delays in re-opening facilities would increase liquidity risk for suppliers and jeopardize long-term capital investment and employment for Michigan.”The group asked Whitmer “to provide clear authority for automotive suppliers to restart their operations in Michigan at least five days before OEM production begins.”Auto suppliers in Michigan employ about 125,000 people and are generally paid 45 days after production. Automotive industry executives say that means some smaller suppliers are in danger of running out of money in the coming weeks.Earlier this week, both Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T pushed back the planned resumption of U.S. auto production and cited auto supplier issues as a factor.Whitmer’s office did not immediately comment but she has held regular talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and top executives of Detroit’s Big Three automakers, officials say.U.S. automakers hope to begin production as early as May 18, which would mean auto suppliers would need the green light to resume operations on May 11. The letter said the “Michigan supplier community is ready to re-start and we are committed to working with your Administration to build public confidence in our ability to safely reopen our places of business.”The UAW said last week that it was “too soon and too risky�� to reopen auto plants in early May.The letter noted the dependence of U.S. auto production on Michigan-based suppliers.“Vehicle manufacturers throughout the country and the world depend on parts and components manufactured in Michigan. Because of this integration, Michigan suppliers are a vital link to the industry’s economic recovery,�� the letter said.It included a list of chief executives of auto suppliers and senior executives from the North American-units of foreign firms supporting the requests including Continental AG CONG.DE, BorgWarner BWA.N, American Axle AXL.N, Lear Corp LEA.N, Magna International MG.TO, Denso Corp 6902.T, Robert Bosch LLC, Nexteer Automotive 1316.HK and LG Electronics USA 066570.KS.	4.763877382

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday said it would reduce vehicle production in Japan by 122,000 units in June, as a lack of demand for new cars due to the coronavirus prompts the automaker to keep its plants running on limited operations.The drop in Toyota’s production underscores the challenging conditions for carmakers around the world due to the fallout from the virus. Besides weak demand, problems with procurement and social distancing measures at plants are also expected to hit output.The automaker said it would halt production at all of its 15 plants for four days next month, while stopping output for up to 7 days on 10 of its production lines, which make models including the Prius gasoline hybrid, Corolla sedan, and 4Runner SUV.In addition, it plans to operate only single shifts on five production lines next month, an arrangement which would continue on two lines through July, and through August on another, it said in a statement.A Toyota spokeswoman said the reduced output represented a 40% cut from initial plans made earlier in the year, while declining to give further details. In June 2019, it produced 289,544 vehicles at home.Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Toyota planned to slash production in North America by nearly a third through October due to the coronavirus The automaker resumed some output at its seven North American sites this week.Toyota is bracing for an 80% drop in full-year operating profit, its lowest in nine years, as it expect car sales to remain weak for much of the year.Some analysts believe industry-wide global auto sales could slump by a third this year and that any recovery will slow and patchy as job losses and reduced incomes weigh on consumer spending.	6.637649619

Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen aus der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus:TOYOTA - Tokio: Der japanische Autobauer plant wegen der Coronavirus-Krise seine heimische Produktion im Juni zu reduzieren. Wegen der geringeren Nachfrage nach Neuwagen werde der Konzern nun 122.000 Einheiten weniger herstellen, teilte Toyota mit. Dies entspreche einer 40-prozentigen Kürzung gegenüber den bisherigen Prognosen für den Monat Juni.BMW - München: Der Autobauer beginnt mit der angekündigten Herstellung von Atemschutzmasken in Deutschland. Zwei vollautomatische Anlagen produzieren im Werk Wackersdorf bei Regensburg täglich insgesamt bis zu 200.000 Mund-Nase-Masken, mit denen sich BMW-Mitarbeiter vor dem Coronavirus schützen sollen. Spezialmaschinen und Rohmaterial stammen ebenfalls aus Bayern. Die Maschinen lieferte der zum chinesischen Autozulieferer Ningbo Joyson Electronic gehörende deutsche Hersteller PIA Automation. Vliesstoffe kommen vom bayerischen Textilkonzern Sandler. Die Bundesregierung will die heimische Produktion von Masken und weiterer medizinischer Ausrüstung ankurbeln.OTTOBOCK �� Danzig: Das Medizintechnikunternehmen hat im vergangenen Jahr erstmals einen Jahresumsatz von mehr als einer Milliarde Euro erzielt. Der Umsatz kletterte 2019 um 8,2 Prozent auf 1,003 Milliarden Euro, wie Ottobock mitteilte. Der bereinigte operative Gewinn (Ebitda) stieg um zehn Prozent auf 191 Millionen Euro. Damit verbesserte sich die Ebitda-Marge auf 19,2 Prozent. “Im nächsten Schritt wollen wir ein Niveau von 20 Prozent erreichen��, sagte Finanzchef Jörg Wahlers. Für 2020 habe Ottobock das Wachstumstempo eigentlich steigern wollen, doch die Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise auf die Geschäftszahlen seien noch nicht abschätzbar, sagte Firmenchef Philipp Schulte-Noelle. “In den ersten Monaten waren wir voll auf Kurs, diese Ziele zu erreichen.�� Sobald sich die Situation normalisiert habe, rechne das Unternehmen mit Nachholeffekten.FOXCONN - Taipeh: Der Gewinn des taiwanischen Elektronikherstellers ist im ersten Quartal um fast 90 Prozent eingebrochen. Der Nettogewinn von Foxconn - früher Hon Hai Precision - rutschte auf 2,1 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar (rund 65 Millionen Euro), da die Corona-Pandemie die Nachfrage von Apple und anderen Großkunden drückte, wie Foxconn mitteilte. Dies liegt deutlich unter den Analystenschätzungen von 8,88 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar. Der Konzern erwartet jedoch ein zweistelliges Umsatzwachstum im zweiten Quartal, da die Produktion in China wieder hochgefahren ist. “Hon Hai wird sich im zweiten Quartal stabilisieren��, erklärte der Konzern.FORTUM/UNIPER - Helsinki: Der finnische Energieversorger Fortum hat im ersten Quartal weniger verdient. Der operative Gewinn schrumpfte um vier Prozent auf 393 Millionen Euro, lag damit aber noch über den Erwartungen der Analysten. Der Mehrheitseigentümer des Düsseldorfer Versorgers Uniper konnte Einbußen durch niedrigere Strompreise weitgehend durch Absicherungsgeschäfte ausgleichen. Fortum bekräftigte, im Laufe des Jahres mit Uniper eine gemeinsame Strategie zu entwickeln.WÜSTENROT &amp; WÜRTTEMBERGISCHE (W&amp;W) - München: Der Gewinn des Bauspar- und Versicherungskonzerns ist wegen des Abschwungs an den Kapitalmärkten in der Coronakrise im ersten Quartal um zwei Drittel eingebrochen. Das Nettoergebnis sei auf 25,0 (78,5) Millionen Euro gesunken, teilte W&amp;W mit. Grund dafür war ein negatives Finanzergebnis. Die Pandemie zeigte sich vor allem bei der Bausparkasse Wüstenrot, deren Brutto-Neugeschäft um 13 Prozent einbrach. Damit habe sie aber noch Marktanteile gewonnen, erklärte W&amp;W. Die Gewinnprognose für 2020 hatte der Konzern bereits Anfang Mai gekappt.CATHAY PACIFIC - Sydney: Die Fluggesellschaft bezeichnet ihre Aussichten wegen der Coronavirus-Pandemie als “sehr düster��. Die Passagierzahlen von Cathay Pacific brachen im April um 99,6 Prozent ein. “Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt sehen wir noch keine unmittelbaren Anzeichen für eine Verbesserung��, sagte Ronald Lam, Manager bei Cathay Pacific. Das Hongkonger Unternehmen verbuchte im Zeitraum Januar bis April einen ungeprüften Verlust von 4,5 Milliarden Hongkong-Dollar (537,1 Millionen Euro).GEA - Düsseldorf: Der für die Nahrungsmittel- und Getränkeindustrie produzierende Anlagenbauer hat bislang keine größeren Auswirkungen der Coronakrise zu spüren bekommen. So stieg der Auftragseingang um 16 Prozent auf 1,38 Milliarden Euro und markierte damit eine Bestmarke für ein erstes Quartal. Bei einem Umsatzplus um 3,5 Prozent auf 1,09 Milliarden Euro stieg das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) vor Restrukturierungsaufwand um 40,7 Prozent auf 105 Millionen Euro. “Gea ist sehr gut in das Geschäftsjahr 2020 gestartet. Auch wenn die Dauer und damit die finanziellen Auswirkungen von Covid-19 nur schwer abzuschätzen sind, halten wir an unserem Ausblick für 2020 fest��, betonte Vorstandschef Stefan Klebert.AURUBIS - Düsseldorf: Der Kupferkonzern ist dank gestiegener Preise im ersten Halbjahr des Bilanzjahres 2019/20 trotz der Coronakrise noch glimpflich davon gekommen. Bei einem Umsatzanstieg auf 6,013 (Vorjahr: 5,7) Milliarden Euro schrumpfte das Vorsteuerergebnnis auf 91 (103) Millionen Euro. “Angesichts der Covid-19-Pandemie haben wir Aurubis bisher gut durch die Krise gesteuert��, erklärte Vorstandschef Roland Harings. Er bekräftigte daher seine Jahresziele.VARTA - Düsseldorf: Wegen der hohen Nachfrage nach Lithium-Ionen-Zellen und dank eines Zukaufs ist der schwäbische Batteriehersteller mit deutlichen Zuwächsen ins Jahr gestartet. Der Umsatz schnellte um rund 170 Prozent auf 198,5 Milionen Euro, ohne Akquisitionen hätte der Zuwachs bei 68,2 Prozent gelegen. Das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) stieg in den ersten drei Monaten um 197 Prozent auf 51,7 Millionen Euro, bereinigt um 135 Prozent. Der Vorstand bekräftigte seine Prognose für 2020, die einen Umsatz zwischen 780 und 800 Mio. Millionen Euro vorsieht, ein Wachstum zwischen 115 und 120 Prozent.OFFICE DEPOT - Bangalore: Der US-Büroartikelhersteller kündigt die Streichung von rund 13.100 Arbeitsplätzen und die Schließung von Filialen an. Die Maßnahmen sollen bis Ende 2023 umgesetzt werden und zu Nettoeinsparungen von 860 Millionen Dollar führen, wie das Management bekanntgab. Zugleich werden durch den Abbau Belastungen von bis zu 543 Millionen Dollar erwartet. Office Depot will sich künftig stärker auf sein Geschäft mit IT-Dienstleistungen konzentrieren.OMV - Wien: Beim Wiener Erdöl- und Gaskonzern werden die Reiseausgaben von Vorstandschef Rainer Seele und die Sponsoring-Aktivitäten des Unternehmens unter die Lupe genommen. Eine entsprechende Prüfung ordnete der Aufsichtsrat an, wie dessen Vorsitzender Wolfgang Berndt mitteilte. Hintergrund ist ein Bericht der Onlineplattform dossier.at. Diesem zufolge zahlte OMV für Seeles Nutzung von Privatflugzeugen seit 2016 insgesamt 400.000 Euro. Die Sponsorenvereinbarung mit dem Fußballclub Zenit St. Petersburg, dem angeblichen Lieblingsteam des russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin, habe 25 Millionen Euro gekostet. Aufsichtsratschef Berndt sagte der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters, Seeles und seine eigenen Reiseausgaben von 2017 bis 2019 würden untersucht. Das gelte auch für alle Sponsoringausgaben.NIKE - Bangalore: Der US-Sportartikelhersteller erwartet eine Belastung der Finanzergebnisse im laufenden Geschäftsquartal durch die coronabedingten Filialschließungen rund um den Globus. Das teilte der Adidas- und Puma-Konkurrent am Donnerstag nach US-Börsenschluss mit. Nike fährt zwar sein E-Commerce-Geschäft hoch, um die gestiegenen Internetbestellungen stemmen zu können. Aber je nach Land sind nach Angaben des Managements derzeit nur fünf bis 40 Prozent der Nike-Filialen offen. In mehr als 15 Ländern hat das Unternehmen nach den Schließungen im Zuge der Viruskrise wieder Geschäfte geöffnet, darunter Deutschland, Frankreich, Brasilien und die USA.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Fuel-cell technology is becoming cheaper and will be commercially viable for mass use in cars by 2025, a senior executive at auto industry supplier Robert Bosch said on Friday.Non-polluting fuel-cell cars have failed to gain widespread acceptance because of prohibitive development costs, even though they can run five times longer than electric cars and take far less time to refuel.By 2025 fuel cell production will be more industrialized, bringing down costs thanks to greater economies of scale, Wolf-Henning Scheider, head of Bosch’s automotive division, told an industry conference in Berlin.“They are not out of the race. They are a viable alternative to other zero-emission vehicle technologies,�� Scheider told Reuters.Though Scheider said that fuel-cell powertrains are still likely to be twice as expensive to produce than those for electric cars in 2025, he expects the higher operating range of fuel-cell cars to make them a viable alternative.Daimler, Hyundai, Nissan, Ford, Toyota, Honda and General Motors are all developing fuel-cell vehicles.Toyota and Honda plan to start selling fuel-cell vehicles next year.Fuel-cell technology combines hydrogen with oxygen in the air to generate electricity. The only emissions are water vapor and heat, but the technology has been held back by high costs and lack of infrastructure.The first fuel-cell cars on the market are expected to be priced at about $70,000, but analysts say that does not cover manufacturers�� development costs, nor the expense of building filling stations at more than $1 million each.Electric cars are far less expensive and can be charged at home, work or on the road, but they can travel only 100-200km (62-124 miles) on a single charge.	2.495994603
Nemanja Bjelica drilled a 3-pointer at the buzzer and the Sacramento Kings claimed a 119-118 victory over the host Houston Rockets on Monday at Toyota Center.Bjelica drilled a 33-footer off an inbound pass from Cory Joseph to answer a driving layup from Rockets guard Russell Westbrook on the preceding possession. Bjelica scored over PJ Tucker to cap his 17-point performance and the Kings finished 20 of 45 from behind the arc to win two of three legs of the Texas triangle. They lost 105-104 in overtime at San Antonio on Friday before winning 110-106 at Dallas on Sunday.Westbrook scored a season-high 34 points, primarily on driving layups as the Kings offered scant rim protection. His basket countered a game-tying 3 from Kings guard Buddy Hield (team-high 26 points), whose trey matched a 3 from Ben McLemore with 22.7 seconds left.The Rockets had won 18 of 20 meetings against the Kings, who received 19 points and eight rebounds from Harrison Barnes and 16 points plus eight rebounds from Richaun Holmes. Joseph added 14 points and six assists.James Harden paired 27 points with 10 assists for the Rockets while Tucker grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds to go with 10 points. Clint Capela also had a double-double with 13 points and 17 rebounds.Early energy enabled the Kings to recover from a wobbly start. Scoreless over the opening two-plus minutes, Sacramento darted to an 18-10 lead courtesy of four 3s from four different players: Bjelica, Barnes, Hield and Joseph. When Trevor Ariza added back-to-back 3s off the Sacramento bench late in the first quarter, the Kings led 32-23 and it wasn’t until several minutes into the second quarter that the Rockets managed a response.Gary Clark provided Houston a boost off the bench with 11 points in six minutes across the first two quarters. A temporary answer discovered, the Rockets finished 8 for 19 from behind the arc in the second quarter and led 54-43 when Harden completed a three-point play with 4:56 remaining in the first half.But the Kings offered a reply with four consecutive 3s, two from Joseph, and Houston needed 3-pointers from Westbrook and McLemore down the stretch to carry a 64-59 lead into the break.--Field Level Media	-0.474571469
PRAGUE, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Czech manufacturers are set to produce a record 1.4 million vehicles in 2017, about 50,000 more than in 2016, CTK news agency reported on Thursday, citing the country’s Automotive Industry Association.Production of all vehicle categories rose 4.5 percent to 1.314 million in the January-November period, with passenger car production reaching 1.307 million in that period, CTK reported.Of the country’s three car plants, Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto produced the largest share. Hyundai Motor Co and a joint venture of Toyota Motor Corp and Peugeot are the other manufacturers.	10.96187872
TOKYO (Reuters) - British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt reassured Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday that the British government was determined to avoid a no-deal exit from the European Union.“We recognise that Japan has many investments employing hundreds of thousands of people in the U.K. We want strong cooperation to continue,�� Hunt told Abe at the Japanese leader’s residence in Tokyo.Japan is one of Britain’s biggest foreign investors, building cars and other products in a country it has viewed as a gateway to the broader European market.Britain’s decision to leave the EU has raised concern in London that Japanese firms will shift operations elsewhere if tariff-free trade ends with the rest of the European bloc.Hunt is also visiting Toyota Motor Corp, which plans to build a new car model with Suzuki in Britain, during his trip to Japan.	-1.090432073
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is recalling 33,000 cars, pickup trucks and commercial vehicles worldwide to replace a defective part that may cause engine failure.Most of the recalled models are in Japan, Toyota spokesman John Hanson said. About 4,000 four-cylinder Tacoma pickup trucks will be recalled in the United States.The vehicles, which were all built this year, have engine valve springs that may develop cracks and break over time. This could lead to noisy, rough engine performance and, in some cases, the engine could stop while the vehicle is in motion.The problem arose because the equipment used to make the part was not properly maintained, Toyota said in a press release. The engine valve spring was built by Japanese company Chuo Spring Co Ltd, Hanson said.Other models affected by Toyota’s global recall include the Land Cruiser Prado mid-size SUV and several larger vehicles.	-3.878464317
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N C-Max and Fusion hybrids fell about 20 percent short of its fuel economy claims, Consumer Reports magazine said after running tests on both models.The influential magazine said the Fusion hybrid delivered 39 miles per gallon both on the highway and in city driving, while the C-Max hit a combined 37 miles per gallon. Both models were expected to achieve about 47 miles per gallon, according to estimates from Ford and the Environmental Protection Agency.“These two vehicles have the largest discrepancy between our overall-mpg results and the estimates published by the EPA that we’ve seen among any current models,�� Consumer Reports said in a blog post on its website.Improving the fuel efficiency of its lineup has been a pillar of Ford’s strategy for the past six years. The No. 2 U.S. automaker expects to wind up with 11 percent of the U.S. market for electrified vehicles this year.Ford must also meet the U.S. government’s target for corporate average fuel economy of 54.5 mpg by 2025, which translates to 36 mpg or higher in real world driving.Driving aggressively and other factors can undercut the fuel economy estimated by the EPA. In a statement, Ford said C-Max and Fusion hybrid drivers reported a range of fuel economy figures, including some that surpassed 47 miles per gallon.“This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions and other factors can cause mileage to vary,�� Ford spokesman Wes Sherwood said.Consumer Reports said among current models, more than 80 percent of the vehicles it tested were within two miles per gallon of the estimates. The Fusion hybrid fell short by 8 miles per gallon, while the C-Max was off by 10 miles per gallon.The Fusion hybrid still has the best fuel economy of any family sedan tested by Consumer Reports. The C-Max hybrid is second behind Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Prius V.“Make no mistake; both the Fusion Hybrid and C-Max Hybrid still deliver excellent fuel economy,�� Consumer Reports said. “But our tests show that buyers shouldn’t expect the stellar 47 mpg that Ford is promoting.”The review comes a little more than a month after an EPA investigation showed that Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and its affiliate, Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS, had overstated their fuel economy by at least a mile per gallon.Last week, the Fusion won the coveted Green Car of the Year award at the Los Angeles Auto Show.The Fusion, which competes in the bread-and-butter midsize sedan segment of the market, is a particularly important model for Ford. Earlier this year, Ford passed out T-shirts imprinted with the Fusion hybrid’s fuel economy figures at an event in New York with Chief Executive Alan Mulally to promote the Fusion.Also on Thursday, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy released their 2013 fuel economy guide, which includes sections on alternate-energy vehicles. The guide includes sections on electric vehicles, hybrids and plug-in hybrids.The Fusion and C-Max hybrids are listed as getting 47 miles per gallon in the report. The models are the second-best in their class after the 2013 Toyota Prius and Prius c.There are more than 40 hybrid cars, trucks and SUVs in the 2013 guide, which includes 14 electric vehicles, such as top-rated Toyota’s 2013 Scion iQ EV, from 10 manufacturers. The Scion iQ EV gets the equivalent of 121 miles per gallon.Three plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are rated. Ford’s C-Max Energi tops the list with an EPA rating of 100 MPGe.	10.95238095
(Adds details, automated driving background)TOKYO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to first deploy advanced self-driving features in commercial vehicles before adding them to cars meant for personal use, a senior official at the Japanese auto major said on Tuesday.It will be easier to apply self-driving technology that does not require constant and direct human-monitoring to taxis and vehicles Toyota is developing, including on-demand ride services, mobile shops and ambulatory hospitals, said James Kuffner, chief of Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development (TRI-AD).The operators of these vehicles could control when and where they are deployed and oversee their maintenance, he told reporters at the opening of its new offices in Tokyo.“It will take more time to achieve ‘Level 4�� for a personally-owned vehicle,�� Kuffner said, referring to the automation level at which vehicles can drive themselves under limited conditions.“Level 4 is really what we’re striving for to first appear in mobility as a service,�� he added.Toyota is set to release its first so-called ‘Level 2�� autonomous car capable of driving itself on the highway, as part of its strategy to develop self-driving cars over the next few decades.Toyota and its suppliers, including Denso Corp, which also invests in TRI-AD, is adopting a longer view toward cars with self-driving technology and artificial intelligence (AI) than many competitors that already market vehicles capable of autonomous highway driving.Many of Toyota’s rivals, however, have pared development targets after fatal accidents in Tesla Inc cars have shown the complexity of autonomous technology even as they need to clear high regulation hurdles.

BEIJING, April 24 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co is proving that being late to the party in China doesn’t have to be a handicap, and is poised to widen its lead among Japanese automakers in the world’s biggest car market with speedy and aggressive expansion plans.Despite being among the last global automakers to enter the Chinese market, Nissan outsold Toyota Motor Corp to become the top Japanese light-vehicle brand there last year for the first time, according to research firm LMC Automotive.Aiding Nissan’s climb have been its cooperative partnership with state-owned Dongfeng Motor Group in the heavily regulated market.It is also benefitting from an early foray into the booming inland regions and a full product line-up ranging from premium Infiniti-brand cars to light commercial vehicles and compacts such as the popular Tiida model.After a bumper 2011, Nissan’s local joint venture, Dongfeng Motor Co, was the fastest-growing automaker in China in the first quarter of 2012, growing 16 percent in a market that fell 0.3 percent from the year before.In another step to accelerate its growth, Nissan this week unveiled at the Beijing auto show the first production model under its joint venture’s own, entry-level Venucia brand, following China’s directive for all foreign car makers to form a separate brand with their local partners to help the country’s fledgling industry gain technological know-how.“We want to be a global car maker, presenting every single kind of product you can find in the Nissan brand - from the luxury, with Infiniti, and the entry level with affordable cars under Venucia,�� Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told Reuters TV at the show. “We’re going to be everywhere.”Dongfeng Nissan, the joint venture’s passenger car arm, said it aims to add a new Venucia model every year, targeting annual sales of 300,000 vehicles by 2015, with five products and 250 exclusive dealers.In another move that promises to nudge Nissan further ahead of Toyota and Honda Motor Co, Japan’s No.2 automaker said last week it would begin producing Infiniti vehicles in China from 2014, putting it on a more level playing field with dominant German brands that build locally and avoid import tariffs of 25 percent. Toyota and Honda executives have said they have no immediate plans to produce their Lexus and Acura premium vehicles in China.“Nissan’s management has been unsparing and speedy in its investments in emerging markets, particularly China,�� said Kenji Yoshida, a partner at consultancy PwC. “That’s definitely helping them.”All the while, Toyota and Honda have seen their market share slip in the past four years as competition intensifies in the mid-sized sedan segment where their core Camry and Accord models had driven sales. Honda’s sales in China fell for the first time in 2011, although part of that was due to a supply shortage resulting from Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March.Toyota and Honda also missed the trend towards affordable compact cars as consumers sought better fuel economy. Gasoline prices in China have soared about 60 percent over the last three years, to more than 8 yuan ($1.27) per litre.Both automakers are looking to fight back.“We were a bit thin in the compact segment,�� Honda CEO Takanobu Ito conceded. “Our first priority is to add more compact models and increase our sales volumes,�� he told reporters in Beijing. Honda on Monday announced plans for a new factory that would boost its output capacity in China by roughly a third to 1.01 million cars a year by 2014.Toyota, for its part, unveiled a design-oriented compact concept model, called the “Toyota Qin��, aimed at attracting young buyers. It has said it aims to roughly double its Chinese sales to 1.6-1.8 million vehicles by 2015.Nissan, meanwhile, is aiming to boost its annual output capacity in China by two-thirds to 2 million vehicles by the end of 2015, and its market share to 10 percent from 7.4 percent.Like Honda, Toyota acknowledged that its recent growth in China has been wanting, especially considering its top-three standing in global sales.“In the United States and Japan, we are very successful, but we are only number five (among foreign car makers) in China,�� said Dong Changzheng, a top executive at Toyota’s Chinese subsidiary.“At the same time, we’re not targeting an expansion in sales volumes as much as a leadership position in vehicle technology,�� he told reporters on Tuesday.Under a new local marketing campaign that started last month, Toyota has been promoting the advantages of hybrid technology, in which it has a big lead globally but which has failed to catch on in China due to its hefty price premium over conventional gasoline cars. At the auto show, Toyota also debuted a China-only hybrid concept car, called “Yundong Shuangqing��, that will be sold from 2015 with a hybrid system developed primarily at its new Chinese R&amp;D centre.“Gasoline prices are rising so the real cost of hybrid cars for the customer should come down,�� Dong said, adding that localising hybrid parts should also lower production costs. “We want to help spread hybrids over the next three years.”Toyota said it would also launch a plug-in hybrid car in China this year, moving the plan forward by one year.Nissan’s Ghosn argued, however, that conventional hybrids were at a disadvantage after the Chinese government last week set a target of putting 5 million plug-in hybrids and pure-electric vehicles on the road between now and 2020.The government says it will provide generous subsidies for those cars as long as they use batteries procured locally. Under the policy, foreign battery makers will only be able to manufacture in a minority-held joint venture, raising concerns over technology transfer.Nissan, which has made zero-emission leadership a major pillar of its global strategy, has committed to building electric cars in China by 2015, under the Venucia brand. Ghosn said Nissan and its French partner, Renault SA, were prepared to follow any guideline put forward by Beijing.“I think Nissan’s run will continue,�� said Credit Suisse auto analyst Kunihiko Shiohara, noting that success in China hinged not just on product-competitiveness but factors such as good relations with the government. “In that respect, Nissan seems much more committed and is in a better position.��	-5.604719764
June 19 (Reuters) - Porsche won the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race for the second year in a row on Sunday after Toyota had a first victory snatched agonisingly from their grasp by a last lap power failure.Japanese driver Kazuki Nakajima had been on course to take the chequered flag when he reported a problem before slowing with less than five minutes remaining.That handed the victory to the number two Porsche shared by Switzerland’s Neel Jani, Frenchman Roland Dumas and Germany’s Marc Lieb.The 84th edition of the race was watched by a crowd of 263,500 spectators.

* Exporters sold as earnings disappoint* SoftBank Group adds hefty positive points to Nikkei* Mazda soars after raising forecastTOKYO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell on concerns about slowing corporate earnings growth, though SoftBank Group allayed some of the anxiety as its shares jumped after the index-heavy firm announced a share buyback and above-expected third-quarter profits.The Nikkei share average dropped 0.7 percent to 20,729.32 in midmorning trade.The broader Topix declined 1 percent to 1,566.70, with all but one of its 33 subsectors in the red.Exporter stocks were sold off, with Panasonic Corp falling 3.3 percent, Toyota Motor Corp shedding 2.6 percent and Suzuki Motor declining 3.6 percent.“Many of the Japanese and U.S. companies have cut their earnings forecasts during this earnings season so investors find it difficult to buy,�� said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, referring to bellwether companies such as Toyota, Hitachi Ltd and Panasonic.In the United States, disappointing revenue forecasts from videogame companies pulled down the overall market overnight.Going against the grain, SoftBank Group Corp shares jumped more than 17 percent to a level not seen since mid-October after Chief Executive Masayoshi Son unveiled a $5.5 billion share buyback to prop up its share price, which he sees as undervalued.SoftBank contributed a hefty 156 points to the Nikkei.Analysts said the big share buyback announcement was the icing on top of SoftBank’s robust earnings.Buoyed by rising valuations of its technology investments, SoftBank Group’s operating profit in the October-December quarter rose to 438.3 billion yen from 274 billion yen a year earlier. That handily beat the 225 billion yen average estimate of three analysts polled by Refinitiv which gives a higher weighting to top-rated analysts.Bucking the weak market, Mazda Motor Corp also surged 8.4 percent after the automaker forecast a full-year operating profit of 80 billion yen, up from a previous forecast of 70 billion yen.	0.8636017272
* Over 500,000 cars recalled overseas since April* Size of recalls pale in comparison to Toyota, Hyundai* Recalls coincide with VW’s global expansion pushBERLIN, June 12 (Reuters) - The growing number of overseas recalls afflicting Germany’s Volkswagen shows the perils of rushing for volume as Europe’s largest automaker is vying for the world’s top spot.VW, which sells 60 percent of vehicles outside its core European market, said on Wednesday it will pull 26,000 cars off the roads in Australia, the third straight month VW has had to recall models after similar steps in China, Singapore and Japan.Over half a million autos, including VW’s best-selling Golf hatchback and the popular Passat model, are affected as VW aims to fix long-standing problems with seven-speed direct-shift (DSG) gearboxes.While the actions pale in comparison to the 7.4 million autos Toyota recalled last October over faulty power window switches or the 1.8 million cars Hyundai Motor Corp and its Kia Motors affiliate took off U.S. roads in April, they coincide with a drastic phase in VW’s global expansion.The Wolfsburg-based group is rolling out a cost-saving engineering platform at factories around the world, is tailoring more cars to specific regions and adding seven more plants in China, VW’s biggest market where its two joint ventures will spend almost 10 billion euros ($13.34 billion) through 2015 on plants, products and equipment.“Manufacturers definitely become more vulnerable (to recalls) the more they’re pushing global expansion and stretch supplier networks,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne, Germany.VW’s modular platforms, allowing for a greater proportion of parts to be shared among different brands and models, help as the company sets out to become the world’s top automaker by 2018.Yet, they also make VW more vulnerable if one part turns out to be flawed.VW on Wednesday disclosed few reasons for the latest gearbox problems, saying “an electronic malfunction�� inside the transmission’s control unit may cause loss of power.Analysts have said that VW’s problems in China and Japan were due to the hot and wet climate in parts of these countries, the extreme stop-and-go traffic as well as pollution typical of some Asian cities.Christoph Stuermer, Frankfurt-based analyst with IHS Automotive said VW’s gearbox problems arise as the German group is targeting economies of scale by using technology in abundance to offset high development costs.“These could be effects of an overly centralised strategy,�� Stuermer said.VW Group is “arguably�� in danger of becoming too big for its own good, Morgan Stanley auto analyst Stuart Pearson told the Automotive News Congress in Paris on Wednesday.“We’ve seen what can go wrong with GM in the past,�� Pearson said. “They probably have five or 10 years ahead of them rolling out their new modular platform, gaining more share and making more money ... but eventually it will become an issue.��	10.44470949
* European car registrations down 10 pct in Nov* Market weakness showing “no signs of abating�� - analyst* Jan-Nov registrations down 7.2 pct to 11.69 million cars* BMW, Daimler, Toyota, VW gain market share, others loseBy Laurence Frost and Andreas CremerPARIS/BERLIN, Dec 14 (Reuters) - France’s PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault led a 10 percent decline in European car sales in November, the market’s first double-digit contraction in more than two years as economic gloom spread east and north.The French suffered most - closely followed by General Motors and Fiat - as demand weakened sharply at home, in Germany and in eastern Europe, according to data published on Friday by the Association of European Carmakers.Total European registrations fell to 965,918 cars for the month and 11.69 million for January-November, down 7.2 percent on the same period last year.“European end market weakness is showing no signs of abating,�� London-based Credit Suisse analyst David Arnold wrote in a note published on Friday.With December a seasonally weak sales month, Europe appears on course to record a similar drop for the year as a whole, to about 12.2 million total sales - its lowest in close to two decades. Most commentators now expect 2013 volumes to decline further, according to Arnold.“Tough times clearly still lie ahead for Europe’s mass-market car players,�� the Credit Suisse analyst said.Paris-based Peugeot, scrapping more than 10,000 jobs and a car plant to stem losses, suffered a 16 percent regional sales slide as its home market shrank 19 percent.Renault’s November registrations plunged 27 percent as the spreading economic weakness hurt sales of its no-frills Dacia brand, which until recently had resisted the worst of the slump.Ripple effects are still being felt from the collapse of austerity-hit Mediterranean auto markets last year.The downtrend didn’t even spare Germany where year-to-date registrations have held broadly stable at just below 2.9 million vehicles. The drop in new auto sales in Europe’s biggest market deepened to 3.5 percent in November after a 0.5 percent dip in October.“Orders have weakened considerably,�� said Ernst-Robert Nouvertne, who runs two VW dealerships near Germany’s city of Cologne. “No one knows yet how much the debt crisis is going to cost us in the end. But our tax-paying customers will have to pay the piper. That’s bad for our business.”Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest automaker, posted a 2.5 percent sales drop led by the core VW brand, though has raised its market share to almost a quarter this year from 23.3 percent in 2011.German rivals BMW and Daimler and Japan’s Toyota have also expanded their footprint in the embattled European region while the market share of Peugeot, Renault, Ford and Fiat dropped, according to ACEA.The sales decline also worsened in eastern Europe - from 2.2 percent to 6.7 percent in Poland and from 7.4 percent to 11 percent in the Czech Republic.GM and Fiat both tumbled 13 percent across Europe, while Ford paced the market’s 10 percent fall.The last time European auto sales fell 10 percent or more was in October 2010, when the market recorded a 16 percent year-on-year contraction to 1.06 million cars.	11.79119991
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average is expected to come under pressure on Tuesday as the yen’s gains against the dollar during a market holiday the previous day raise concerns over exporters.A surprise decline in U.S. June retail sales provided the latest evidence of a slowing U.S. economy, boosting speculation of stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve and undermining the dollar.That lifted the yen to a one-month high of 78.688 per dollar on Monday.“Looking at the yen’s moves, I feel that the market will still be in a correction phase and could turn negative,�� said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.Market players said the Nikkei was likely to trade between 8,650 to 8,800 on Tuesday.Nikkei futures in Chicago closed at 8,735 on Monday, up from Friday’s close in Osaka of 8,700.

JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Reuters) - The South African unit of Toyota could see its production drop by around 15-20% in 2020, its president and CEO Andrew Kirby said on Wednesday.The division had already lost production of around 13,500 units due to a nationwide lockdown in South Africa, set to last five weeks, Kirby told a virtual media briefing.Its annual production volume normally stands at around 135,000-150,000 units.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota has begun slashing costs, starting with sales and marketing, and shifting resources into research that will help it keep up with new competitors, four people familiar with the matter said.One of the company’s first moves was to cancel contracts with the China unit of its long-term communication and advertising agency, Dentsu Inc, the sources said.Chief executive Akio Toyoda and chief financial and risk officer Koji Kobayashi want to follow the example of Tesla, Google and Tencent - all of which rely heavily on cheaper, often more innovative non-traditional marketing.They say the savings should be plowed into investment in emerging technology such as autonomous vehicles.“We may be posting record profits, but we don’t think we are keeping up with their pace of investments,�� one of the sources, a senior Toyota official, told Reuters.To do that, Kobayashi wants to tap into money once earmarked for automotive marketing and general expenses, which for the year that ended in March totaled 2.72 trillion yen ($24.66 billion).The company reported 2.4 trillion yen ($21.68 billion) in operating income in the same period, making Toyota one of the world’s most profitable automakers.The company’s profit margin is about 9 percent. But companies like Google and Apple - now competing directly with Toyota in automotive technology - boast numbers several times larger.Toyoda and Kobayashi see a sharp contrast between Toyota’s hyper-efficient factory side and its more wasteful sales operation, the sources said.Barring Beijing Dentsu from new business with the automaker next year, and scaling back work already approved, shows the effort to cut spending is serious, the sources said.Although the company may bid for Toyota contracts again in 2020, it will be a hard sell, they said. Beijing Dentsu had been doing about $50 million worth of business for Toyota annually.None of the four wished to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media about the issue.Toyota was frustrated with the cost of at least two events Dentsu organized in China: a ride-and-drive for Toyota’s premium Lexus brand in March and the Beijing auto show display stand for Toyota in April.A review by the automaker showed “out-of-control extravagance in how it executed those events - not over-billing,�� another one of the sources said. Beijing Dentsu declined to comment.It was not the first time Toyota had clashed with Dentsu; in 2016, the marketing company admitted to billing for services it did not perform.‘MARUNAGE’Toyota’s cost-cutting effort takes aim at wholesale outsourcing, known in Japan as “marunage,�� according to two of the sources. It can encompass items such as media buys, promotional events, and consumer and market research.The sources added that Toyoda and Kobayashi see marunage as flab weighing on the efficiency of Toyota’s non-factory operations, and hurting the company’s ability to research and produce better vehicles.At Toyota factories, engineers make a point of knowing everything they can about each component and process, all the way down to what each part costs. Even if they outsource production, they would produce it on their own first to understand its cost structure, the sources said.Toyoda and Kobayashi want to instil more discipline in Toyota’s sales and marketing teams, and to move in-house some of the jobs routinely outsourced today, the four sources said.That, the executives hope, will help give the company more financial firepower to keep up with Silicon Valley, which is pouring money into future automotive technology.For instance, a lawsuit Waymo filed against Uber over trade secrets revealed that Google’s parent company, Alphabet, spent $1.1 billion developing self-driving tech from 2009 to 2015. That’s about what Toyota set aside to fund a research institute it launched in 2016.On June 13, Toyota invested $1 billion in the Southeast Asian ride-hailing app Grab, giving it access to trip data that could help it develop next-generation services.Other established automakers are also taking steps to reshape their marketing operations. Ford has tried to “drive greater marketing efficiency�� by using new tools and technology rather than investing in traditional methods, the company said in a response to questions. The effort, however, doesn’t include Ford’s China unit or Lincoln brand.Toyota’s current cost-cutting drive began in January, propelled by Kobayashi.Kobayashi and Toyoda focused first on Beijing Dentsu in part because of the outsized Lexus event in March in the southern China city of Shenzhen, which Toyoda attended, the sources said. Both men declined to be interviewed for this story.What infuriated Toyoda and Kobayashi most, according the four sources, was what they described as the unnecessary extravagance of the event.Toyota in late March then began a last-minute cost-cutting effort on the display Dentsu had designed for the Beijing auto show in April.At a visit to the display during the event, it was clear where expenses had been trimmed: some rooms did not have ceilings, and downgraded VIP areas originally outfitted with upscale tables and seating now had steel-pipe chairs and other simple furniture.Generally, a stand such as the one Dentsu assembled would cost one billion yen ($10 million) or more. Toyota was only able to slightly reduce that cost.“Why spend this much money when we use an auto show stand once?�� said one of the knowledgeable individuals. “It’s this kind of out-of-control expense we had rein in.��	-0.7010402533
(Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE has applied to set up its first plant in Thailand to help narrow the gap with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Bloomberg reported late Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter.The manufacturer is seeking to participate in a government program offering tax exemptions for automakers investing at least 6.5 billion Thai baht ($200 million) in local manufacturing, the media service ,was pending.Carmakers had until March 31 to apply for the program which includes vehicle assembly, components and engine production, according to a ministry statement from October.People told Bloomberg that Volkswagen has not made a final decision on producing vehicles in Thailand as the exact terms and conditions may still change.Volkswagen could not be reached for a comment outside of normal business hours.Volkswagen sees a “strong market opportunity�� in southeast Asia, Hans Dieter Poetsch, chief financial officer of the multinational automaker said in a presentation published on the company’s website last week.	-3.094146685

(Add exec comments, details on mileage)SEOUL, Jan 7 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hyundai Motor on Thursday unveiled its first dedicated gasoline-electric vehicle, becoming one of a handful of automakers to challenge Toyota Motor’s Prius as low oil prices weigh on demand for fuel-efficient vehicles.Hyundai Motor Senior Vice President Lee Ki-sang said automakers had no choice but to boost green car sales to meet stringent emissions regulations, despite slackening demand as low petrol prices spur the market for gas-guzzling vehicles.“Oil prices could reduce hybrid car sales. But this is the way we have to go,�� Lee told reporters.Hyundai said the compact car, named the IONIQ, achieved fuel economy of 22.4 kms per litre, or 52.7 miles per gallon, in Korea. It would be rolled out in mid-January in its home market at a starting price of about 22.9 million won ($19,145).The latest Prius has not been launched in Korea, but Lee said the IONIQ would beat it for fuel economy in the United States and South Korea.Gasoline-hybrid car market leader Toyota last month trimmed its global sales target for the new Prius to 300,000-350,000 as lower petrol prices hurt demand.Hyundai has so far launched hybrid variants of their existing models like the Sonata and the Azera, but the 1.6-litre IONIQ is the first hybrid-exclusive car it has made from scratch.It is also the first car to offer three electrified versions, including plug-in hybrid and full-electric. Hyundai plans to introduce a plug-in hybrid version late this year after rolling out a pure electric version.Affiliate Kia Motors also plans to launch its first hybrid-dedicated model this year.

The index dipped below its 200-day moving average of 18,987, the first time since Oct. 2014.All of the broader Topix ��s 33 subsectors were in negative territory, while the Topix index fell as much as 3.5 percent to 1,518.15, dropping more than 10 percent from an eight-year peak of 1,702.83 hit on August 11.The China growth scare drove Wall Street to its steepest one-day drop in nearly four years on Friday, while the safe-haven yen rallied to a six-week peak against the dollar.“Investors were spooked by last week’s Wall Street’s fall and braced for the damage to the Japanese market at the market open,�� said Takuya Takahashi, an analyst at Daiwa Securities.Early on Monday, Chinese share markets tumbled in an ominous sign equity markets for the rest of the day.Global cyclical stocks led the declines, with the transport equipment sector tumbling 4.2 percent and the electric appliance sector falling 2.6 percent. Toyota dived 4.6 percent, Honda Motor Co shed 4.2 percent, Panasonic Corp declined 2.6 percent and Hitachi fell 3.6 percent.Financials were also battered after investors grew increasingly risk-averse, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropping 4.3 percent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group shedding 5.0 percent and Nomura Holdings falling 4.4 percent.Some traders said at below 19,000, the Nikkei presented buying opportunities.“While some investors seem to have been prepared for a worst-case scenario, which is a further market fall, I think the current market level suggests attractive buying opportunities,�� said Toru Ibayashi, executive director at UBS Wealth Management, adding that the Nikkei is expected to climb back to 20,000 once the panic sell-off has run its course.“We also believe central banks (of China, the U.S. and Japan) stand ready to provide support if sentiment worsens further, so the market is likely to recover eventually,�� Ibayashi said.Although there are worries about an expected rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this year, he said that the Fed can respond to any heightened market uncertainty by delaying the start of monetary tightening, which could ease investor worries.The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 dropped 2.8 percent to 13,777.33.	3.514799154

* President Pena Nieto to attend announcement on Wed- sources* Plant to be benchmark for improving efficiency in region- source* Site would be Toyota’s first passenger car plant in Mexico (Adds details, background)MEXICO CITY, April 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp , the world’s biggest automaker, will spend $1 billion to build a car factory in Mexico and plans to announce the investment on Wednesday, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.The 200,000-cars-a-year factory in the central state of Guanajuato will create about 2,400 direct jobs, one of the people told Reuters, declining to be identified because the plan was not yet public.Reuters reported earlier that the factory - Toyota’s first to build passenger cars in Mexico - would produce the Corolla compact car from the summer of 2019, ending a self-imposed three-year freeze on new investments.President Enrique Pena Nieto will attend the announcement in Mexico on Wednesday, the people said.A Toyota spokeswoman in Tokyo said nothing had been decided.Toyota President Akio Toyoda had declared a pause on expansion to ensure growth did not come at the expense of quality, after the automaker was burned by a recall crisis in 2010.Toyota is vying with Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co to claim the title of top-selling global automaker, with each selling about 10 million vehicles a year.Sources have said Toyota also plans to announce a new car factory in Guangzhou, China, this week.The planned factories in Guanajuato and Guangzhou will add up to 300,000 cars a year to Toyota’s annual production capacity, though not for a few years.The Guanajuato factory would serve as a benchmark for other plants in the region to improve efficiency, boost productivity, and reduce costs, one of the sources said.Under a new framework dubbed Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), Toyota is overhauling the way it develops and builds cars, and has said it would reduce new factory investments by about 40 percent compared with pre-financial crisis levels by making production lines simpler and leaner.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's 7267.T sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T for the first 11 months of 2016 as new models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish in their rankings for full-year sales in the world's top auto market.Chinese consumers have flocked to Honda’s raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan, as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment.To meet rising demand, Japan’s No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a factory in central China’s Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out.Auto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives.SUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars.A Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-��-vis rivals.“We don’t have a blind focus on boosting sales,�� he said. “Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.”Honda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues.“Beating a particular rival brand isn’t our business objective in China,�� a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. “We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.”Honda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October.Toyota, Japan’s top automaker, fell about 50,000 vehicles short of reaching its 1.15 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014.The Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China.(This story corrects sales figure in second to last paragraph)	0.8421231711
* Geely to completely overhaul product portfolio* Aims for 90 pct of sales to be new-energy vehicles by 2020* Says will focus partly on electric-fuel hybrids* Company did not disclose level of investment (Adds detail, context)BEIJING, Nov 18 (Reuters) - China’s Geely Automobile Holdings plans to concentrate entirely on developing green energy vehicles, eschewing traditional combustion engines and completely overhauling its product portfolio, the company said on Wednesday.Geely wants 90 percent of sales to be so-called new-energy vehicles by 2020, the company said in a press release.The carmaker announced the plan, dubbed “Blue Geely��, for new-energy vehicles, which in China refers primarily to battery powered and hybrid cars, ahead of the Guangzhou auto show, which opens on Friday.Geely did not disclose how much it would invest in the scheme.The announcement echoes Toyota Motor Corp’s plans to sell 30,000 fuel-cell cars a year by 2020.Geely is the latest in a series of auto manufacturers to announce such plans, with companies having earmarked about 76 billion yuan ($11.9 billion) this year for future development and production of green cars, according to data compiled by Reuters.The Chinese company, however, lacks Toyota’s expertise in green energy. While the Japanese carmaker has spent heavily on research and development, Geely remains a relative unknown in the field.Geely said it will focus partially on electric-fuel hybrids, akin to the Toyota Prius, a rarity for Chinese automakers. It will also conduct research on hydrogen car technology.China’s government is promoting the development of electric vehicles through subsidies and strict fuel economy standards, viewing green cars as the domestic auto industry’s chance to catch up with global competitors.	0.613447413
Aug 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it will voluntarily recall about 760,000 Toyota RAV4 and 18,000 Lexus HS 250h models in the United States due to issues with the rear suspension arm.Toyota said it has determined that if the nuts on the rear suspension arm are not tightened following the proper procedure during a rear wheel alignment service, the threaded portion of the rear suspension arm may wear and cause the arm to separate.The recall involves 2006 to early 2011 model year RAV4 and 2010 model year Lexus HS 250h vehicles.The company said it was working on a solution to rectify the issue.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers from across the United States gathered in Manhattan Monday to jockey for leadership roles in litigation against General Motors GM.N over a faulty ignition switch that has prompted the recall of millions of vehicles.Nearly 40 lawyers waited for hours to make four-minute pitches to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, who is overseeing the cases, during a marathon hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.Numerous other lawyers have submitted written applications for one of 15 lead spots in the litigation, which so far consists of 109 cases involving claims over personal injuries and diminished vehicle value related to the recall.Since February, GM has recalled 2.6 million vehicles over problems with the ignition switch, and has since recalled millions more with other possible defects.Some well-known lawyers were among those making their cases Monday, including David Boies, a high-profile litigator who has handled marquee same-sex marriage and antitrust cases, and Joseph Rice, who has represented plaintiffs in mass litigation over asbestos, tobacco and the 2010 BP oil spill.Boies, who is applying to serve as one of three lead counsel or alternatively on the 10-member executive committee, said his national profile and his firm’s resources would give plaintiffs an edge in court.“This is an important case, a high-profile case, and you need the very best lawyers,�� he told Furman. “This is not a time for false modesty.”The lawyers Furman appoints will be expected to devote substantial time and resources to litigation efforts up front, in hopes of recovering a sizable share of legal fees from any eventual settlement or judgment.Also seeking top roles Monday were a number of lawyers who led litigation against Toyota Motor Corp over acceleration issues starting in 2010. Furman has appointed Steve Berman, Elizabeth Cabraser and Mark Robinson, who helped spearhead those cases, to serve as temporary lead counsel in the GM litigation. Furman cautioned that the current assignments did not guarantee them a future role.Berman said the Toyota litigation would be a valuable road map for plaintiffs suing GM. Toyota settled economic-loss claims stemming from the acceleration litigation in 2012 in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.“I spent two and a half years of my life dealing with the issues (in Toyota) that we’ll deal with here,�� he told Furman.Furman said he planned to make the appointments by the end of the week.	-0.7420675537
MEXICO CITY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Mexico’s government said on Friday it rejects any attempt to use threats to influence investment in the country, one day after Donald Trump said Japanese automaker Toyota would have to pay a hefty tax to produce cars in Mexico for U.S. consumers.“The Economy Ministry categorically rejects any attempt to influence investment decisions by companies based on fear or threats,�� the ministry said in a brief statement.It made no mention of Toyota or U.S. President-elect Trump.“Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY!

TOKYO (Reuters) - A high-ranking Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T executive believes that it will take the automaker a year to recover from the effects of a diplomatic row between Japan and China, the Kyodo news agency reported on Friday.Calls for boycotts of Japanese goods in response to a territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea took a heavy toll of Toyota’s sales in China, falling 50 percent in September and 44 percent in October.The decline slowed in November, with a 22 percent year-on-year fall to 63,800 vehicles. However, Kyodo said that Hiroji Onishi, senior manager in charge of Toyota’s Chinese operations, gave a grim outlook in a November 26 meeting with the company’s labor union leaders.“We have no choice but to believe it is going to be hard to regain the (pre-September) sales pace,�� Onishi was quoted as saying by Kyodo.“Deducing from past incidents, it would likely take at least one year, and we are making all sorts of adjustments to our plans.”A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on Friday.The company said at the start of this year that it aimed to sell 1 million cars a year in China.	11.18482309
FunPlus Phoenix’s deal to take over Heroic’s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive roster was on the verge of collapsing Saturday with one of the players involved apparently headed in a different direction.Patrick “es3tag�� Hansen is set to leave Heroic to become the sixth player on the Astralis roster, multiple media outlets reported.Last weekend, China-based FPX agreed to take over the CS:GO team of Denmark-based Heroic, and the newly rebranded side debuted March 15 in Flashpoint 1, losing 2-1 to Cloud9.However, before the swap could be finalized, es3tag reportedly made a separate deal to join Denmark-based Astralis, leaving the fate of FPX in Flashpoint 1 uncertain.Heroic CEO Erik Askered issued a statement to HLTV.org on Saturday: “I am unable to comment at this moment, as we are making legal preparations. This is due to the fact that we know and can prove that Astralis has acted in bad faith, and have considerably affected the sale of Heroic to FPX.”Astralis are currently playing in the European division of ESL Pro League Season 11, sitting at 2-1 and tied for second place in Group A.According to Dexerto.com, Astralis coach Danny “zonic�� Sorensen will utilize varied lineups with six players now at his disposal for five positions.Es3tag, a 24-year-old Dane, had been with Heroic since June 2017 after stints with Team Orbit and Tricked Esport, among other teams.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Despite the Dieselgate emissions scandal which has rocked Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, the German carmaker achieved record group sales in 2016 of 10.3 million vehicles, including a 12 percent jump in December.That figure should put VW ahead of Japanese rival Toyota 7203.T as the world's largest car producer by volume.VW sales are proving resilient despite the diesel emissions scandal which has plunged the company into crisis since it came to light in September 2015.VW faces a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency seen potentially costing as much as $4 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations into the scandal, which sources have told Reuters could be announced as soon as Wednesday.On Monday, the company suffered a fresh setback when an executive was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States over the diesel emissions cheating and the company was accused of concealing the matter from regulators.Despite those challenges, however, VW on Tuesday reported a strong finish to 2016.December deliveries including its Audi and Porsche luxury brands rose to 933,300 vehicles from 834,700 a year earlier, with double-digit gains in China and the United States offsetting declines in Germany and Brazil.Its full-year deliveries rose 3.8 percent from 9.93 million in 2015, the company said.Toyota said last month it expected to end 2016 with sales of 10.09 million vehicles, slightly below an initial forecast of 10.11 million.The Japanese rival, which has topped delivery rankings for the past four years but trailed VW at mid-year, is expected to report its 2016 deliveries in early February.NordLB analyst Frank Schwope expects VW to be able to keep the world top carmaker crown this year but said the gap with rivals may shrink as demand in China, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of VW group sales, may weaken because of plans to reduce or phase out tax breaks for small engine cars.“VW is heavily exposed to possible setbacks in China,�� said Schwope who has a “Hold�� recommendation on VW shares.	-5.854390793
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will recall almost 1.37 million more vehicles in the United States due to potentially deadly front passenger-side air bags made by Japan's Takata Corp 7312.T, Toyota said on Tuesday.The expansion pushes the total number of Toyota vehicles recalled in the United States because of dangers posed by Takata air bags to more than 2.9 million.Some Takata air bags have opened with too much force, sending shrapnel into vehicles. U.S. safety officials, as well as Takata officials, have said that exposure to humidity over time has been a factor in the erroneous air bag deployments.Seven deaths linked to Takata air bags have occurred in Honda Motor Co 7267.T cars, six of them in the United States.On Monday, Honda announced the recall of 1.39 million Accord and Civic cars in the United States with faulty front passenger-side Takata air bags. Those cars had previously been recalled for front driver-side air bags.Last month, U.S. safety officials said Takata had doubled its recall of vehicles in the United States to 34 million, and to 53 million globally. Automakers said the number of vehicles affected in the United States is likely half of that total because some have been recalled several times.There have been 24 incidents of incorrect deployments of Takata air bags in Toyota vehicles worldwide, and Toyota has received at least eight reports of injuries said to be linked to air bag ruptures, a Toyota spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Toyota officials have not confirmed those injuries were linked to incorrect deployments, she said.She said that Toyota is not aware of any injuries or fatalities caused by incorrect air bag deployments in the vehicles in the expanded recall it announced on Tuesday.	0.3633128198

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are developing a criminal fraud case hinged on whether General Motors made misleading statements about a deadly ignition switch flaw, and are examining activity dating back a decade, before GM’s 2009 bankruptcy, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation.At the same time, at least a dozen states are investigating the automaker. Two state officials said that effort is likely to focus on whether GM broke consumer protection laws.Both federal and state investigations into the switch, which is linked to at least 13 deaths and 54 crashes, are at early stages, and it is possible that cases may not be brought.Sources said federal criminal prosecutors are working on a set of mail and wire fraud charges, similar to the criminal case Toyota Motor Corp settled earlier this year over misleading statements it made to American consumers and regulators about two different problems that caused cars to accelerate even as drivers tried to slow down.Delphi Automotive, the maker of the GM switch, is not a target of criminal charges, the people said, because it did not make substantial public statements about the safety of the vehicles or the part. That would make it difficult to build a case under the main federal fraud laws, the wire and mail fraud statutes.Greg Martin, a spokesman for GM, said his company continued to work with investigators, declining to comment further, and a spokeswoman for Delphi said the company had been told it was not a target of investigations and was working cooperatively with all government officials. A spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who is leading the criminal probe, declined to comment.Prosecutors are not limiting their inquiries to events that occurred after GM emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, sources said. Legal experts said bankruptcy does not release GM from criminal liability in a fraud case.It is not clear whether prosecutors will bring cases against any individuals.GM has said 15 people were forced out for their roles in the automaker�� s failure to act for more than a decade on signs of the deadly defective switch, which can be jarred out of the “run�� position and deactivate power steering, power brakes and air bags.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said she was not aware of the scope of the problem until January of this year.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration already fined GM $35 million in May for its delayed response to the defective part, and accused company officials of concealing the problem.As they did in their case against Toyota, U.S. Attorney Bharara’s team will try to show that people inside GM knew of the deadly defect even while they were telling regulators the problem was contained and issuing directions to the public about how to handle a car that had lost power.The statement of facts in the Toyota case offers a potential template for the GM case, and one legal expert said GM could end up paying more than Toyota, which settled for $1.2 billion. There are no caps on the penalties that could be imposed on entities guilty of mail fraud or wire fraud.“If the General Motors people think - especially with all the publicity, and the congressional hearings, and all of the public scrutiny that has been brought to bear on this - that $1.2 billion is a number that’s going to resolve all of this, they may well be mistaken,�� said C. Evan Stewart, a defense lawyer at Cohen &amp; Gresser and former special assistant district attorney for Manhattan.Prosecutors said Toyota internally acknowledged a “material�� problem in which some vehicles�� pedals could get trapped under floor mats or stuck in a partially depressed position, but that the company downplayed the problem to NHTSA.Lawyer Anton Valukas, who was hired by GM to investigate the switch matter, details what he called a “history of failures�� to address the problem and inform the public of dangers.His report included numerous examples like a 2005 notice to dealers, directing them to tell customers to remove unessential items from their key chains. After internal discussions, GM eliminated the word “stall�� from the notice because of concerns that the word could worry customers about vehicle safety, the report said.Two years later, according to a filing this year in a class action suit against GM, the company told NHTSA it saw “no specific problem pattern�� in crashes of cars it already knew to have an ignition switch problem, where airbags failed to open.Furthermore, during GM’s bankruptcy proceedings, the company was required to file disclosures to the court about its potential liabilities and known creditors. It did not include any of the people with active legal claims against the company based on ignition switch problems in its list, according to the court filing.The states�� investigation is likely to focus on whether state consumer fraud laws have been violated, targeting unfair and deceptive acts and practices, said William Brauch, director of the consumer protection division at the Iowa Department of Justice.“Multi-state investigations of this kind typically focus on consumer protection related issues,�� added Whitney Ray, a spokesman for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, New York, and South Carolina are all probing GM, representatives said.Brauch said the states have conducted similar investigations in the cases of Firestone tires, Ford SUV rollovers and unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles.Brauch, who is a special assistant attorney general in Iowa, said the AGs might probe whether the manufacturer misrepresented a facet of a product in its advertising, or failed to disclose a known defect.“Our laws allow us to take action in connection with omissions of material fact,�� Brauch said. “Simply putting a defective product in the stream of commerce can, under certain circumstances, constitute unfairness in the consumer fraud laws.”He said he did not believe the states had yet sent GM a demand for information, which is similar to a civil subpoena.Last year, a group of 29 states struck a $29 million settlement with Toyota. The states accused Toyota of engaging in unfair and deceptive practices when it didn’t disclose known safety defects with accelerator pedals.“Toyota is probably a good model to look at in the context of what state attorneys general have done in the past in connection with alleged problems in new vehicles,�� said Brauch. “Is it directly parallel? We don’t know yet.��	-0.8991596639
TOKYO (Reuters) - A pickup in production of Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Model 3 cars, after earlier delays, has resulted in occasional battery cell shortages, a Panasonic Corp 6752.T official said on Thursday in a sign Tesla is in overdrive to meet its end-June forecast.Silicon Valley tech billionaire and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk earlier this month said his company should achieve its 5,000 cars-per-week target by the end of June, provoking scepticism from some Wall Street analysts.Yoshio Ito, head of Panasonic’s automotive business, told the company’s general shareholders meeting on Thursday there had been a “sharp improvement in production�� that was leading to occasional battery (cell) shortages.Panasonic is the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla’s current production models, producing them in Japan as well as at Tesla’s so-called Gigafactory in the U.S. state of Nevada, which Panasonic jointly operates.It also has a joint plant with Tesla to produce solar cells and modules at a new factory in Buffalo, New York.But tying its fortunes to Tesla’s, which has struggled with production bottlenecks, has sometimes looked like a risky bet.A fatal crash in California earlier this year involving a Tesla car and another one in Florida last year has drawn regulatory scrutiny and hurt shares.Tesla said earlier this month that it was cutting several thousand jobs across the company as it seeks to reduce costs and become profitable, without endangering the critical production ramp-up for the sedan, a closely watched metric.“I wouldn’t say the delay (in Tesla’s Model 3 production) had no impact on our business, but we are in close communications with Tesla and working to steadily improve production,�� Ito said.Panasonic sees batteries as central to its plan to boost automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022 from 1.8 trillion yen ($16.3 billion)estimated for this financial year.To reduce the risk of over-relying on Tesla, Panasonic has teamed up with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to jointly develop batteries for electric vehicles.At the shareholders meeting, Panasonic Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga said all solid-state batteries, next-generation batteries considered more stable, are unlikely to hit the automotive market anytime soon, even though the company was engaged in their development.“We believe we can continue to improve performance of today’s lithium-ion batteries at least until around 2025,�� Tsuga said. The commercialization of all solid-state batteries would come after that progress, he said.Toyota is aiming to commercialize all-solid-state batteries by the early 2020s.	4.562708188
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp officials will tell a U.S. House panel on Tuesday that automakers need changes to automotive safety rules to allow the deployment of self-driving cars on American roads.“Without changes to those regulations, it may be years before the promise of today’s technology can be realized and thousands of preventable deaths that could have been avoided will happen,�� said Mike Abelson, vice president of global strategy at GM, in written testimony released Monday. “It is imperative that manufacturers have the ability to test these vehicles in greater numbers.”On Monday, Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, and Senator John Thune, the Republican chairman of the Commerce Committee, said in a joint statement they are exploring legislation that “clears hurdles and advances innovation in self-driving vehicle technology�� and hope to propose a joint bill this year.Under current law, the U.S. Transportation Department can exempt up to 2,500 vehicles in a 12-month period from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) vehicle rules.Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said last month she is preparing legislation that would lift the existing cap.Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, will tell the committee, according to advance testimony: “It is important that the federal government begin looking beyond testing to deployment of these systems�� and should update vehicle safety standards “to address the handful of standards that are inconsistent with or incompatible with autonomous vehicle technology.”According to prepared remarks, Lyft public policy Vice President Joseph Okpaku will tell the panel “our goal to operate a pilot in a major city this year that will permit consumers to enjoy, for the first time, a Lyft in an autonomous vehicle.”Anders Karrberg, vice president of government affairs for Volvo Car Group, a unit of Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, planned to tell the panel its “Drive Me�� pilot testing of autonomous vehicles in Sweden could be extended to the United States but given “uncertainty regarding various U.S. state proposals, laws and regulations�� it is not yet committing.U.S. auto executives told President Donald Trump at a meeting some regulations stand in the way of self-driving vehicles, people briefed on the talks said.NHTSA said in March there are few legal hurdles to the deployment of self-driving cars with human controls, but potential “significant�� hurdles to autonomous vehicles that have no steering wheels or brake pedals.In September, the Obama administration unveiled guidance to states and automakers on self-driving cars. In November, automakers urged the Trump administration to review the guidance, which hasn’t taken effect.Automakers in prepared testimony raised concerns about some states setting restrictive testing rules.Toyota is testing on public roads in Michigan and plans to test in California and Massachusetts. But “both implemented a more restrictive regulatory framework,�� Pratt’s testimony said.	-1.074517341
* Japan businesses under pressure from PM to raise wages* Most plan to raise salaries by at least same degree as last year* But two years of wage raises not enough to offset sales tax hike* Japan’s biggest firms to announce wage plans on Wednesday (Adds link to poll results on firms�� views on Pacific trade pact)By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi NakagawaTOKYO, March 17 (Reuters) - Most Japanese firms plan to raise salaries by at least the same degree as last year, but even two years of wage hikes will not be enough to compensate workers for increases in the cost of living, a Reuters poll showed.Since taking office in late 2012, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has heaped pressure on businesses to lift wages - seen as essential if his stimulus policies are to succeed in boosting consumer spending and dragging the world’s third-largest economy decisively out of decades of deflation and stagnant growth.In results that come a day before Japan’s biggest firms announce wage plans following annual talks with labour unions, the Reuters Corporate Survey showed 55 percent of firms plan to lift wages by the same extent as last year. Another 14 percent say they are set to boost wages more than they did last year.“If big companies raise wages substantially again this year, we may have no choice but to follow suit in order to secure workers regardless of our earnings,�� a manager at a transportation firm wrote.But for employees and Abenomics, the glass is set to look more empty than full, as the increases will not be enough to offset a 3 percentage point increase in the national sales tax that went into effect last April and unexpectedly tipped the economy into recession.When asked how much they expect wages to have increased since the tax hike if plans for this year were included, three quarters of firms expected rises of between zero and 2 percent. Another 17 percent said they expected rises of 2-3 percent.The results underscore the divide between some of Japan’s strongest firms like Toyota Motor Corp which are expected to agree to significant wage increases and the rest of the corporate sector.“Wage hikes appear uneven and slow to spread beyond top companies such as Toyota,�� said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.“Many companies cannot raise wages enough to offset the sales tax hike because they are still facing the lingering pain from the tax hike while struggling to pass on rising costs.”The poll of 483 companies was conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research between March 3 and March 16. Respondents reply anonymously to the survey and around 230 firms answered questions on wages.Last year, the biggest of Japan’s big firms agreed to an average wage hike of 2.19 percent - a 15-year high. Around 0.4 percentage point of that was an increase in closely watched base salaries for all employees, with the rest given over to pay raises that workers get depending on their length of service.Until last year, many big-name Japanese companies had simply frozen base pay levels - as base pay increases are seen as difficult to undo even in the hardest of times.This year, Toyota is expected to agree to a 4,000 yen ($33) base salary hike, equivalent to a rise of 1.1 percent. Including automatic seniority-based rises, salaries for Toyota employees would climb 3.2 percent.But the survey showed that this year 39 percent of firms do not plan to raise base pay at all. Another 39 percent are planning base pay increases of under 1 percent while 19 percent are planning increases of between 1 percent and 2 percent.The survey also found that 55 percent of Japanese companies plan to keep capital spending flat in the year from April. Around a quarter expect to boost capital spending to some extent while 9 percent say they plan big increases.Companies tend to be cautious about spending plans at the beginning of a new fiscal year, revising up as the year progresses.

(Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France is ready to cut its stake in Renault SA in order to consolidate Renault’s partnership with Nissan Motor Co, Agence France Press (AFP) reported on Saturday.Le Maire said Paris, which has a 15% stake in Renault, might consider reducing its stake, if it led to a “more solid�� alliance between the Japanese and French firms, the French news agency reported, citing an interview with the minister.“We can reduce the state’s stake in Renault’s capital. This is not a problem as long as, at the end of the process, we have a more solid auto sector and a more solid alliance between the two great car manufacturers Nissan and Renault,�� he told AFP.Le Maire had earlier said the French government was open to tie-ups involving Renault as long as French industrial interests were protected, and would consider any Renault deal with Fiat Chrysler that respected the French firm’s alliance with its Japanese partner Nissan.Fiat on Thursday abandoned its $35 billion merger offer for Renault, blaming French politics for scuttling what would have been a landmark deal to create the world’s third-biggest automaker behind Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Germany’s Volkswagen.The French government had welcomed the merger plan, but overplayed its hand by pushing for a series of guarantees and concessions that eventually exhausted the patience of FCA, sources told Reuters.Renault and Nissan were not immediately available to respond to a request seeking comment.	2.73706373
RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif., May 27 (Reuters) - Google Inc is building cars that don’t have steering wheels, accelerator pedals or brake pedals, in an ambitious expansion of the Internet company’s efforts to develop self-driving cars.The small electric cars, which seat two passengers, are currently prototypes that Google has been building through partnerships with automotive suppliers and manufacturers, Google co-founder Sergey Brin said at the Code conference in Southern California on Tuesday.Google aims to build up to 200 such cars in the near term and hopes the vehicles will be available in various cities within a couple of years, he said.Google has been testing self-driving cars since 2009, incorporating laser sensors and radars into standard automobiles such as the Prius from Toyota Motor Corp and sport-utility vehicles from Toyota luxury car division Lexus.While those vehicles require a human to remain in the driver’s seat and to take over in certain situations, the new cars operate completely autonomously.Brin said the cars could operate as a service, picking up passengers when summoned, and potentially even operate as fleets of interconnected “trains��.“Ten seconds after getting in I was doing my email, I had forgotten I was there,�� Brin said of his experience riding in one of the pod-like vehicles, which resemble a cross between a Smart car and Volkswagen Beetle. “It ultimately reminded me of catching a chairlift.”Brin declined to specify whether Google intended to build and sell the cars itself, saying only that the company would “work with partners��.The driverless cars are currently limited to a maximum speed of 25 miles (40 km) an hour, but Brin said there was no reason the cars could not go as fast as 100 miles an hour or more once they had been proven to be safe.The front of the cars contain about 2 feet (61 cm) of foam and the windshield is made out of plastic instead of glass to make the cars safer, he said.“Within a couple of years I hope we will surpass the safety metrics we’ve put in place, which is to be significantly safer than a human driver, and we will start testing them without drivers and hopefully you’ll be able to utilize them at some limited cities,�� Brin said.A handful of U.S. states, including California and Nevada, have passed legislation to allow testing of self-driving cars on public roads. Brin said he was optimistic that the new, passenger-only self-driving cars would be approved for testing in the U.S. and overseas in the future. (Editing by Christopher Cushing)	8.124829406
SHANGHAI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd and its two Chinese joint ventures sold 788,276 vehicles in China in 2014, up 4.1 percent from the previous year, the Japanese automaker said on Thursday.In the month of December, Honda sold 142,157 vehicles in China, up 40.1 percent from a year earlier, breaking a streak of five months where it has seen sales decline.Japanese carmakers in China have faced the twin challenges of a slowing economy and political tension between Beijing and Tokyo over the past year.Nissan Motor Co’s China vehicle sales edged up 0.5 percent by volume last year, lagging industry growth of around 7 percent.

PARIS (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA, Europe's No. 2 car maker, is in advanced alliance talks with U.S. peer General Motors GM.N, French online newspaper LaTribune.fr reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.The discussions, which began several months ago and have yet to reach any agreement, go beyond specific production partnerships of the kind PSA already has with automakers including Ford F.N, Toyota 7203.T and BMW BMWG.DE, the newspaper reported.GM spokesman Jim Cain and PSA spokeswoman Caroline Mille both declined to comment on the report.Any deal would have to be approved by the Peugeot family, which holds 30.9 percent of the French automaker’s share capital and 48.3 percent of voting rights, the report said. If an agreement is reached, it could be announced at the Geneva motor show in early March, it added.PSA and GM’s European Opel division both face heavy restructuring to reverse losses that have been compounded by the region’s slumping auto market, industrial overcapacity and cut-throat competition on prices.PSA on February 15 announced a fresh round of cost cuts and put its profitable Gefco logistics business up for sale as it struggles to finance the overseas expansion it badly needs to reduce dependence on its stagnating home markets.Chief Executive Philippe Varin said the same day that the French automaker may open its planned India factory to a new partner, after freezing the project in January to save cash.PSA is also looking for a new partner to replace Fiat FIA.MI when the Italian car maker withdraws from their northern French commercial van joint venture in 2017, Varin said on January 27.Among its existing production deals, PSA currently manufactures diesel engines with Ford, gasoline engines with BMW and small cars with Toyota, as well as sharing some vehicles with Mitsubishi Motors 7211.T. Talks on a deeper alliance with Mitsubishi foundered in 2010.	-0.6523544064

KKR and Goldman Sachs own a combined 34.5 percent stake in Kion, and China’s Weichai Power holds 33.3 percent of shares.	1.182825743

SYDNEY, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Sales of new motor vehicles in Australia jumped by the most in five months in August to reach their highest on record, a sign consumers have the confidence to splash out on big ticket items.Government figures out on Monday showed new vehicle sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 3.6 percent in August to 93,379, following a revised 1.1 percent decline in July. Sales were up 6.4 percent compared to August last year.Sales of sports utility vehicles extended their meteoric run with an increase of 4.3 percent to a fresh all-time high of 26,452. Sales of passenger vehicles rose 4.7 percent, while sales of other vehicles, including trucks, edged up 0.4 percent after a very strong result in July.The robust vehicle numbers contrast with softness seen in retail sales for July and suggest consumer spending is not as weak as some fear.Industry data out earlier in the month showed Toyota retained first place in the sales ladder with 19.2 percent of the market in August.The Holden unit of General Motors held second spot with 12.0 percent.

HONG KONG, March 20 (Reuters) - Government policies to help kickstart Japan’s economy and tackle long-term deflation are creating hope for the country for the first time in 20 years, BlackRock Inc’s Chairman and Chief Executive Laurence Fink said on Wednesday.“The situation in Japan has changed. I am one of those who believe what Japan is doing, it might be on the right path,�� said Fink, who heads the world’s largest asset manager, at the annual Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei stock index has rallied nearly 44 percent since mid-November on the back of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive fiscal and monetary expansion campaign to revive the world’s third biggest economy.The policies known as “Abenomics�� have sparked a fall in the yen, making major exporters like Toyota Motor Corp more competitive. Toyota shares have leapt about 60 percent since November 15.Top executives at Japanese companies are “pretty excited�� about having opportunities to grow for the first time in a long time, Fink said.“For the first time in many years they are going to be able to spend more money in research again,�� Fink said. “For me, this might be the first time in a long time when Japan can reboot itself.”Japan’s decline over the last two decades has largely benefited South Korean companies, he said, after asking the audience how many people used Sony Corp. products now compared to years ago.Fink has headed New York-based BlackRock since it was founded as a fixed-income oriented shop in 1988.

WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German automakers dominated Consumer Reports�� annual ranking of automotive brands released on Tuesday, with Volkswagen AG’s Audi leading the pack, while U.S. brands continued to lag despite gains for many.Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at the magazine, said German automakers rose largely due to improvements in reliability. “Building one or two great vehicles is achievable, but making a whole lineup of excellent ones is much more difficult,�� Fisher said.Volkswagen’s Porsche unit and rival BMW AG came in second and third. General Motors Co’s Buick brand was the highest-ranked U.S. brand in 10th, down from seventh in 2016, while Ford Motor Co’s Lincoln brand was 15th, up from 17th. The Ford brand fell from 16th to 21th.GM’s Chevrolet brand moved up to 17th from 20th and its Cadillac brand moved up to 18th from 24th.Toyota Motor Corp’s flagship brand fell from eighth to 11th place, falling out of the top 10 for the first time in recent years, after the magazine said its Tacoma pickup had reliability issues. Toyota’s luxury Lexus unit fell from third to fourth.Fuji Heavy Industries�� Subaru unit fell from second to fifth, while Korean auto brand Kia jumped to sixth, up five spots, followed by Mazda Motor Corp in seventh.Tesla Inc was ranked eighth among auto brands after previously not having enough models to be ranked. The California automaker was followed by Honda Motor Co’s namesake brand in ninth.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Chrysler brand jumped from 26th to 19th.GM’s Chevrolet Cruze was named best compact car, while its Impala won best large sedan.Other top picks included the Honda Ridgeline as best compact pickup, Kia Optima best midsized sedan and Audi Q7 best luxury SUV.Nissan Motor Co’s luxury Infiniti brand moved up six spots to 16, while its Nissan brand fell one spot to 22.Some German automakers struggled. The Volkswagen brand fell eight spots to 23rd and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz fell six spots to 20th.The Fiat brand remained last again among all brands rated, and FCA’s Jeep brand remained second-lowest overall. Consumer Reports does not recommend any Fiat Chrysler vehicles, while it recommends all Porsche, Mazda and BMW vehicles.Fisher said Fiat Chrysler models suffered from serious reliability problems and are “not competitive�� in most segments.

"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N said on Tuesday it is slashing the price of its Chevrolet Volt electric car by $5,000 to help boost demand for the plug-in hybrid in a segment still struggling to gain a foothold in the U.S. auto market.The price cut for the 2014 model will lower the price to $34,995, including delivery fees before federal tax credits. Pricing could fall as low as $27,495 with the tax credit.“We have made great strides in reducing costs as we gain experience with electric vehicles and their components,�� Don Johnson, U.S. vice president for Chevy sales, said in a statement.GM did not quantify the cost savings for the 2014 model, but has said the next version of the Volt, due in 2015, will cost $7,000 to $10,000 less. The 2014 models will begin arriving at dealer stores later this month.“Chevrolet has quickly discovered that when price savings at the pump and ultimately value are your key selling points, a $40,000 cost of entry makes for a difficult hurdle to overcome for most budget conscious consumers,�� Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Alec Gutierrez said. He expects GM to roll out aggressively priced lease deals on the new Volt.The 2014 Volt will offer consumers the equivalent fuel economy of 98 miles per gallon on electric power and 40 miles per gallon when powered by its gasoline engine. The car can drive almost 40 miles on its electric charge, with 380 miles of total driving range.Several automakers have slashed prices on their electric cars to help overcome consumer qualms about high costs and fears about driving range, and are pushing to develop the technology in hopes the vehicles could become a bigger seller as fuel-efficiency requirements rise globally.Through July, sales of electric vehicles in the United States had more than doubled from last year to almost 49,000 vehicles, according to website hybridcars.com, but still only 0.54 percent of the overall market. In the same period, Volt sales were up 9 percent to 11,643 vehicles.In January, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T cut the price of its Leaf EV by more than $6,000, and in May Honda Motor Co 7267.THMC.N slashed the lease price of its electric-powered Fit subcompact car by one-third. In July, Ford Motor Co F.N reduced the price of its 2014 electric Focus by 10 percent.GM had cut the price of the 2013 model Volt by $5,000 to help boost demand. In late May it launched the Chevy Spark electric vehicle with a lower-than-expected starting price of $27,495 and is offering discounted leases on both cars.The Volt price cut is another step in GM's effort to seize the mantle of ""greenest automaker in the world"" from Toyota Motor Corp 7203.TTOYOF.PK, which makes the popular Prius hybrid car. Toyota also sells a plug-in version of the Prius.GM is aiming by 2017 to build up to 500,000 vehicles a year with some form of electric engine power, including the Volt, Spark EV and those with its eAssist system that boost fuel efficiency in gas-powered cars.GM will begin building the Cadillac ELR plug-in electric couple late this year."	-1.575729069

(Corrects the driving range of fuel cell vehicle in paragraph 10)* Increases planned eco-friendly product range with 3 plug-ins* Electric version of Kona SUV planned for first half of 2018* Developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platformBy Hyunjoo JinSEOUL, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co said on Thursday it was placing electric vehicles at the centre of its product strategy - one that includes plans for a premium long-distance electric car as it seeks to catch up to Tesla and other rivals.Like Toyota Motor Corp, Hyundai had initially championed fuel cell technology as the future of eco-friendly vehicles but has found itself shifting electric as Tesla shot to prominence and battery-powered cars have gained government backing in China.Toyota is now also working on longer distance, fast-charging electric vehicles, local media have reported.The South Korean automaker is planning to launch an electric sedan under its high-end Genesis brand in 2021 with a range of 500 km (310 miles) per charge. It will also introduce an electric version of its Kona small sport utility vehicle (SUV) with a range of 390 km in the first half of next year.“We’re strengthening our eco-friendly car strategy, centering on electric vehicles,�� Executive Vice President Lee Kwang-guk told a news conference, calling the technology mainstream and realistic.The automaker and affiliate Kia Motors Corp, which together rank fifth in global vehicle sales, also said they were adding three plug-in vehicles to their plans for eco-friendly cars, bringing the total to 31 models by 2020.Underscoring Hyundai’s electric shift, those plans include eight battery-powered and two fuel-cell vehicles - a contrast to its 2014 announcement for 22 models, of which only two were slated to be battery-powered.Hyundai also confirmed a Reuters report that it is developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platform, which will allow the company to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges.Last year, it launched its first mass-market pure electric car IONIQ, but the vehicle’s per-charge driving range is much shorter than offerings from Tesla and General Motors.Hyundai unveiled a near production version of its new fuel cell SUV with a driving range of more than 580 km per charge, compared with the 415 km for its current Tucson fuel cell SUV.The mid-sized SUV will be launched in Korea early next year, followed by U.S. and European markets.A fuel cell electric bus is slated to be unveiled late this year, while a sedan-type fuel cell car is also planned. Even so, analysts noted that gaining traction with fuel cells was going to be a long hard slog.“Hyundai will achieve fuel cell economies of scale by 2035 at the earliest,�� Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics &amp; Trade.“Before that, Hyundai has no choice but to rely on battery cars,�� he said.

DETROIT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Zhongsheng Group Holdings Ltd , a large Chinese auto dealership group, said consumer financing is fast gaining acceptance in China, which will help boost the market as well as encourage younger buyers to buy more expensive cars.Currently only one fifth of car buyers use financing at Zhongsheng’s 160 dealerships, with the rest paying cash. Countrywide, that ratio is even less with only 10 percent of consumers using financing.Huang Yi, chairman and co-founder of the dealer group, says a conservative estimate calls for financing at Zhongsheng to rise to 30 percent within five years, adding that in 10 years, that should rise to more than half of new car buyers.Younger buyers are less averse to taking on debt than their parents, Huang said in an interview on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.“For young people, maybe for no financing they can buy a car less than 100,000 yuan ($15,950), if they use financing they can buy a car of 200,000 yuan ($31,900),�� Huang said.The world’s biggest auto market saw sales rise 4.3 percent last year to 19.3 million vehicles and China’s auto industry body expects a climb of 7 percent this year.Brands that are the most aggressive in offering financing at Zhongsheng’s dealerships are Toyota Motor Corp’s namesake brand and its luxury brand Lexus, and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz brand, Huang said.Those who finance their cars now typically pay 30 percent of a vehicle’s price as down payment and the loans have interest of 7 percent to 8 percent, Huang said.Huang also said that the company’s sales of Japanese brands has nearly fully recovered after the territorial row in mid-September that sparked anti-Japanese sentiment in China. That cut sales of Japanese brands at Zhongsheng stores by 70 percent, Huang said.In the last two weeks of December, sales of Toyota and Nissan Motor Co had returned to nearly 90 percent of levels before the dispute over ownership of islands in the East China Sea.Toyota reported a 16 percent decline in China sales for the whole month of December while Nissan reported a 24 percent fall.Zhongsheng, whose dealerships stretch from Heilongjiang province in the north to Guangdong in the south, expects to double the amount of its dealerships in the next five years.	8.410819949
BEIJING (Reuters) - China, the world’s biggest automobile market, rolled out fresh policies to support hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to improve the industry’s supply chain and technologies, the finance ministry said on Monday.China is also the world’s largest market for new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include battery electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.While previous policies to support NEV makers had offered subsidies on sales, the fresh rollout will require local governments and companies to build a more mature supply chain and business model for the industry.Local governments and companies need to prove their joint projects are able to lower the price of hydrogen fuel, increase the number of hydrogen-charging stations, enlarge hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleets and improve related technologies, according to the document.Authorities will offer rewards to the projects after an assessment of these key performance areas, the ministry said.The rollout comes a few days after Reuters reported that China’s policymakers and the government may publish a fresh policy, citing people familiar with the matter.China has over 7,000 hydrogen vehicles, compared with over 4 million pure battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.Global automakers including Toyota Motor 7203.T and Hyundai Motor 005380.KS have already announced launch plans for hydrogen vehicles in China.	1.463191587
* Despite upbeat earnings, yen’s rise poses risk to shares* Topix continues to outperform Nikkei on small-cap strength* Mazda rises on Toyota tie-up news, Suzuki soars on earningsTOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average slipped on Friday as the yen’s rise to seven-week highs overshadowed optimism on corporate earnings, while Mazda Motor rose ahead of an expected announcement of a capital alliance with Toyota Motor.The Nikkei shed 0.4 percent by mid-morning trade, but stayed flat on the week. The trading range in which it has remained since mid-June has narrowed.A surprisingly soft reading on U.S. services sector sapped risk appetite and helped to bring down the dollar to a seven-week low of 109.85 yen on Friday.“If the dollar falls below 110 yen, many companies will have to change their assumption on the exchange rates. That means risk of downward revision to the current optimism on earnings. We are at a watershed now,�� said Seiki Orimi, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Japanese companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far saw a 12.9 percent rise in operating profit, with 60 percent of them beating market expectations, according to Okasan Securities.Market players also noted, however, that many shares tended to fall, or quickly lose gains, even if their earnings were in line with expectations.Shares of Kirin Holdings fell 4.0 percent on Friday after Japan’s largest beverage company by market value raised its annual operating profit outlook by 4.1 percent, slightly less than analysts had expected.Lion fell 6.8 percent after the earnings of the manufacturer of toothpaste and other toiletry goods came in line with expectations.On the other hand, Suzuki Motor jumped 7.8 percent after the automaker’s profits for the quarter beat market expectations.Among other automakers, Mazda Motor jumped more than 5 percent. Mazda and rival Toyota Motor Corp are expected to announce plans on Friday to build a $1.6 billion U.S assembly plant as part of a new joint venture, a person briefed on the matter said.Toyota shares rose 0.3 percent.The broader Topix fell 0.3 percent, maintaining its outperformance versus the Nikkei since June thanks to strength in small-cap shares.The so-called NT ratio, which measures the Nikkei’s value relative to the Topix, fell to 12.25, its lowest level since February 2016.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Snow-choked roads cut off thousands on Tuesday as parts of Japan struggled to dig out from its second storm in a week, with the death toll rising to at least 23.Train services were suspended in some areas after the Valentine’s Day storm dumped more than a meter of snow in parts of central Japan and blanketed the capital with record snow for the second weekend in a row, snarling airline traffic and slowing production at some Japanese automakers.The freak storm dumped more than 1.1 meters of snow in Yamanashi prefecture in central Japan, the most in more than a century of record-keeping, and lesser amounts across a wide swathe of the eastern and northeastern parts of the nation. Tokyo was hit by 27 cm (10.6 inches).By Tuesday, least 23 people had died, including some killed in traffic accidents or by being caught under snow that fell from roofs. Several died in cars stuck in the snow, apparently from carbon monoxide poisoning as they ran their car engines to keep warm.At the peak of the storm, thousands of households lost power and hundreds of flights were canceled. Train services were disrupted and highways closed, with some of the nation’s main arteries jammed with cars, some for days.Toyota Motor Corp resumed operations at three plants in central Japan on Tuesday after suspending them a day earlier due to disruption in the supply of parts, but the outlook was unclear for another Toyota plant.

Toyota raised its annual operating profit forecast to 2.0 trillion yen from 1.85 trillion yen and also said it will buy back 1.5 percent of its own shares, worth 250 billion yen. Insurers and banks lost ground, with T&amp;D Holdings declining 2.1 percent, MS&amp;AD Insurance dropping 0.6 percent and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group falling 0.9 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp warned profit this financial year would fall for the first time in eight years as costs to boost battery output rise and it moves to overhaul some businesses amid investor pressure to find new avenues of growth.The Japanese conglomerate expects operating profit for the year through March 2020 to slump 27 percent to 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) from a year earlier. That is well below analyst expectations of a 12 percent decline, according to Refinitiv.The company is looking at a 15 billion yen loss at its automotive unit this year, it said on Thursday. Panasonic expects costs to ramp up battery production in Japan and China for a planned electric-vehicle (EV) battery joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp to weigh heavily.Panasonic switched its focus to corporate clients such as automakers a few years ago to escape price wars in lower-margin consumer electronics.The shift, which involved a vast migration of TV engineers to the automotive unit, helped the company restore profit growth, but its non-consumer businesses did not grow as fast as the company had hoped.“Over the last three years, we aimed for stable revenue and profit growth focusing mainly on the automotive business ... but development costs and insufficient abilities to adjust to rapid battery production expansion limited our profits,�� Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga said.The business was also squeezed last year due to production delays for Tesla Inc’s mass-market Model 3 sedan.Panasonic is Tesla’s exclusive supplier of battery cells and industry watchers have said the Japanese company needs to cut its reliance on the U.S. electric carmaker.Elon Musk, Tesla’s mercurial CEO, last month blamed Panasonic for the production delays. He previously said Tesla was looking for other battery suppliers for its new Shanghai car factory.Tsuga, however, told a post-earnings press conference on Thursday that Panasonic’s relationship with Tesla remained good.“We are not just a supplier but a partner,�� he said.Panasonic is set to deepen its partnership with Toyota, announcing earlier on Thursday they would establish a joint company to develop “connected�� services to be used in homes and urban development.Panasonic also said it would sell its solar battery research arm and a solar battery plant in Malaysia to China’s GS-Solar for an undisclosed amount.	3.494803889
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Motors and Toyota Motor are among the major automakers making a song and dance about their commitment to reducing emissions. The $225 billion Japanese manufacturer was a pioneer of mass-market hybrid cars with its Prius lineup; it’s also trying to develop hydrogen fuel cells. GM, meanwhile, talks about its commitment to zero emissions, along with zero crashes and zero congestion. But on Monday both decided, along with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Hyundai Motor, to back a White House push to strip California of its right to set its own tailpipe-emissions standards.The four, along with a couple of lobby groups, are pitching the matter as merely a legal issue, with Washington, D.C. alone setting emissions standards. The Golden State wants to push ahead with rules to improve average fleet fuel economy to some 47 miles per gallon, whereas the administration of President Donald Trump wants to reduce average fuel efficiency to 37 mpg. Ford Motor, Honda Motor, Volkswagen and BMW, as well as 22 other states, have already sided with California.It’s true that companies benefit from clear, settled regulation. Having to meet a variety of different standards in different parts of the same country increases complexity and cost. Sensible federal rules for such things are the better answer, other things being equal.That doesn’t wash in this instance, though. For starters, there are short-term financial incentives at play. The highest-margin products automakers sell are gas-guzzling, high-emissions SUVs and light trucks. They can sell more of them if on average they only have to hit the White House’s lower fuel-economy target than the Barack Obama-era rule that California is keeping alive.SUVs and the like helped the $55 billion GM increase by 6% its third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes compared to the same period last year, the company revealed on Tuesday, despite a debilitating strike by workers. And they ensured the company run by Mary Barra posted a healthy operating margin of 10.2% in North America.That ought to put GM in a strong position to take the lead on better battery technology to reduce reliance on ozone-depleting fossil fuels. Monday’s decision, though, shows executives are delaying GM’s non-polluting future as long as possible.	0.8559919436
DETROIT, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling about 780,000 crossovers and hybrid sedans in the United States for a second time to repair a suspension defect that was not properly fixed last year, a Toyota spokeswoman said on Monday.The Japanese automaker first recalled the 2006 through 2011 RAV4 crossover and the 2010 Lexus HS250 hybrid sedan in August 2012 to prevent the rear suspension arm from wobbling, which could cause rust and lead to a crash.But Toyota found that the nuts used to adjust the rear wheel alignment may not have been properly tightened, according to documents posted online by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.As a result, Toyota must take the rare step of recalling those models again. Under the new repair, Toyota will seal the rear lower suspension arms with an epoxy to prevent corrosion.Due to a limited availability of parts, Toyota will launch the recall in stages until February 2014. Toyota began fixing 2006-2008 model year vehicles last month in the Boston area. It will inspect 2009-2011 models nationwide in mid-February.As of the end of June, Toyota had inspected and fixed 20,400 vehicles. Nearly 482,000 were inspected and found not to need a fix, according to U.S. auto safety regulators. (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; editing by Matthew Lewis)	2.841890407
* GM beats expectations, other major automakers miss* Truck sales still strong but growth slows* Detroit automakers post double-digit gains* 1.2 million industry total falls short of forecasts* Analysts remain mixed on longer-term outlookBy Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The 16-day U.S. government shutdown in early October appeared to dampen consumers�� appetite for new cars, as seven of the top eight automakers reporting monthly sales on Friday missed analysts�� expectations.Industry sales in October rose 10.6 percent to 1,208,036 vehicles, according to industry research firm Autodata. Analysts had expected a 12 percent increase.Sales for the three Detroit-based automakers, driven partly by steady demand for full-size pickup trucks, rose by double digits from a year earlier, but only General Motors Co beat expectations.October sales dipped to an annual rate of 15.23 million vehicles, according to Autodata, the lowest rate since April.The weaker-than-expected sales rate “was primarily driven by the government shutdown impacting consumer sentiment through the first half of the month,�� Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said on Friday in a briefing note to clients.Analysts had forecast stronger performances in October from Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group LLC, as well as from Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co and Volkswagen AG.GM said October sales climbed nearly 16 percent to 226,402 vehicles from 195,764 a year ago, with all four GM brands reporting year-to-year increases, led by Buick, up 31 percent. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, expected GM sales of 211,563.Results at Ford and Chrysler narrowly missed analysts�� expectations, as did those at Toyota, Honda and Nissan.Ford said October U.S. sales increased 14 percent to 191,985 vehicles, from 168,456 a year earlier. Ford and Lincoln brand sales both rose during the month. Analysts expected 194,301.Chrysler reported October sales of 140,083, up 11 percent from 126,185 a year ago. Analysts expected 143,536.Toyota sales rose 8.8 percent to 168,976 vehicles, while Honda was up 7.1 percent to 114,538 and Nissan was up 14.2 percent to 91,018. Analysts expected 176,815 at Toyota, 119,823 at Honda and 93,632 at Nissan.Hyundai Motor Co said group sales in the United States rose 0.6 percent to 93,309. Hyundai brand sales climbed 6.5 percent to 53,555 while Kia sales dropped 6.4 percent to 39,754.Analysts said vehicle demand began to pick up after the government resumed working at mid-month.“The market seemed to respond pretty quickly and the cadence (of sales) seemed to improve,�� said Itay Michaeli, analyst at Citi Research. “That, I think, is a testament to some of the pent-up demand out there.”Added GM’s chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem: “It’s like what we’ve seen with oil prices in recent years where people are getting accustomed to some of the noise coming out of Washington. It may change people’s perspective on exactly when to pull the trigger on buying a new vehicle, but we’re not seeing much of an impact on the longer-term trend, which has been very positive.”Sales of full-size pickups, buoyed by a steady housing market and lower gasoline prices, continued to show strength in October, although their torrid year-long pace slowed a bit.Ford’s F-series was up 13 percent for the month and up 20 percent for the year to date, while Chrysler’s Ram was up 18 percent for the month and 23 percent for the year to date. The Chevrolet Silverado was up 10 percent for the month and 20 percent for the year.Average transaction prices for all full-size trucks in October jumped more than 5 percentage points from a year ago, to $39,189, according to Kelley Blue Book.“The truck segment will remain hotly contested through the rest of this year,�� said analyst Alec Gutierrez of Kelley Blue Book, with GM spending less than Ford and Chrysler to promote its Silverado and Sierra.Volkswagen AG’s U.S. subsidiary said VW brand sales fell 18 percent to 28,129 vehicles. The German automaker’s upscale Audi brand reported record sales of 13,001, up 11 percent, with Porsche boosting sales 11 percent to 3,562. Group sales of 44,692 were down 9 percent from a year ago, missing analysts�� expectations of 48,654.Consumer demand for electrified vehicles remain mixed. October sales of GM’s Chevrolet Volt dropped 32 percent to 2,022, while Nissan Leaf climbed 27 percent to 2,002.With the U.S. economy still in low gear and the next round of congressional budget and debt negotiations looming in early 2014, analysts remain mixed in their longer-range outlook.“If we could ever get some strong economic footing in this country to drive lower unemployment (and higher consumer) confidence, I think we’ve got a dam that’s still waiting to burst,�� said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book.GM shares were up 1.2 percent at $37.38 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, while Ford shares were down 1.5 percent at $16.86.	-4.265987811
VIENNA, May 30 (Reuters) - Baghdad has turned to France’s Total and Japan’s Toyota for gasoline after Washington blacklisted an Iranian company that had been delivering product, industry sources said on Thursday.Sima General Trading Company, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), had been supplying Iraq with up to three cargoes of gasoline per month - about a quarter of what Iraq now imports.But in mid-March, the U.S. Treasury Department identified the company as part of a UAE-based network of Iranian government front companies that did business on behalf of previously sanctioned entities such as Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO)- a unit of the National Iranian Oil Co.Washington persuaded Baghdad to stop the trade - worth over $40 million a month at current prices - the sources said, and Total and Toyota will step in from June through the end of the year. They join a pool of companies supplying Iraq.Total will supply two cargoes of gasoline a month and Japan’s Toyota will supply one, according to the industry sources. Each cargo is roughly 15,000 tonnes. Total will deliver its first shipment in June 13-15.“We are asking for Iraq, as well as other countries, to reduce the import of crude oil and oil products such as gasoline from Iran,�� said a U.S. diplomat.“Both Treasury and State have been very active in talking with our international partners.”Due to the size of Iraq’s oil products tenders, traders closely monitor purchases by its State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO).SOMO could not be reached for immediate comment.SOMO last November finalised a deal to buy 1.56 million tonnes of gasoline from a pool of suppliers and the contract was awarded to rival oil firms Vitol and Glencore, along with oil major BP and Sima.Despite being OPEC’s second largest crude oil producer, years of violence, militant attacks and low investment have forced Iraq to rely on imports to meet demand for oil products like gasoline as its own refineries struggle.

(Reuters) - A car dealer is taking down an oversized mannequin that had been placed atop a roadside billboard advertisement in rural Iowa after a number of alarmed drivers called the 911 emergency number to report a man who looked like he was going to jump.“I hate to take it down, but in the interest of public safety I decided to,�� Brad Deery, owner of 10 car dealerships in Iowa, told Reuters by telephone on Friday.Deery said the sheriff in Des Moines County asked him to remove the mannequin because drivers were becoming distracted and that some could be tempted to try to climb the sign and take a selfie.The billboard on U.S. Route 61 advertises Deery’s West Burlington dealership. The sign reads “I can see Deery Toyota, Nissan, Mazda from here,�� Deery said.The mannequin is posed as though it is looking off at distant car lots.The Hawk Eye, a local newspaper, reported that the Des Moines County Sheriff’s Department was concerned after receiving 911 calls and requested the removal of the mannequin.

EditorsNote: adds quotes, agate to NASCAR Wire Service storyJohnson earns sixth Sprint Cup titleBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeHOMESTEAD, Fla. -- Denny Hamlin found redemption for a lost season, as Jimmie Johnson advanced to the threshold of legend.Sidelined for four races with a broken back earlier in the season, Hamlin took the checkered flag in Sunday’s Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, as Johnson claimed his sixth NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship with a ninth-place finish.Johnson finished the season 19 points ahead of polesitter and race runner-up Matt Kenseth, who held off a furious charge by third-place Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the closing laps. With six NASCAR Sprint Cup titles, Johnson is one behind all-time leaders Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt.The title was a record 11th for team owner Rick Hendrick.“I don’t even know where to start,�� Johnson said after the race. “I’m at a loss for words, but I’m so proud and so thankful for this opportunity at Hendrick Motorsports. I’m thankful that Jeff Gordon and Rick Hendrick gave me this opportunity back in 2002.“This sport is about people, and our people at Hendrick Motorsports -- especially on this 48 car -- rose up and got the job done. I’m so thankful to be able to drive for this race team and so honored and so excited to have a ��six-pack.’�Hamlin won for the first time this season, the second time at Homestead and the 23rd time in his career. The driver of the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota has won at least one race in each of his eight full seasons in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.As elated as he was with the victory, Hamlin took time to acknowledge the excellence of Johnson and his No. 48 team. Johnson’s average finish in the 10 Chase races was 5.1.“I think they do a great job of being consistent,�� Hamlin said. “Really, I’d say with everyone else in the Chase, you can almost count on them having one bad race. The 48, they just never have that one bad race. I don’t know how to explain it, but they just don’t make any mistakes. You have to beat him on performance. To do that, that’s really hard.“Unfortunately, we’re racing during the Jimmie Johnson Era. We’re just unlucky in that sense. I think being out there and racing with him, I can say that I think he’s the best that there ever was.”Martin Truex Jr. completed his tenure at Michael Waltrip Racing with a fourth-place run, one spot ahead of teammate Clint Bowyer. Brad Keselowski, Kyle Busch, Joey Logano, Johnson and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top 10.Johnson’s path to the title was far from easy. Moments after a restart on Lap 194, Paul Menard rammed the back of Johnson’s No. 48 Chevrolet as the outside line checked up. The impact jerked Johnson’s car sideways, but the five-time champion was able to regain control and keep the car off the outside wall.His momentum sapped, however, Johnson plummeted to 23rd in the running order, the precise finishing position he needed to secure his sixth championship. Over the next nine laps, Johnson recovered to 16th and drove the No. 48 out of the danger zone.From that point on, he advanced as high as sixth before finishing ninth, and the sixth NASCAR Sprint Cup title was his.“I had contact from behind that pushed me into the 20 (Kenseth), and both of us were out of control and sliding toward the outside fence at that point,�� Johnson said. “I didn’t know what to think. That got us mired back in traffic and made the last 50 laps kind of interesting.“We still had an awesome race car and got the job done.”NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Race -- Ford EcoBoost 400Homestead-Miami SpeedwayHomestead, FloridaSunday, November 17, 20131.

LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Japanese conglomerate Toyota Tsusho Corp (TTC) will launch a global sugar trading operation within months, their director of sugar trading said on Thursday.Toyota is already a global metals trader but this marks its first international trading venture in agricultural commodities beyond trading activities focused on Japan’s domestic market.Richard O’Connor, previously at international trade house Bunge, has hired 11 staff including physical and futures traders and said the London-based team would begin trading early in the new year.Toyota already buys raw sugar for Japanese refiners but the new desk would have an international focus, O’Connor said.“Within two or three years we’re aiming to trade 1 million tonnes per annum on the physical market,�� said O’Connor, adding that the company’s capital backing would make it an attractive trade partner from a risk perspective.Expansion of the sugar operations by acquisitions is also a possibility down the track, O’Connor said.“Once we’ve started trading if we see opportunities to invest anywhere, either at origination at destination, we’ll look at it.�� (Reporting by Sarah McFarlane, editing by William Hardy)	6.50624927

TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Japanese truck maker Hino Motors Ltd is likely to miss its sales targets in Indonesia and Thailand this financial year because of slowing economic growth and increasing competition, its president said on Friday.Hino, 50.1 percent owned by Toyota Motor Corp, still expects sales in its second- and third-largest markets after Japan to grow year-on-year, though the pace of growth is slowing, President Yasuhiko Ichihashi told Reuters.He declined to give specific figures.Hino projects sales of 38,200 vehicles in Indonesia in the year ending March 2014, an increase of 14 percent from the year earlier, and 24,800 vehicles in Thailand, up 36 percent.It forecasts operating profit of 85 billion yen ($859 million) this financial year, compared with an average 106 billion yen estimated in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 12 analysts.Ichihashi declined to comment on whether Hino will revise its operating profit forecast.

GDYNIA, Poland, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Poland’s new car registrations rose by 0.58 percent year on year to 51,335 in January, helped by strong activity from companies buying vehicles for business use, the Samar research institute said on Tuesday.Registrations were also boosted by the sale of cars from the previous year which is normal for this time of year, Samar said.Registrations fell, however, by 1.98 percent from December, 2018.The share of institutional buyers reached 62 percent in January, indicating another year of business clients dominating the new car market.About 12 percent of cars registered in January, around 6,000 vehicles, probably left the country immediately after registration, Samar said.Skoda, the Czech subsidiary of Volkswagen, remained the top seller in January, with a 13.77 percent market share. It was followed by Volkswagen and Toyota, with 11.60 and 10.77 percent market share respectively.The most popular model in January was the Skoda Octavia.

DETROIT, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co dropped another seven spots to next to last place in an important annual survey of vehicle reliability due to flaws in its touch-screen navigation system and other issues with its new or redesigned models.In a Consumer Reports survey released Monday, Ford fell to 27th place of 28 brands surveyed, while its upscale Lincoln brand fell 12 spots to 26th place.Scion, Toyota Motor Corp’s youth-oriented brand, kept its spot as the most reliable brand. Toyota gained four spots to the No. 2 spot.The results represent a dramatic drop for Ford, which placed in the top 10 two years ago, with more than 90 percent of its models being average or better.Sixty percent of Ford’s models and half of the Lincoln models were rated below average this year. None of the vehicles placed above average.The top seven spots were occupied by Japanese brands this year, the survey showed. General Motors Co’s Cadillac was the highest-ranking U.S. brand. It rose 10 spots to 11th place.Ford was also hurt in the rankings because three of the automaker’s most reliable models, the Escape crossover and Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans, were not included in the survey. Consumer Reports does not have recent reliability data on these three models, which were redesigned for the 2013 model year.	11.66903317
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor said on Tuesday that it will partner with Cisco Systems to develop Internet-connected car technology, part of the automaker’s push to develop “high-performing computers on wheels��.Auto and tech firms are increasingly forming alliances to expand services that hook cars up to Internet, particularly as the race to develop self-driving cars heats up.Hyundai said Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun met Cisco Chief Executive Chuck Robbins in Seoul and agreed to co-develop in-vehicle network technology for high-speed transfer of large amounts of data.“The cooperation is part of Hyundai Motor’s wider strategy to establish an industry-leading connected car platform through collaboration with leading technology partners,�� it said in a statement.Other alliances include Toyota Motor Corp’s expansion this month of a five-year-old partnership with Microsoft Corp to develop new Internet-connected vehicle services for owners and dealers.	-4.861509074
(Corrects sixth paragraph to say that Toyota sold roughly 3,000 Mirai cars between December 2014 and February 2017, not January 2016 and February 2017, in line with company correction)SHANGHAI, April 18 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp will start testing hydrogen fuel-cell cars in China from October, part of an effort to determine the feasibility of selling its Mirai hydrogen electric passenger car in the market.The head of the Japanese automaker’s China business, Hiroji Onishi, said the carmaker also planned to build a hydrogen fuel station in the city of Changshu in eastern Jiangsu province in time for the start of the tests.Mirai, which means “future�� in Japanese, is a four-person sedan first introduced in 2014 that has a range of 300 miles, and is Toyota’s first mass-market fuel cell car.Toyota wants to test the car’s performance and the quality of locally available hydrogen in China, Onishi said.He was speaking at a media event ahead of the Shanghai auto show, which opens later this week.Toyota began selling the Mirai in Japan in late 2014. The cars is now available in the United States as well as some markets in Europe. Since December 2014 and through February this year, Toyota had sold roughly 3,000 Mirai fuel-cell cars globally, according to the company.Onishi reiterated that Toyota would start selling plug-in electric hybrid cars next year in China. He added the firm aimed to sell an all-electric battery car in the China market, but did not give a timeframe for the plan.

(Reuters) - Auto companies and suppliers around the world are ramping up production of critical healthcare products and machines - everything from cloth face masks to sophisticated ventilator systems - to meet a critical shortage of those items at hospitals and care facilities in North America, Europe and Asia.Here is a look at what some companies have announced.General Motors Co said it will partner with Washington-based Ventec Life Systems to make ventilators at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana, electrical components plant as soon as April, at the rate of 10,000 a month, up to 200,000 units. GM also will make surgical masks at its Warren, Michigan, facility, starting in early April and ramping up to 50,000 masks a day, with the ability to double that.Ford Motor Co said it would partner with GE Healthcare to expand production of GE’s ventilators, while developing a simplified design that Ford could build at one of its plants. Ford also said it will work with 3M Co to increase production of 3M’s respirators, while also developing a simpler model to be built in a Ford plant. The automaker said it may make face shields for first responders to use with N95 respirator masks at an undisclosed Michigan plant, at a rate of up to 100,000 a week.Toyota Motor Corp said it is finalizing deals with at least two companies to help increase production of ventilators and respirators. It expects to begin mass-producing 3D-printed face shields next week, and is seeking partners to make filters for face masks.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said it will begin making more than 1 million face masks a month, to be distributed initially to first responders and healthcare workers in North America.Tesla Inc said it would reopen its Buffalo, New York, solar panel plant to produce Medtronic ventilators. The company also said it bought 1,255 ventilators in China and is distributing them in North America.China’s BYD Co said it had opened the world’s largest face mask plant in China, making 5 million masks a day, plus 300,000 bottles of disinfectant.The joint venture between SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, GM and Wuling is converting one of its China plants to make face masks and is building additional machines to increase mask production.GAC is converting one of its China plants to make face masks.Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said it is testing 3D printers to make parts for ventilators.Mahindra CIE Automotive Ltd said it is working with a ventilator manufacturer in India to help simplify the design and scale up production, including at some Mahindra plants.	-0.8145663632

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is working on an electric car powered by a new type of battery that significantly increases driving range and reduces charging time, aiming to begin sales in 2022, the Chunichi Shimbun daily reported on Tuesday.Toyota’s new electric car, to be built on an all-new platform, will use all-solid-state batteries, allowing it to be recharged in just a few minutes, the newspaper said, without citing sources.By contrast, current electric vehicles (EVs), which use lithium-ion batteries, need 20-30 minutes to recharge even with fast chargers and typically have a range of just 300-400 kilometers (185-250 miles).Toyota has decided to sell the new model in Japan as early as 2022, the paper said.Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi said the company would not comment on specific product plans but added that it aimed to commercialize all-solid-state batteries by the early 2020s.Japan’s biggest automaker is looking to close the gap with EV leaders such as Nissan Motor Co and Tesla Inc as battery-powered cars gain traction around the globe as a viable emission-free alternative to conventional cars.Whether Toyota will be able to leapfrog its rivals remains to be seen, however, as mass production requires a far more stringent level of quality control and reliability.“There’s a pretty long distance between the lab bench and manufacturing,�� said CLSA auto analyst Christopher Richter. ��2022 is ages away, and a lot can change in the meantime.�� How quickly the new EVs will catch on would also depend largely on battery costs.Having long touted hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids as the most sensible technology to make cars greener, Toyota last year said it wanted to add long-range EVs to its line-up, and set up a new in-house unit, headed by President Akio Toyoda, to develop and market EVs.Toyota is reportedly planning to begin mass-producing EVs in China, the world’s biggest auto market, as early as in 2019, although that model would be based on the existing C-HR sport utility vehicle and use lithium-ion batteries.Other automakers such as BMW are also working on developing all-solid-state batteries, eyeing mass production in the next 10 years.Solid-state batteries use solid electrolytes rather than liquid ones, making them safer than lithium-ion batteries currently on the market.	1.897757196
TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - It’s a long way from Toyota Motor Corp’s U.S. showrooms to Japan’s central bank boardroom, but What Funo will bring a dose of real-world pragmatism to the Bank of Japan.The bank’s latest board nominee probably doesn’t yet have a strong view on monetary policy, say people who know him, but he’s already preparing for the job by reading a book by outspoken former BOJ deputy governor Kazumasa Iwata.What Funo, 68, will bring to the BOJ board, and the debate over its radical monetary experiment, is a realism born from more than four decades at Toyota, including running the world’s biggest automaker’s huge U.S. sales operations.“It’s good to have someone who can do a reality check�� on what the BOJ is doing and how it is communicating policy, said one official familiar with the central bank’s thinking.And what he doesn’t yet know about the technicalities of monetary policy, he’ll be quick to learn. With an MBA from Columbia University and fluent English, Funo defies the stereotype of a risk-averse Japanese businessman, and he’s not shy about asking tough questions, say people who have worked with him at Toyota.“He’s good at discerning what risks you should take and what risks you should avoid,�� said a former Toyota executive.Funo, whose appointment is expected to be rubber-stamped by parliament next month, didn’t respond to a request for comment.Thoughtful and well-read - biographies say he also likes to visit art museums - Funo rose through the Toyota ranks under Hiroshi Okuda, a charismatic former CEO who led an aggressive drive to boost Toyota’s global market share. Belying a professorial public profile, “Yuki�� has been known to bang a fist on the table when faced with incompetence.As head of Toyota’s U.S. sales unit in 2003, Funo set bold sales targets that perplexed some bosses, and didn’t hesitate to take on the Big Three U.S. auto makers on their home turf.Analysts say Funo will tilt the Bank of Japan board’s balance in favor of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, as he succeeds Yoshihisa Morimoto, a former utility executive who was among four dissenters at last October’s surprise monetary easing. Two of the nine BOJ board seats have traditionally been filled by former business executives, though Funo will be the first to come from a consumer products maker.Now an adviser to Toyota, Funo brings a distinctive corporate culture, such as the “Five why’s�� rule that urges employees to ask themselves at least five times why a case has succeeded or failed, before jumping to conclusions.He arrives at the BOJ at a tricky time. The bank missed a two-year timeframe for hitting its 2 percent inflation target as price growth grinds to a halt on falling oil costs and soft consumption. While Kuroda insists the BOJ is ready to top up its asset purchases further, some on the board doubt whether pumping in money more forcefully can accelerate inflation.Some analysts say Funo’s background will see him lean toward policies that help weaken the yen, or at least stem sharp yen gains that hurt manufacturers. Others point to a potential conflict of interest, noting how Toyota pressured policymakers to act when a yen spike hit exporters reeling from supply chain disruptions after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.BOJ officials, however, note that no board member has voted in such a way as to suggest they were serving their company’s interests. Instead, they welcome Funo’s nomination as bringing balance to a board dominated by academics, economists and bureaucrats.“What’s key is that the government didn’t choose another reflationist to fill a BOJ post, and picked someone without a strong view on monetary policy,�� said Masamichi Adachi, senior economist at JPMorgan Securities and a former BOJ official.“It may be the government telling the BOJ it has done enough easing for now, and that it shouldn’t go to extremes.��	-1.280391311
(Adds background)TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has started using batteries that Panasonic Corp designed for Tesla Inc in some of its plug-in hybrids sold in China, the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday.Toyota is using Panasonic’s cylindrical batteries in its new Corolla and Levin plug-in hybrid sedans launched in China this year, the Nikkei said, without citing sources.Toyota, which also uses Panasonic’s prismatic batteries for hybrids, is believed to have ordered about 50,000 of the cylindrical batteries, as the automaker struggles to secure stable supplies of high-quality batteries to meet growing demand, the paper said.A Panasonic spokeswoman said the company was not in a position to comment as a supplier, while Toyota declined to comment.The two companies announced a joint venture in January to build electric-vehicle (EV) batteries, pooling the R&amp;D and manufacturing strengths of one of the world’s largest automakers with one of the largest battery makers.Toyota has also partnered with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) and EV maker BYD Co Ltd for battery procurement to meet the accelerated global shift to electricity-powered cars.Orders from Toyota for cylindrical batteries are boosting Panasonic’s battery plant in Osaka to full capacity, the Nikkei said.Panasonic has been the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, but the U.S. electric vehicle maker is in advanced talks with South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd as it seeks to diversify sources of the key component.	-1.163471389

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday it will move production of its mid-size Tacoma pick-up truck from the United States to Mexico as it adjusts production around North America.The largest Japanese automaker also said it will end production of the Toyota Sequoia in Indiana by 2022 as that facility focuses on mid-size SUVs and minivans.Toyota will shift production of the Sequoia in 2022 to Texas and that plant will end production of the Tacoma by late 2021.Toyota has been building Tacoma trucks at its Baja California plant in Mexico since 2004. Last month, Toyota’s Guanajuato plant began assembly of the Tacoma.Toyota said its production capacity for the Tacoma in Mexico will be about 266,000 per year. Last year, the automaker sold nearly 249,000 Tacoma pickup trucks in the United States, up 1.3%.Toyota said the product moves were to “improve the operational speed, competitiveness and transformation at its North American vehicle assembly plants based on platforms and common architectures.”The new North American trade agreement approved by the U.S. Senate on Thursday ensures that automakers will still be able to build pickup trucks in Mexico without facing new punitive tariffs.In February, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI said it was reversing plans to shift production of heavy-duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, freeing a Michigan facility to produce Jeeps.Toyota said Friday it completed a $1.3 billion modernization investment in its Indiana operations to add 550 jobs. Toyota said there would be no reduction to direct jobs at any of Toyota’s facilities across North America as a result of the vehicle moves.	-2.107037505
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp executives are weighing repositioning Scion as a line of premium small cars as they debate the youth brand’s future in the United States.A decade after its launch as a way to lure younger buyers into Toyota showrooms, Scion is still a work in progress as it looks to rebound from low sales during the recession. The brand is a relatively small seller for Toyota, with its five models selling 73,500 vehicles last year. That compares with Toyota’s four-car Prius line, which sold almost 237,000.The Japanese automaker’s top executives concede that Scion is at a crossroads of sorts.“There’s still debate on where we should go from here,�� Jim Lentz, Toyota’s newly appointed chief executive of North America, told Reuters in a recent interview.“One of the alternatives is we’ve always felt that there’s going to be a big segment created of premium small cars in the U.S.,�� he added. Lentz cited the push by the German luxury brands into lower-cost entries such as the Mercedes-Benz CLA that will sell for less than $30,000.As part of the effort to boost sales, Scion at the New York auto show last week showed off a redesigned tC coupe that will go on sale in late May. However, the brand’s future is already being discussed and options include adding a hybrid vehicle, a crossover or even a four-door sedan.“Any of them could happen,�� Lentz said.Scion’s sales total last year was less than half of its 2006 peak, but far improved from 2010’s nadir of about 46,000 vehicles. Officials expect to sell about 80,000 this year and research firm LMC Automotive forecasts the brand to hit 108,000 in 2020, but company officials insist the brand has never been about the numbers.Introduced as concept vehicles at the New York show in 2002, Scion began selling cars the following year with the idea of appealing to Generation Y buyers who perceived Toyota vehicles as too stodgy. The brand’s buyers are 37 years old, on average - the youngest in the industry - compared with age 50 for Toyota, and 75 percent of Scion buyers are new to the Toyota family, company officials said.What Scion - whose name means “heir�� and which refers to the brand’s cars and owners - stands for remains unclear to many analysts and consumers, however. Some industry analysts were confused last year when Scion introduced the FR-S sports coupe at a higher price than the brand’s other four models.“Toyota still hasn’t found its feet with Scion,�� said Art Spinella, president of research firm CNW Research. “They’re still hunting and pecking around, trying to figure out what the heck the darn thing is.”Lincoln Merrihew, auto analyst with Compete, a unit of WPP Plc’s Kantar Media, said Scion is “at a fork in the road.”Is the brand all about sporty coupes like the tC and FR-S that go in and out of fashion relatively quickly? Or is it quirky, yet functional boxy vehicles like the xB wagon, he said. Scion also sells the xD four-door hatchback and iQ urban minicar.Most Scion vehicles range from about $16,000 to $20,000. The FR-S, which starts at $25,000, is a strange fit in the portfolio for many analysts, some of whom insist the car would be a better fit under the Toyota brand.Rapidly expanding Scion does not seem to be in the cards. “If we could add a sixth, we can probably manage that. I don’t see us doing 10,�� Scion Vice President Doug Murtha said at the New York show.As the market changes, however, so might Scion, Lentz said. That discussion is not new.“The Prius C, quite frankly, could have been a Scion product,�� he said. “We kind of debated which channel makes more sense.�� The car was placed with Toyota in the end because younger buyers favor better audio systems or wheels, and it made more sense financially to market all the Prius vehicles together.Toyota’s mistake with Scion was targeting a young demographic instead of creating a brand that appealed across many demographics with a common psychological pull like BMW’s Mini cars, LMC senior analyst Joe Langley said.“Toyota still needs to develop a more clear identity and direction for the brand,�� he said.	8.89898703
WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - An executive with Panasonic Automotive Systems Corp was indicted on Tuesday on charges that he conspired to fix the prices of steering wheel switches and other parts sold to Toyota Motor Corp for cars sold in the United States, the Justice Department said.The indictments are the latest in a wide-ranging probe into price fixing of a variety of car parts that has ensnared 11 companies and 19 executives. Panasonic agreed in July to pay about a $45.8 million criminal fine in connection with the probe.The European Commission has a parallel investigation under way.Shinichi Kotani, who is Japanese, conspired to fix the prices of turn signal and headlight switches and related devices from January 2004 to at least February 2010, according to the indictment.The parts involved in the Justice Department’s probe have included heater control panels that regulate a car’s temperature, switches for turn signals and wiper blades, power locks, dashboard panel instruments, airbags, steering wheels and seat belts.Among the companies that the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division has settled with are Autoliv, Tokai Rika Co Ltd , TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, Nippon Seiki Co Ltd and Furukawa Electric Co Ltd and Fujikura Ltd.The case is in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, and is No. 13-20700.	-0.8933384675
LE MANS, France (Reuters) - Audi’s Tom Kristensen won the Le Mans 24 Hours for a record ninth time on Sunday in a victory dedicated to fellow-Dane Allan Simonsen, the friend whose death cast a pall over the race’s 90th anniversary.With Danish flags at half-mast over the podium, a standing ovation was held before the victory ceremony in memory of the Aston Martin driver who died after crashing only minutes into the race on Saturday.Kristensen, Denmark’s greatest racing driver, told the crowd he had intended to pay tribute to his father but the first race fatality in 27 years at the Sarthe circuit had forced a change of plan.“He can wait for the next victory of mine,�� he said, voice laden with fatigue and emotion after the final stint to the chequered flag. “This victory today I dedicate to Allan Simonsen, a great fellow Dane.”The muted win, after a race littered with safety car periods on a wet weekend in western France before the sun came out at the finish, was Audi’s fourth in succession and 12th in a dominant 14 years.Kristensen, whose last Le Mans success was with Audi in 2008, shared the number two car with Britain’s Allan McNish - now a three times winner - and local man Loic Duval making his first appearance on the top step.“Three’s a much nicer number than two, especially when it’s at Le Mans,�� said McNish, whose Audi R18 e-tron quattro diesel hybrid had started on pole position.His 45-year-old team mate was already the most successful driver in Le Mans history, having surpassed Jacky Ickx’s tally in 2005. The two greats hugged on the podium in an embrace laden with sadness.Toyota finished as runners-up in the 81st running of the endurance classic with their number eight car driven by France’s Stephane Sarrazin, Britain’s Anthony Davidson and Swiss driver Sebastien Buemi finishing one lap behind the winners.That provided more of a feel good story with Davidson stepping onto the podium a year after he broke his back in a huge crash at Le Mans.“This time last year I was lying on my back in Le Mans hospital,�� he said. “I felt like a needed a bit of luck this time. This race has been so cruel to me so many times.”Davidson also paid tribute to Simonsen, an old rival he first raced against in go-karts in 1996.“It’s very hard, especially with what happened to me last year, to fight my own demons and carry on driving,�� said the Briton. “It’s sad, sad news and it puts everything into perspective.”Audi’s number three car took the final podium place with Spaniard Marc Gene, Britain’s Oliver Jarvis and Brazilian Lucas Di Grassi.Toyota took fourth place while the number one Audi finished fifth, denying a third win in a row for Germany’s Andre Lotterer, Switzerland’s Marcel Fassler and Frenchman Benoit Treluyer.Simonsen’s Aston Martin team had vowed to carry on and win their GTE Am class in a tribute to the 34-year-old and at the request of his grieving family but that was not to be with Porsche taking that honor.“The whole team pushed because they wanted to get the win as a tribute for Allan but a series of small incidents, small accidents, small mistakes and we did not quite achieve it,�� said Aston Martin boss David Richards.The most recent fatality connected with the race was Frenchman Sebastien Enjolras, killed during pre-qualifying in 1997, but the last to die during the race was Austrian Jo Gartner in 1986.Le Mans, the scene of motor racing’s deadliest accident when at least 80 people died and scores more were injured in a 1955 disaster, ranks with Indianapolis and Monaco as one of the sport’s great events.Most of the first hour of the race was behind the safety car before racing renewed in a battle between Audi and Toyota that lasted through the night and into the dawn.The number one Audi suffered a knockout blow at the quarter distance when a problem with the motor generator kept the car in the pits for 43 minutes before it returned to the track in 24th place and 12 laps behind.The number three Audi also hit problems, dropping to fourth place where it remained through the night after limping back to the pits with a right rear puncture and then also requiring repairs in the garage.Through it all, the number two Audi kept out of trouble with neutrals willing Kristensen on for the emotional finale.	11.11301811

(Reuters) - Australia's Fortescue Metals Group FMG.AX said on Monday it had signed a deal with the local unit of Canadian utilities company ATCO Ltd ACOx.TO to build and operate hydrogen refuelling facilities for vehicles in Western Australia. To start with, the two firms will work toward building and operating a combined hydrogen production and refuelling unit at ATCO’s existing facility in Jandakot, Perth, with the possibility of wider deployment across the state.The new unit will include a fleet of Toyota Mirai fuel cell electric vehicles provided by Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Australian unit, the country's third-largest iron ore miner said. “As the world moves toward a lower carbon future, hydrogen has the potential to play a key role in the future energy mix and we want to ensure we remain at the forefront of Australia’s renewable hydrogen industry,�� said Elizabeth Gaines, chief executive officer of Fortescue.	-0.678049179
TOKYO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp unveiled a completely redesigned hydrogen-powered fuel cell sedan on Friday in its latest attempt to revive demand for the niche technology that it hopes will become mainstream.Japan’s biggest automaker has been developing fuel-cell vehicles for more than two decades, but the technology has been eclipsed by the rapid rise of rival battery-powered electric vehicles promoted by the likes of Tesla Inc.Ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show starting on Oct. 24, Toyota unveiled a prototype of the new hydrogen sedan built on the same platform as its luxury Lexus brand’s LS coupe. The new Mirai model boasts longer driving range than its predecessor and completely redesigned fuel cell stack and hydrogen tanks, the company said.“We wanted to make a car that people really want to buy, not just because it’s an eco car,�� Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the new Mirai, said at the unveiling.“We wanted something that’s fun to drive.”Its sporty redesign with longer wheelbase and lower-slung chassis is a marked departure from the first-generation Mirai, which looks like a bulked-up Prius hybrid.The new car also has a 30% improvement in driving range over the previous iteration’s approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles), according to the company.Tanaka said the latest Mirai would cost less to make than its predecessor, because of a shift to mass production. The current model is mostly assembled by hand.Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,500) after subsidies in Japan, the original Mirai is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd leases out the Clarity.Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. By contrast, Tesla sold 25,000 of battery-powered Model S sedans in its first year and a half.Toyota declined to disclose a price for the model and said it would be available from late next year in Japan, North America and Europe.	7.094868955
"(Reuters) - Global automakers kicked off 2017 displaying a wide array of future vehicles at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage.Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14.* Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan 7201.T Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes.* Kia Motors Co 000270.KS Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017.* Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's ""flagship"" model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX.* BMW 5-series. BMW AG BMWG.DE has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept.* Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co 7267.T debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year.* Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co F.N will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine.

Aug 20 (Reuters) - The first mass-production version of the new 2013 model year Honda Motor Co Accord sedan, the most important new vehicle for Honda this year in the U.S. market, rolled off an Ohio assembly line on Monday, the company said.The 2013 Accord will go on sale at U.S. dealerships next month. The 2012 version of the Accord is the second-biggest-selling car in the United States so far this year, behind the Toyota Motor Corp Camry.The Accord has been made at the Honda plant northwest of Columbus, Ohio since 1982, when Honda became the first Japanese automaker with a U.S. plant.Since then, more than 9 million Accord sedans have been made at the plant.	0.04884004884
BERLIN, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Germany’s Volkswagen is hiring Italian engineering graduates as it expands its recruitment efforts in southern Europe to counter a skills shortage at home.Up to 100 young Italian engineers will be trained for as many as 21 months at German affiliates of Europe’s largest automotive group, starting early next year, the company said on Wednesday.The measure follows a programme announced by VW in August 2012 that resulted in 105 young engineers from Spain and Portugal, out of a pool of more than 5,700 applicants, joining as trainees.Youth unemployment is running at more than 40 percent in Italy and is one of the main challenges facing Prime Minister Enrico Letta.Wolfsburg-based VW is offering young Italians the prospect of permanent employment in its efforts to secure the supply of skilled technical staff as it continues its international expansion with new factories in China, Brazil and Mexico.The company, which has set a goal of surpassing Toyota and General Motors to become the worlds�� No. 1 carmaker by 2018, increased its workforce by 3.7 percent to 570,000 in the first nine months of the year.	-0.7811201595
TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it expects its vehicle sales to fall slightly in 2015 in a move that could see rival Volkswagen AG steal the industry crown this year.Toyota said it expects 2015 group-wide global sales to fall about 1 percent to 10.15 million vehicles as demand stalls in emerging markets such as China and Indonesia, as well as in Japan after the country’s sales take hike last year. The figure includes sales at subsidiaries Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd.Toyota expects its parent-only sales to rise 0.4 percent to 9.18 million vehicles, with a 2 percent rise to 7.73 million vehicles overseas and a 7 percent fall to 1.45 million in Japan.In 2014, its group-wide sales grew 3 percent to 10.231 million vehicles.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T raised its full-year net profit forecast on Friday due to improvements in its Chinese operations, while the Japanese automaker also lifted its sales forecast for the North American market, where demand has been booming.The world’s biggest-selling automaker said it expected to post a record net profit of 2.27 trillion yen ($19.43 billion) in the year to March, up slightly from a previous forecast of 2.25 trillion yen, as operating income in Asia picks up due to increased production efficiencies in China.Along with favorable exchange rates in the region, this has lifted earnings even as economic weakness among some Asian countries has resulted in lower vehicle sales.“Our Chinese operations have improved, which has increased our profitability. This is why we’ve raised our profit forecast,�� Managing Officer Tetsuya Otake told a results briefing.Toyota raised its full-year vehicle sales forecast for the North American market to 2.87 million from 2.85 million, as a stable U.S. economy keeps demand strong for its SUVs and pick-up trucks.Japan’s biggest automaker has been enjoying solid growth in the United States, its largest market which posted record annual sales last year as an improving economy and lower gasoline prices have cranked up demand for higher-margin SUVs and pick-up trucks.The automaker sold 10.15 million vehicles globally in calendar 2015, beating out Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, which has seen its sales suffer due to an emissions-cheating scandal, to keep its title as the world's best-selling automaker.While a sharp fall in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar in recent years has boosted profitability, Toyota said its impact has started to subside. For the year, it has set a U.S. dollar rate of 120 yen, compared to a previous forecast of 118 yen.A stabilizing yen against the U.S. dollar following months of deep losses, along with an appreciation in the Japanese currency against the euro and other currencies weighed on the company’s third-quarter operating profit, which fell 5.3 percent from the previous year to 722 billion yen.This was lower than forecasts for 780 billion yen taken from 12 analysts according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.Toyota said domestic vehicle output would likely be impacted by a stoppage in domestic production next week due to a steel shortage following an explosion at a steel plant owned by one of its affiliate companies. The company said it had yet to factor in any possible impact into its earnings.	-1.117932741
BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen will start selling its first plug-in hybrid models next year to sports car lovers as the German automaker plays catch-up with hybrid-vehicle champion Toyota Motor Corp.VW expects growing demand for the fuel-saving technology and will target wealthy buyers with initial launches of plug-in hybrid versions of the Porsche Panamera coupe and the 918 Spyder sports car, VW’s electric car chief Rudolf Krebs told Reuters.“Plug-in hybrids offer the best of the two worlds (of purely electric drives and combustion engines),�� Krebs said. “This technology will soon be visible on the roads. That’s why we really want to get weaving.”Europe’s biggest car maker is a late starter on electric powertrains after arguing for years that clean diesel is a better fuel-efficiency strategy than hybrids, which combine a combustion engine with battery-powered electric propulsion.Toyota, the world’s no. 1 car maker, introduced the Prius hybrid compact vehicle in 1997, 13 years before VW’s Touareg hybrid SUV came to market in 2010, and started delivering a Prius plug-in version this year.Faced with caps on carbon-dioxide emissions in core European markets and a drive by rivals for the most ecological powertrains, VW wants its share of the growing euphoria for plug-in hybrids that can travel longer distances on battery power than ordinary hybrids and can be recharged in public.“This is a long-term trend that can no longer be reversed,�� Krebs said, noting that VW will commit a “considerable�� amount of over 7 billion euros of annual spending on research and development to electric mobility.“The planned offensive on plug-in hybrids will become a core element of our future strategy.”A stronger push by VW into plug-in hybrid technology could also wrongfoot French rival Renault RENA.PA and Japanese affiliate Nissan 7201.T which have staked the most on purely electric cars among major auto companies, investing 4 billion euros in their development and production.Sales projections suggest VW may be backing the right horse.Global production of plug-in hybrids may soar more than eight times to 960,644 vehicles by 2018 from 118,961 in 2013, according to research firm IHS Automotive.By contrast, sales of purely electric cars, shunned for their high prices and limited driving range, may increase fewer than threefold in that period to 627,816, IHS said.VW plans to roll out plug-in hybrid versions of its best selling Golf hatchback in 2014 and the Passat model, flanked by the Audi Q7 SUV, A3 compact and the Porsche Cayenne SUV, according to Krebs. The Audi A6 sedan and A8 flagship model will follow in subsequent years, he added.“We will take this pioneering technology out of its niche and make it accessible to as many customers as possible,�� Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said at the Paris auto show in September.“They’re trying to get a foot into the door because Toyota and other rivals won’t be caught napping,�� said Hanover-based NordLB analyst Frank Schwope. “But it will be a long battle.�� (Editing by David Cowell)	12.66294227
SAN LUIS POTOSI, Mexico (Reuters) - BMW sees no reason to change its plans for Mexico in the wake of U.S. threats to slap duties on Mexican imports, a board member of the German carmaker said on Thursday, adding the company sells cars globally despite tariffs placed by most countries on imported vehicles.The automaker also foresees no immediate change to its investment plans for North America, said Oliver Zipse, BMW board member in charge of production.Zipse was in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi for the inauguration of a $1 billion BMW plant.Still, other automakers have warned that the imposition of punitive duties on Mexican imports could be damaging to the industry, with Toyota Motor Corp saying on Tuesday the proposal could cost its major suppliers $1 billion.Last week, Trump said Mexico must take a harder line on stopping the flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border or face 5% tariffs on all its exports to the United States from June 10, rising to as much as 25% later this year.BMW is producing its 3 series at the San Luis plant, which started up in April and has a capacity of up to 175,000 vehicles per year.The company plans to ship 2,000 vehicles to the United States from the new Mexican plant in April to July.“It will increase our already strong footprint in North America and provide us with further model variety in addition to our big SAV (sports activity vehicle) production plant in Spartanburg,�� said Zipse in prepared remarks.BMW’s SAV is a form of sport utility vehicle (SUV).Asked if BMW will try to lobby U.S. officials to drop the tariffs, Zipse suggested that the company will let its robust presence in the United States do the talking. He noted BMW’s plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is its largest in the world, with 14,000 direct employees.	3.660429774
TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp Managing Officer and Chief Communications Officer Julie Hamp was arrested for a suspected violation of Japanese drug law, Japanese media reported on Thursday, citing Tokyo police.A Toyota spokeswoman said the company was aware of the report and was checking on the facts of the matter.Kyodo News Agency said Hamp, an American, was arrested on suspicion of violating the law by bringing pills containing illegal substances into Japan.Public broadcaster NHK said Hamp had received Oxycodone pain medication in the mail.Hamp, a former General Motors Co executive, was the first woman to join the executive ranks at Toyota when she was appointed to her position in April.A spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police was unable to immediately comment on the report.

DETROIT, July 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd on Friday will unveil its newest-generation Accord, one of four re-engineered midsize sedans that Asian automakers are betting on to win market share as Detroit automakers shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp’s all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda’s U.S. dealers.Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday’s event in Detroit.The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers�� U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co &lt;005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily.“There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment,�� said Jack Hollis, Toyota’s head of marketing for North America.Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.“They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,�� said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc, the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group.“NOT FINDING A PLACE WITH CONSUMERS”The Accord for years was Honda’s top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former.Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J)The new Accord and Camry “may stem the decline,�� said IHS Markit’s Tom Libby. “I don’t think they will cause a marked reverse.”Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said.“As a dealer we can’t ask for much more.��	2.568058076
TOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Tokyo’s Nikkei average surged 4 percent to its highest level in more than four years on Wednesday, after the yen declined sharply on bets that a decision by the head of the Bank of Japan to step down early will bring forward aggressive monetary easing.Hikes in profit forecasts from the likes of Toyota Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Machinery Ltd due to the weaker yen, which inflates the value of earnings garnered overseas, helped sustain the bullish mood.The Nikkei climbed 432.78 points to 11,479.70, its highest level in 52 months and was on track for its biggest one-day percentage rise since March 2011.The yen slumped to 94 yen against the dollar, a low not seen for 33 months.Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Tuesday he would step down together with his two deputies, three weeks before the end of his five-year term.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has put the central bank under relentless pressure to do more to pull the economy out of the doldrums and made it clear that he wants a governor who will be bolder in loosening monetary policy.“It was a very aggressive, solid weakening of the yen to what seems like relatively trivial news, but nonetheless news that signals the expectation and recognition that the momentum is Japan is continuing to favour yen weakening and risk-on mood,�� said Stefan Worrall, director of cash equity sales at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.Toyota jumped 6 percent and was the most-traded stock by turnover on the main board, while Mitsubishi Heavy soared over 12 percent.Shares of companies that will benefit from a return to inflation, which Abe has made clear he wants the BOJ to achieve, were also in the spotlight, with the real estate sector advancing 4.7 percent.The broader Topix jumped 3.4 percent to 971.94.	0.8657587549

TOKYO, April 10 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Aircraft said on Friday it will delay the maiden test flight of Japan’s first commercial jet in half a century, squeezing further an already tight schedule to begin deliveries in two years.The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) will make its first flight by the end of October, the company said in a presentation. The Japanese company had planned to conduct the MRJ’s maiden flight before the end of June. ANA Holdings, it said, is still slated to get the first MRJ in June 2017, three years later than initially planned.The Mitsubishi Heavy Industries subsidiary that includes Toyota Motor Corp as an investor is building the $42-million regional jet, with just under 100 seats. It is aiming to supplant Canada’s Bombardier as the world’s second biggest maker of 100-seat regional jets, behind Brazil’s Embraer.

(Corrects capacity in first paragraph to 270 soccer balls from 465)* Ford creates people-mover version of its Transit Connect* Ford sees passenger van attracting anti-minivan Millenials* “Soccer-mom�� stigma has hurt minivan image, salesBy Deepa SeetharamanDETROIT, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will showcase this month a seven-passenger vehicle aimed at young families that features sliding doors and enough interior space to hold roughly 270 soccer balls.But do not call it a minivan.A people-mover version of Ford’s Transit Connect commercial van will be smaller, more fuel efficient and less expensive than the minivans sold by rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, Ford executives said on Tuesday.Additionally, its design -- with a high roof and squared-off rear -- will not trigger the “soccer mom stigma�� that dogs traditional minivans, particularly among the under-30 set who are beginning to start families, Ford said.“Many of them grew up in the back of a minivan,�� Ford’s head of global engineering Hau Thai-Tang said at a media event.“Historically, different cohort groups tend to reject what they’re familiar with,�� Thai-Tang added. “We think that’s another reason a product like this would be appealing to them.”Ford has been selling the Transit Connect since 2009 as a commercial vehicle with about 35,000 in sales a year. A people-mover version will debut later this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show and will go on sale by the end of next year. The van will be built in Valencia, Spain.U.S. minivan sales peaked in 2000 at just over 1.3 million and today’s sales are about half that. Ford stopped production of its Freestar minivan in 2007, turning its focus to crossovers such as the Flex and the Edge and sport-utility vehicles such as the Escape and the Explorer.Minivan sales have slowed due to a social view that it signals the driver has lost his or her individuality after becoming a parent, analysts and executives say. This distaste is acute among the younger generation known as the Millenials.“It’s not the growth opportunity it once was,�� said Ford marketing manager Tim Stoehr. “The current minivan formula has not evolved to match customers�� changing needs.”Companies have tried to upend this image through styling and marketing. The dominant player in the minivan market, Chrysler Group LLC, launched a sportier version of its Dodge Caravan last year dubbed the “man van�� that featured an all-black interior, wider tires and a stiffer suspension. Caravan sales were up 28 percent through October.In 2010, Toyota launched a popular ad campaign for its Sienna centered around a rapping couple running errands in the suburbs in their “swagger wagon.�� Sienna sales are up 3 percent this year.But the minivans on the market do not offer what customers want in terms of price of fuel economy, Thai-Tang said.“Toyota, Honda and other minivan manufacturers have left today’s customers behind with inefficient people movers that are too large and too expensive,�� he said.The 2013 Sienna starts around $26,400 while the Odyssey starts around $28,500. Ford did not provide the Transit Connect’s price, but said it will cost “thousands less�� than the Toyota and Honda minivans.Ford expects the Transit Connect will get 30 mpg on the highway. It has more than 100 cubic feet of cargo space and will be offered in five- and seven-person configurations with the option of a rear lift-gate or side-hinged cargo doors.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is giving its mainstream Chevrolet Malibu a speedier-than-usual freshening, after sales of the midsize sedan have fallen further behind those of rival cars from Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Ford.The 2014 Malibu, on sale this fall, will get a mildly revised front end, a slightly roomier interior and a more-efficient four-cylinder engine, GM said Friday.The Malibu, one of GM’s best-selling cars, was extensively redesigned in early 2012, when it went on sale as a 2013 model. But a full range of models and engine options was not available until later in the year.A freshening just 18 months after introduction is unusual in an industry where such changes typically occur every three years.In the first four months of 2013, Malibu sales have dropped nearly 12 percent, and the car remains mired in fifth place among midsize sedans in the United States, well behind the segment leaders.Since the 2013 Malibu arrived 16 months ago, three competing cars - Nissan Motor Co Ltd's 7201.T Altima, Ford Motor Co's F.N Fusion and the Honda Accord - have come to market with new designs. Their sales during January through April reflect their edge over the Malibu.Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Camry maintained its class-leading position, although its sales were down nearly 7 percent from a year earlier. Its lead has narrowed against its closest competitor, the new Accord, which Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T introduced last fall and whose sales have climbed more than 26 percent this year.Battling for third place are the Altima, which was revamped last summer and whose sales are down 3 percent, and the Fusion, which received a major overhaul last fall and whose sales are up 25 percent.GM has fought back with a price cut earlier this year on Malibu, as well as heavy discounting.The company’s shares were down 0.4 percent at $34.51 in midday trading.Automakers on Monday will announce U.S. sales results for May.	5.860080888

U.S. safety officials, as well as Takata officials, have said that exposure to humidity over time has been a factor in the erroneous air bag deployments.Seven deaths linked to Takata air bags have occurred in Honda Motor Co cars, six of them in the United States.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hyundai 005380.KS agreed a deal with Audi NSUG.DE on Wednesday to collaborate on hydrogen car technology, hoping to boost an energy segment that has lagged behind battery electric vehicles. The South Korean firm wants to increase the uptake of hydrogen cars, which are propelled by electricity generated by fuel cells but have been held back by a lack of infrastructure and the push for battery electric vehicles by the likes of Tesla TSLA.O. The pair will be able to access each other's intellectual property and share components, including any new parts developed by Audi, which is responsible for hydrogen fuel cell technology in the Volkswagen Group VOWG_p.DE, the world's biggest car seller.Hyundai hopes that the move will create greater demand for vehicles such as its ix35 model and bring down costs to make the technology profitable.“We want to provide to our component suppliers more chance and we want to have competition between component suppliers,�� Sae Hoon Kim, the head of Hyundai’s R&amp;D fuel cell group, told Reuters in an interview in London.“We also want to make them to have competition with other suppliers, and that competition will bring down the cost.”Carmakers such as Toyota have touted the benefits of hydrogen vehicles, which take less time to refuel than the recharge times of battery electric cars, but are expensive and suffer from a lack of refuelling stations.Many carmakers are focusing on battery electric vehicles, which can take between half an hour and half a day to recharge, but are increasingly able to use a growing network of charging points.Auto firms are teaming up to share the cost of developing greener technologies to replace combustion engines as regulators around the world crack down on emissions. GM and Honda have a partnership to jointly develop electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020, while BMW is working with Toyota.Kim said that a toughening of European Union carbon emission limits in 2025 would create a need for more hydrogen cars.Hyundai sold 200 such models last year and expects to sell thousands this year, but Kim said profitability was still far off.��100,000 or 300,000 vehicles per year per company, when that comes, I think we can make money,�� he said.	-0.7010402533
DETROIT, May 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, the top three automakers in the United States, on Tuesday all posted lower new vehicle sales in April in a fresh sign the long boom cycle for the auto industry is losing steam.GM shares fell 3.5 percent while Ford was off 4.5 percent.No. 1 U.S. automaker GM reported a 6 percent decline in April sales to 244,406 vehicles, but said the month continued to see strong growth for crossovers and trucks.Over the past couple of years, U.S. consumers have increasingly shunned cars in favor of larger crossovers, SUVs and trucks.New vehicle sales have risen ever since the end of the Great Recession, hitting a record of 17.55 million units in 2016. But as consumer appetite for new cars has waned, automakers have raised discounts to get vehicles off dealer lots.GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose in the first quarter and that its consumer discounts were equivalent to 11.7 percent of the transaction price. The automaker also said its inventory level had risen to 100 days of supply at the end of April versus around 70 days at the end of 2016.GM has said it will bring inventories down by the end of 2017, but the most recent level has created concern among analysts.Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said sales were down 7.2 percent in April, with sales to consumers down 10.5 percent. Car sales dropped 21 percent and trucks declined 4.2 percent, while SUV sales rose 1.2 percent.Toyota said sales fell 4.4 percent in April, with its luxury Lexus brand posting an 11.1 percent drop.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it would stop making cars and engines in Australia by the end of 2017, marking the end of an era for a once-vibrant auto production base and the loss of thousands of direct and indirect jobs.Toyota's decision follows the planned exits of General Motors GM.N and Ford Motor F.N announced last year and would leave no global automaker remaining in Australia as high costs and a strong currency make it an unattractive production base.“We did everything that we could to transform our business, but the reality is that there are too many factors beyond our control that make it unviable to build cars in Australia,�� Toyota Australia President Max Yasuda said in a statement.About 2,500 jobs will be affected when the plant stops building cars in 2017, the company said.Toyota’s exit from Australia after more than half a century there is a setback to Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s conservative government, which is seeking to manage a slowdown in the $1.5 trillion economy as a decade-long mining investment boom slows.“This is obviously devastating news for everyone involved with Toyota. It’s devastating for me and for the government,�� Abbott said in Canberra.Union leaders were more vocal in their criticism of the government’s handling of the auto industry’s woes.“The loss of the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia will have far reaching consequences around the country and throughout the economy,�� said Australia Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Secretary David Oliver.“They’ve (the government) done absolutely nothing to keep Toyota in this country,�� he added, warning that A$21 billion ($18.80 billion) would be wiped from the economy and that some regions would go into recession.The ACTU groups the main Australian trade unions under an umbrella group.A pullout by Toyota had been widely feared because of the blow to the parts supply base from the flight of GM and Ford.“It’s a huge moment for industry in Australia,�� Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane told reporters in Canberra after Toyota’s announcement.“Toyota have made no requests to us other than express their frustration with the difficulty they were having with the industrial relations process,�� he said, when asked whether Toyota had sought financial assistance or other forms of aid.Australia’s car industry includes about 150 companies working in sectors from components to tooling, design and engineering, with more than 45,000 people employed directly in the car and parts-making sectors, according to government data.While Australians bought a record 1.14 vehicles last year, according to the Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, the proportion made domestically was a record low at barely 10 percent. Toyota was the top-selling brand, holding nearly one-fifth of the market.Vehicle production in Australia has nearly halved in the past decade to just above 200,000 in 2012 from more than 400,000 in 2004. Sales of locally made vehicles have suffered in recent years as a stronger Australian dollar makes imported cars more competitive.In contrast, global automakers have been building new factories and ramping up capacity in countries like Indonesia, where a burgeoning middle class and lower costs make it an increasingly attractive production base.($1 = 1.1170 Australian dollars)	-6.530404546
* Skoda targets upmarket buyers with concept car* Seat to focus on Europe after China export failure* Skoda and Seat to miss 2018 sales targets - IHSGENEVA, March 5 (Reuters) - If Volkswagen wants to beat Toyota to the global autos throne, it can’t afford to take its foot off the gas in mass-market cars.Yet two of its three volume brands continue to cause headaches, with Czech division Skoda trailing ambitious sales targets and Spanish carmaker Seat battling a decade of losses.Lower down the chain, VW is also struggling to hit cost goals for its planned budget car for emerging markets, a VW executive told Reuters on Tuesday.To overcome its low-end woes, the German group is now striking out in a new direction to boost the image and appeal of Skoda and Seat, moving the former back upmarket while refocusing Seat on Europe after a failed China export strategy.The European auto slump caused Skoda deliveries to fall 2 percent last year to 921,000, well short of a 2018 goal of 1.5 million. Sales at Seat were up 11 percent at 355,000, but underutilised capacity served to extend its long run of losses.By contrast French carmaker Renault’s budget models helped it to defy a weak Europe and score significant gains in emerging markets, with a particularly strong showing from its no-frills Dacia brand.Without a turnaround in mass markets for VW, Europe’s No.1 automotive group could struggle to surpass Toyota as the world’s biggest carmaker by 2018. In the nearer term, failure to get to grips with the lower-cost brands is likely to weigh on its share price.“VW needs a compelling presence in volume segments and emerging markets if they’re serious about clinching the top spot and retaining it,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Centre of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.Regardless of whether it surpasses Toyota, VW must succeed in lower-cost categories to remain a force in a volume segment that brings the economies of scale required to meet its profit goals. Skoda and Seat accounted for 13 percent of VW’s 9.7 million record sales last year.The Wolfsburg-based company rejected suggestions that the change of tack may renew past friction between Skoda and Seat and with the core VW division.There is always a risk of toes being stepped on in a group spanning 12 brands and about 300 distinct models. In 2009 Skoda’s Superb estate trumped VW’s equivalent, but more expensive, Passat in quality surveys and offered features that were priced as extras in the Passat. The upscale shift ruffled feathers at VW, resulting in the departure of Skoda’s CEO.“Why should Skoda build only practical cars,�� VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn told Reuters. “However, we must ensure precise distinctions are made between the brands, that the brands interact well and that everyone finds their corner.”Previously positioned as VW’s budget alternative for eastern Europe and Asia, Skoda will target more affluent buyers in future, its CEO said in an interview with Reuters.Skoda flaunted its elegant Vision C concept car at the Geneva auto show this week, its first coupe alluding to a more dynamic styling of future vehicles - the five-door model has enclosed door handles and triangular headlamps.“We never before expressed passion in our products,�� CEO Winfried Vahland said. “It’s like the brand is growing up.”Similarly, Seat is countering its image as the black sheep of the VW group by offering more variants of its Leon model and sharpening its focus on rebounding European markets.Though reducing non-production staff and administration, it’s unclear when the Spanish business will return to profit, CEO Juergen Stackmann told Reuters. Seat has amassed 1.5 billion euros ($2.06 billion) of losses since 2005The brand is now reaching beyond its traditional base of young city dwellers, targeting families and fleet operators with the Leon ST, its first estate. The model has attracted 20,000 orders within weeks, Stackmann said.Seat is also considering building cars in China, he said. Plans by his predecessor to expand to China from Seat’s base in Martorell failed because of high import duties and distribution problems, Stackmann said. Seat sold a dismal 1,100 cars in the world’s biggest market in its first full year there in 2013.Forecasters, however, remain sceptical that VW’s shake-up will have the desired effect.“VW has such a spread of the (volume) market with the likes of Skoda and the VW brand. Seat doesn’t fit right with that portfolio,�� said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for specialist analyst LMC Automotive.Seat deliveries could rise 30 percent to 462,000 cars by 2018, research firm IHS Automotive estimates, still short of Stackmann’s goal of 500,000. Sales at Skoda, meanwhile, could grow by 26 percent to 1.16 million vehicles, the forecaster says, against a target of 1.5 million.“I view myself as a member of a relay team taking part in a marathon run,�� Stackmann said. “It’s a tough business.��	-2.843436546
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota and its dealers are quietly maneuvering to allay risks from periodic eruptions of anti-Japan sentiment in China, even as recent sales data suggest a slow but steady recovery for Japanese automakers since the latest flare-up last year.China sales for Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and other Japanese car makers tumbled after a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo sparked an outbreak of anti-Japanese protests in September last year.Trade and diplomatic ties between Asia’s two biggest economies are prone to sporadic disruptions, a legacy of the lingering bitterness from Japan’s wartime occupation of large parts of northeastern China.As a result, some executives at Toyota’s China unit are considering the merit of focusing its sales effort, at least in the shorter term, on southern China, where anti-Japanese sentiment is historically weaker.In the south, sales of Japanese cars have all but recovered to pre-September levels “as if nothing happened��, a senior Toyota executive in Beijing said.“Our feeling is why spend money to overcome the bias against Japanese products in northern China?�� the executive said.“We could get more bang out of that same money by focusing on southern China where we already have a (relatively) good will towards Toyota and Lexus.”Asked about such a move, a Toyota spokesman said it was focusing on the quality of it products.“The bottom line: the best thing for us as an auto maker to do in China, and in any market for that matter, is to keep making efforts to come up as quickly as possible with the kind of cars consumers deem desirable and want to embrace,�� Toyota’s Beijing-based spokesman, Takanori Yokoi, said.Meanwhile, Zhongsheng Group Holdings Ltd. 0881.HK, one of China's biggest retail-distributors of Toyota and Lexus brand cars, has been trying to cut its reliance on Japanese brands by focusing more on European brands such as Mercedes-Benz and Audi NSUG.DEVOWG_p.DE.The Dalian-based dealer group’s strategy is to up the pace of expansion of dealerships selling European cars, while pausing for a while on Japanese brand store openings.Since last September it has opened two Jaguar Land Rover outlets, and the group’s chairman, Huang Yi, said this week two more Jaguar Land Rover stores were under construction and it was applying for rights to open “a few more��.Since last year, Hong Kong-listed Zhongsheng has also opened two new Audi outlets and another two dealers selling Volvo cars.The moves are aimed in part at addressing the concerns of some investors about “over-exposure�� to Japanese brands, which have caused the company’s share price to trade on a weaker note since last year.“We’re not de-emphasizing Japanese brands; we will continue to stick with them because in the longer-term we believe Japanese brands like Toyota and Lexus give us good profitable business,�� group chairman Huang told Reuters in an interview.Zhongsheng operates a total of 162 stores and is one of China's biggest retail auto distributors. It currently has 48 Toyota and 12 Lexus stores across China and runs Nissan 7201.T and Honda 7267.T stores, among other Japanese brands.Roughly half of its profit comes from selling cars from Toyota and Lexus, where it was expanding until 2011, with the bulk of the rest coming from Mercedes-Benz and other European brands.“What we’re doing, instead, is we’re opening more stores selling European brands, like Jaguar Land Rover and Audi to increase the Euro share in our portfolio of brands,�� Huang said.Sales in China by Japan’s big-three auto makers last month were mixed, reflecting a slow but steady recovery of sales since late last year when volume fell nearly 50 percent year-on-year in some months for some brands.For Japanese auto makers, the best defence might be to reduce their exposure to China and expand business in other fast-growing markets such as Indonesia, India and Brazil.And that is precisely what Toyota appears to be doing, slowing the pace of investment in China while accelerating it elsewhere.Toyota and its group companies pledged late last year to spend an additional $1.2 billion in manufacturing capacity and other capital investments in Indonesia. The firm also said on Monday it plans to beef up its presence in Myanmar, Cambodia and Kenya as part of its broader effort to generate about half of global sales from emerging markets.Within China, the senior Toyota executive said a focus on the south made sense because the company has a major production base in the southern province of Guangdong and sales of its cars have always been strong in the region.Moreover, consumers in southern China tend to take cues in consumption from Hong Kong, which has long shown a preference for Japanese brands and products, the executive said. Toyota is still weighing its strategic options, however, and has not made any definitive moves yet.Toyota had, in fact, been planning a marketing push last year to overcome a bias against Japanese products in the eastern province of Shandong, one of China’s biggest auto-purchasing provinces.The Toyota executive, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject, said the company never implemented the marketing campaign because of anti-Japan demonstrations that swept Shandong and elsewhere.Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight, said a possible shift by Toyota and other Japanese brands to focus their sales and marketing resources on southern China was a “natural strategy�� given their manufacturing presence in Guangdong.Still, “longer term they still have to be a player in northern markets, as provinces such as Shandong and Sichuan are poised to displace Guangdong as China’s biggest auto-purchasing provinces��, Zhang added.	3.384689072
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s automaker labor unions are reducing their demands for pay rises for the next fiscal year from amounts sought the previous year, a move that could hamper the Abe government’s efforts to stoke demand and defeat deflation.The annual “shunto�� wage talks are seen as crucial for the ultimate success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aim to generate virtuous growth led by higher incomes and business investment.The unions�� modest demand underscores Abe’s struggle in pulling Japan out of two decades of deflation and stagnation, with the global stock market rout and yen gains since the start of this year giving firms a perfect excuse to forgo wage hikes.The labor union of auto giant Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, which sets the tone for annual wage talks across Japan, is seeking a 3,000 yen ($26.31) increase in monthly base pay, half of what was sought last year.Labor unions of other car makers followed suit - despite record profits Toyota and some others expect in this business year to March. This is the straight third year in which automaker unions have demanded wage rises, having secured increases in the previous two years.The wage talks wrap up at other major firms in leading industries in mid-March, when companies�� management will make their formal responses.“Taking into account slowing inflation and uncertainty over the economic outlook, we can’t demand bigger rises in base salary just because our company logs record profits,�� Toyota union’s spokesman Yasuyuki Takaki told Reuters.“We should seek higher bonuses when short-term profits rise, rather than base salary, which cannot be unwound in times of a business downturn.”The sticky deflationary mindset of labor unions are what the Bank of Japan is trying to eradicate with its aggressive money printing and last month’s decision to adopt negative interest rates to spur growth.Leading blue-chip companies had consented to Abe’s calls to raise wages since he returned to power in late 2012, agreeing to an average wage hike of 2.19 percent in 2014 and a 2.38 percent raise last year - a 17-year high.In a sign that momentum is fading, Japan’s biggest business lobby, Keidanren, has said wage hikes don’t necessarily have to take the form of a hike in base salary - toning down from the more explicit requests it had made until last year.“Labor unions have not shaken off their deflationary mindset,�� said Hisashi Yamada, chief economist at Japan Research Institute.“If labor unions of top firms lower base pay demand, that may make it harder for small firms to raise wages. If base pay stops rising, that could pave the way for return of deflation.��($1 = 114.0300 yen)	-0.288506282

WELLINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - The number of new cars registered in New Zealand rose 17.3 percent on the previous month in March, figures from the New Zealand Transport Agency showed on Friday.The data showed 6,800 new cars were registered last month, and were 4.6 percent up on the same period last year.Overall, car registrations, new and used, were up 13.1 percent on February, and 11.2 percent up on a year ago.The number of new commercial vehicle registrations rose 25.7 percent on the previous month and were up 34.6 percent from a year earlier.Registrations for Toyota vehicles were the highest for the month, followed by Holden, a unit of General Motors , and Hyundai &gt;.	8.009389671
* Toyota’s first full-year profit in Europe since 2007* Aims to sell 1 mln vehicles in Europe by 2015* Sales of hybrids on the riseGENEVA, March 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will turn a profit in its European automotive business during the current fiscal year for the first time since 2007, a feat the company expects to repeat in fiscal 2013 as new models help seize market share from rivals.“In 2013, we want to sell more than 2012, even if we don’t know yet what the volume will be,�� said Didier Leroy, the head of Toyota’s European operations. “Based on the market share, we can, we will make a profit.”Since 2010, Leroy has spearheaded a restructuring of Toyota’s European business while the automaker faced a safety crisis in the United States and production halts after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.Those cost cuts, which included a 40 percent reduction in headcount at Toyota’s headquarters in Brussels, helped boost its bottom line in Europe during fiscal 2012, which ends this month.The Japanese automaker also is helped by its broad definition of Europe. Toyota counts 56 countries, including Israel and Russia, as part of its European market. By that definition, Toyota sales rose 2 percent last year.Toyota’s car sales in Europe, defined as 27 countries by trade association ACEA, fell 3 percent in 2012.But that is still better than the 8.2 percent decline that the entire auto industry faced in Europe, where the economic slump has caused auto sales to shrink, ACEA data show.Next year, Toyota expects sales and market share gains to be buoyed by new models, higher capacity utilization at its factories and further cost cuts.The automaker sees benefits from the increased popularity of hybrids, which have reached a “tipping point�� in Europe, Karl Schlicht, Toyota’s head of European sales, said during a media roundtable before the opening of the Geneva car show.Toyota expects hybrids to account for at least 17 percent of its sales in Europe in 2013, up from 13 percent in 2012.��(Toyota) is sort of pushing very hard with a renewed product range to make up for lost ground for the last couple of years,�� said Tom De Vleesschauwer, director of long-term planning and sustainability for IHS Automotive. “We do expect they will fight back quite well.”�ALL BETS OFF�� IF EUROPE COLLAPSESDuring the roundtable, Leroy reiterated that the company is aiming to sell 1 million vehicles in Europe by 2015, including Lexus brand cars. But executives also left open the possibility that if the market deteriorates sharply, Toyota would reconsider the sales target.“If we can continue to reduce costs and rationalize, we think we can get there,�� Schlicht told reporters. “Our assumption, though, is if there is a complete collapse in the European market, all bets are off.”To support the goal of 1 million annual vehicle sales, Toyota aims to build in Europe 75 percent of the vehicles it sells in the region, Leroy said. That compares with about 63 percent at present.Toyota is also reshuffling production plans in Europe and expects capacity utilization to increase to 80 percent by the end of the process. Toyota could not immediately describe its current utilization.Analysts said the weak yen is now allowing the company to offer higher incentives on its models, while still maintaining a good profit margin. Leroy said the automaker is enjoying the benefits of the weak yen, but that this is not a long-term strategy.“We don’t want to build our business model on the currency situation,�� Leroy told reporters.	2.255566312

DETROIT (Reuters) - Scion, Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T sagging youth-oriented brand, will not be rejuvenated by fresh models on its U.S. showroom floors anytime soon, a top U.S. Toyota executive said on Thursday.Bob Carter, senior vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, said that while the company’s main Toyota brand is rolling out fresh products this year, the 1,000 U.S. Toyota dealers that also handle Scion will have to wait longer.“We have a very robust and very exciting product cadence coming for Scion, however, it’s further down the pipeline,�� Carter told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.Scion sales through August were down 1.6 percent from a year earlier. At this pace, this year’s Scion sales will be only about 40 percent of that of the brand’s peak year in 2006.Carter would not be specific on the timing of any new product for Scion, saying only that nothing new was coming in the next half year.Carter last month told U.S. Toyota dealers they could drop the Scion brand without penalty.While some analysts said that signaled the beginning of the end of the Scion brand at Toyota, Carter said that was not so.“We are absolutely committed to the brand as our youth strategy going into the future,�� Carter said.Still, he admitted that Scion sales are sagging, and told the dealers that with no new product coming soon, they could without any repercussions devote the showroom space to Toyota-branded products that they now use for Scion.Carter said none of the company’s dealers have said they will drop Scion.Toyota launched the Scion brand in 2003, and it is focused on the North American market.The age of Scion buyers is younger than for that of most other brands sold in the United States. Carter says the average age of a Scion buyer is 32, but Detroit-area research firm Polk, now a part of IHS Automotive, said that average age is 49 years.Tom Libbey of Polk said there are several ways to calculate the age of car buyers. He said Polk tallies from official vehicle registration data. Often, he said, the primary driver of a car may be younger than the person, such as a parent, who registers the vehicle.Scion U.S. sales were 73,505 last year, and its 2013 sales through August were a modest 48,959, which is on pace for less than 70,000 this year. Its peak year for U.S. sales was 2006, at 173,034, when the brand had only three models to sell.Through August, Scion accounted for only 0.3 percent of Toyota’s 1.53 million in U.S. sales, while the premium Lexus brand accounted for 11.1 percent and the Toyota brand 88.9 percent.Scion has five models. The best-selling one so far in 2013 has been the new FR-S sports coupe, which at 13,537 sold in the U.S. market is just slightly more than the tC sedan.The boxy hatchback compact xB is next at 12,740 in U.S. sales through August, followed by the xD hatchback subcompact at 6,257 sold and the iQ minicar has sold only 3,078 this year.Carter said he’s confident that Scion sales will rebound.“It’s just going to take us a little longer to see the growth,�� he said.While Carter would not talk specifically about future product, IHS Automotive has said that it expects an FR-S convertible to join the lineup next year, followed by a new xB in 2016 and a compact crossover in 2017.One of the main reasons Toyota dealers are hanging on to the Scion franchise is that nearly 75 percent of Scion customers are first-time buyers, said Carter, and when they buy a second vehicle, they stay with Scion or move up to Toyota or Lexus.	-0.1672640382
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California state transportation officials failed to repair a highway safety device seriously damaged in a high-speed crash 11 days before a fatal collision in March 2018 involving a Tesla in Autopilot mode, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Monday.In the first crash, the NTSB said the driver of a 2010 Toyota Prius was traveling in excess of 75 miles per hour (121 km per hour) when the car struck a crash attenuator, which is designed to absorb crash forces before a vehicle hits a concrete median barrier. The driver survived with no major injuries.In the second crash 11 days later, the driver of a 2017 Tesla Model X was going 71 mph (114 kph) when he struck the same attenuator on US-101 in Mountain View, California. The front of the Tesla separated from the rear and then collided with two other vehicles. The crash killed the driver of the Tesla, 38-year-old Apple engineer Walter Huang.“The safety benefits of a functioning crash attenuator were demonstrated by the differences between the level of driver injuries in the two March 2018 crashes that took place at this location,�� the NTSB said.The agency is still investigating the crash. Tesla and California did not immediately comment. The NTSB is investigating a number of crashes of Tesla vehicles in which the driver assistance system was in use. The system allows people to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods.The report said that after the March 11 crash the California Highway Patrol did not notify the California Department of Transportation of the damage to the attenuator as required.The NTSB found “systemic problems within the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) that negatively affect the timely repair of traffic safety hardware.”State workers discovered the damaged attenuator on March 20 but no date for replacement of the attenuator was scheduled. It was finally replaced three days after the fatal Tesla crash.The NTSB said in the three years before the Tesla crash, the attenuator was struck at least five times, including one crash that resulted in fatal injuries and was struck again in May 2018.The NTSB previously found problems with Caltrans maintenance after reviewing a 2016 fatal crash involving a motorcoach that collided with an attenuator on US-101 in San Jose. In that case, the NTSB determined the attenuator had been damaged 44 days before the crash.	-0.7259392307
(Adds Honda reaction, paragraph 9)NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors are trying to determine whether Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp misled U.S. regulators about the number of defective air bags it sold to automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Word of the investigation follows a notice on Tuesday from the U.S. auto regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which increased the number of cars potentially affected by defective air bags made by Takata to at least 7.8 million, up from the roughly 4.74 million it announced a day earlier.The NHTSA is conducting its own investigation of whether Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force potentially could spray metal shrapnel at occupants. They have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.The probe has focused on inflators recovered from cars being recalled for repairs in hot and humid regions such as Florida. Takata is cooperating with that investigation along with 10 automakers.The NHTSA has urged owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda Motor Corp, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co Ltd , Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Subaru Co Ltd , Chrysler , Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co vehicles to replace air bags as soon as possible.More than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled since 2008 because of defective Takata air bags.Reuters previously reported that manufacturing problems with Takata’s air bags go beyond what the Tokyo-based company disclosed to the NHTSA about why the devices were at risk of exploding with dangerous force, citing internal company documents.According to Wednesday’s article in The Wall Street Journal, the investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York is in very early stages. The company has not been accused of any wrongdoing.A spokeswoman from the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.A spokesman for Honda said the company was not aware of the investigation.Spokespeople for Takata and Ford could not immediately be reached for comment.A BMW spokesman declined to comment on the possibility, adding that the German automaker is focused on carrying out the recall as fast as possible.Spokespeople for Toyota and Chrysler said they had no information on a possible federal investigation of Takata.Spokesmen for Mazda and Mitsubishi said their companies had not been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice and could not confirm the report.A Nissan spokesman said the automaker had no knowledge of such an investigation and declined further comment.Spokespeople from Subaru and GM declined to comment.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Hefty discounts helped boost November U.S. auto sales 3.7 percent, automakers reported on Thursday, putting the industry within reach of the annual sales record set in 2015.But some analysts worried that near-record high discounts, also called incentives, were artificially inflating demand to extend a sales boom that began after the 2008-09 economic crisis.Auto shopping website and industry consultant TrueCar Inc TRUE.O said profit-eroding discounts rose 13 percent in November from a year earlier.Bob Carter, senior vice president for Toyota Motor Corp’s 7203.T U.S. sales arm, was upbeat nonetheless. “We have a very positive outlook on the U.S. economy over the next three years,�� Carter told Reuters.Annualized November U.S. sales were 17.87 million vehicles, down from 18.25 million a year earlier, industry consultant Autodata Corp said. Trucks and sport utility vehicles accounted for 59 percent of new vehicle sales in November, up from 55 percent a year earlier, Autodata said.WardsAuto, which provides data used by the U.S. government for economic analysis, said annualized sales were 17.75 million vehicles, from 17.96 million in November 2015.The two consultancies differ on the number of large trucks they include in the “light vehicle�� sales figures they report.Two more selling days last month made comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match.Each month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending.“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy including consumer and business sentiment, which continue to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry,�� said Mustafa Mohatarem, General Motor Co's GM.N chief economist.“We believe the U.S. auto industry is well-positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.”Brian Johnson of Barclays said an expected rise in interest rates and a tightening of easy credit may pressure sales in 2017. But he said a stronger economy may lead to “a continued plateau�� for sales, rather than the “eroding plateau�� Barclays now forecasts.Robust November sales helped drive up automaker and auto dealer shares. Closing prices Thursday showed GM up 5.5 percent, Ford up 3.9 percent, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc AN.N up 3.7 percent. Market leader GM’s sales rose 10.2 percent to 252,644 new vehicles in November.GM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars.J.D. Power data provided to Reuters showed that GM spent big on those truck sales. Discounts rose to an average of $5,752 per truck sold at GM, up 46 percent from a year ago.That compared with a rise of 5 percent to an average $4,467 at Ford, and a 19 percent increase to an average of $6,6062 per Ram truck sold by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MIFCAU.N.Those figures include heavy duty as well as the most prevalent trucks, which are the F-150 from Ford, the Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 at GM and the Ram 1500.Ford U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said on a conference call that even though oil prices may be on the way to $60 per barrel after OPEC cut production quotas, consumers will still favor SUVs and pickup trucks.Fiat Chrysler’s sales ran counter to the trend, dropping 14 percent.Toyota outsold Ford by fewer than 100 vehicles.

NEW DELHI, July 23 (Reuters) - The India unit of Honda Motor Co Ltd will account for 25 percent of the Japanese carmaker’s Asia Pacific sales target of 1.2 million units by March 2017, Managing Officer Yoshiyuki Matsumoto said on Wednesday.Honda plans to raise the number of dealers in India to 230 by March 2015 from 179 now, said Hironori Kanayama, president and chief executive officer, Honda Cars India Ltd.On Wednesday, Honda launched a seven-seater multi-purpose vehicle, Mobilio, that will compete with similar vehicles from Maruti Suzuki, Toyota Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co, among others.The ex-showroom price for the base grade petrol version of the new car in Delhi will be 649,000 rupees ($10,800), said Jnaneswar Sen, senior vice president, marketing and sales at Honda Cars India Ltd.Honda’s entry-level compact sedan Amaze and its top-selling sedan City have increased the company’s sales in India by 40 percent to 40,516 units in the April-June quarter from the year-ago period, according to industry data.	-3.777852237
* Auto industry around 11 percent of Thai economy* Thailand enjoys big advantage in supplier base, skilled workers* Thousands of auto workers have been laid off due to slowdown* Big car makers have cut production or slowed expansion plans* Japanese manufacturers looking a Indonesia, India in longer termBy Khettiya JittapongCHONBURI, Thailand, May 29 (Reuters) - Thailand’s second military coup in a decade will not scare off foreign car firms, who still prize its skilled labour force and network of parts suppliers, but expansion plans are on hold after months of unrest as Indonesia lures some investment away.The auto industry accounts for about 11 percent of Southeast Asia’s second largest economy, and most of the big global players use the country as a regional hub.“That will not change,�� said Takao Katagiri, Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s regional chief. “There is a strong foundation there including the supplier network. That’s not something that can be changed so easily.”In the short term, the turmoil that prompted the army to seize power in a bid to end seven months of sometimes violent street protests has not changed much for the big car makers, who are likely to export around half the cars they make in Thailand this year.“What is happening now has not had a direct impact on actual livelihoods and corporate activities. Manufacturing is operating smoothly and our sales and business operations are going on as usual today,�� Katagiri said.Smaller players in the supply chain are suffering more, due to the damage the unrest has inflicted on domestic demand. Auto parts maker Aapico Hitech Plc said on Thursday its 2014 revenue would fall 10-15 percent, worse than earlier forecast.At the sprawling Amata Nakorn industrial estate at Chonburi, 60 km east of Bangkok, 30-year-old Rungsan Seagproa said he had suffered a drop in his 19,000 baht-a-month ($580) salary after the auto parts supplier he works for cut back on production.“The factory is running at around 30-40 percent,�� said the assembly worker. “I lost about a few thousand baht after the company cut the overtime shift. Now, I need to be careful about spending.”At least 30,000 subcontracted workers in the auto sector have been laid off because of the slowdown this year.“COUP BEATS DYSFUNCTIONAL GOVERNMENT”Scores of politicians were detained for a while after the coup and censorship imposed, but some Thais welcomed the relative calm and the return of functioning government. One Toyota executive familiar with the country agreed.“We’ll take an orderly coup d’etat any time over a highly dysfunctional democracy that led to a gap in political leadership in Thailand over the past six months,�� he said.Car industry executives say the mood in Thailand was morose even before the coup.Domestic vehicle sales had surged a heady 80 percent in 2012 to 1.44 million vehicles, fuelled by a state subsidy for first-time car buyers that was part of government efforts to boost the economy after floods devastated great swathes of Thailand in 2011, including huge industrial parks in the central provinces.That couldn’t last, and sales fell nearly 8 percent to 1.33 million in 2013, according to the Federation of Thai Industries. Toyota Motor Corp has forecast a further drop of 14 percent this year as political turmoil has pushed consumer confidence to a 12-year low.It is not just the auto industry that is suffering because of the unrest. Figures on Wednesday showed factory output was lower than a year before for the 13th consecutive month in April and capacity utilisation in industry stood at just 56.6 percent, the lowest since the peak of the flooding in December 2011.Imports were 14.5 percent lower than a year before as the domestic economy stagnated and exports continued to struggle, down 0.9 percent compared with April 2013.Thailand’s car sector is suffering from longer-term problems, too, including a shortage of labour and wages that are higher than elsewhere in the region.Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association head Fumihiko Ike, who is chairman of Honda Motor Co Ltd, said car makers were starting to look at Indonesia and India, both of which have vast long-term growth potential.Indonesia is a second Southeast Asian hub for Toyota Motor, the world’s biggest car maker, but it can’t match Thailand as a manufacturing base, an Indonesian-based Toyota executive said.“In terms of parts supply infrastructure and human resources, Indonesia isn’t that sophisticated as yet and cannot compete well with Thailand as a place to operate all aspects of the business, from product development to manufacturing to sales and marketing,�� he said.Shingo Ikeda, a Singapore-based expert on Southeast Asia’s automotive industry with Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, said, judged by the number of parts suppliers, Thailand’s auto industry was around three times the size of Indonesia’s, which he reckoned would take around a decade to catch up.“It’s very hard to switch investment from Thailand to Indonesia,�� Ikeda said. “As an automotive hub in Southeast Asia in the shorter term Thailand is very, very strong because of this huge supplier base.”Thailand’s Hemaraj Land Development Pcl has attracted the likes of Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co plus many parts firms to its five industrial states.“Infrastructure like power, communications, ports, other than road bottlenecks, are very good. There is an excellent automotive supplier base, labour and production costs are reasonable, and the ease of business is favourable in Thailand,�� said David Nardone, its managing director.To be sure, Japanese firms have pulled in their horns in Thailand, and politics has been a factor.Honda said on May 22, hours before the coup, that it had cut output at one plant to 60 percent of capacity. It is delaying the start-up of a new plant by up to a year from April 2015, according to company officials in Thailand, but may reconsider if demand picks up.Toyota said back in January it could reconsider planned investment of up to 20 billion baht ($609 million) in Thailand or even cut production if political unrest dragged on.But the Japanese car makers have been in Thailand for decades and have already invested heavily in manufacturing capacity in the country that cannot be easily shifted.“We don’t have any plans right now to expand capacity over and above that which is already built. So we don’t have any difficult decisions to make,�� said Andy Palmer, chief planning officer at Nissan, which is opening a second Thai plant soon.“If this was happening two years ago, that might be a different situation. One might pause and think, but right now we are already pregnant. The baby is coming whether you like it or not.�� ($1 = 32.7100 Thai Baht) (Additional reporting by Yoko Kubota and Maki Shiraki in Tokyo and Yokosuka, Japan and Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing; Writing by Alan Raybould; Editing by Alex Richardson)	5.790823093
BEIJING, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to “gradually�� restart from Thursday its manufacturing operations near the Chinese port of Tianjin, which has been halted after the deadly chemical explosions on Aug. 12, the company said on Wednesday.“From tomorrow (August 27), we will be gradually restarting production (at the affected plants in Tianjin). We will continue to prioritize safety above everything else, and will proceed with caution while monitoring the situation,�� according to a statement the company issued.Toyota halted operations at two assembly factories in Tianjin in the aftermath of the Aug. 12 explosions in part because of what the company described as safety hazards from the blasts.Two huge explosions tore through a warehouse storing dangerous chemicals in the northeastern city on Aug. 12, killing at least 116 people and sending shockwaves through apartment blocks kilometers away.Authorities there were slow to release a list of the chemicals being stored, which included 1,300 tonnes of potentially explosive oxidizing chemicals.Firefighters initially fought the blaze with water, which experts said may have combined with the chemicals to form an explosive gas.

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chinese carmakers are involved in a slow-motion wreck. Falling sales hit Geely Automobile Holdings and Great Wall Motor harder in the first half than rivals partnered with foreign marques. Both companies have started seeking JVs, too. A better route to recovery would be industry consolidation, and soon.Domestic manufacturers are getting crunched from every direction. The withdrawal of government incentives last year caused customers to accelerate their purchases. Geely, whose parent company owns Volvo, blamed new emissions standards for its aggressive price cuts, and by extension a 40% fall in profit through the end of June. The bottom line at $9 billion SUV maker Great Wall shrank 60% for similar reasons. Beijing is also now slashing subsidies for electric vehicles, putting even more pressure on margins.Some sympathy might be expected from the central government, which considers autos a “pillar�� industry. Yet Beijing is also aware the country has far too many car companies, and that too many of them rely too heavily on shared revenue from overseas JVs, which has crippled their export competitiveness. Sales of BMW models, for example, made up 90% of revenue at $5 billion Brilliance China Automotive, whose profit fell just 9% in the first half; Guangzhou-based GAC relies on its relationship with Toyota to compensate for slackening demand for its unfortunately named Trumpchi sedan.Local manufacturers are losing market share at home. It was down to 36% in July, after they ceded 3.9 percentage points from a year earlier. Even Geely and Great Wall, which had found some market traction for their own models, have started flirting with overseas rivals. The better ones, however, are mostly taken.Domestic mergers make more sense. Geely and Great Wall are up against mordant state-backed giants such as FAW, along with dozens of smaller rivals and hundreds of EV startups. Local officials stubbornly prop up weak manufacturers to preserve employment, which keeps them running but weak. The long-expected combination of FAW with Dongfeng and Changan, for example, has yet to happen. It’s time to start revving up these sorts of deals.	6.024835199
TOKYO, March 6 (Reuters) - Japanese shares dropped to a six-month low on Friday, racking up their fourth consecutive week of decline, as worries deepened over the economic damage from the coronavirus that is spreading rapidly at home and abroad.The Nikkei share average dropped 2.72% to 20,749.75 the lowest close since Sept. 4, 2019. The broader Topix lost 2.92% to 1,471.46, the lowest finish since January last year.With investors selling a broad range of shares, 97% of shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board were in the red, as the epidemic spread further in Europe and the United States, while Japan struggled to curb cases at home.Even rising speculation of more monetary easing around the world this month, including in Japan and the United States, has so far failed to lift the mood.“The Fed’s fast responses will be applauded in the long run. But in the near term, even if it cuts rates, it won’t stop the virus. Markets are hoping for more measures such as tax cuts and steps to support funding for cash-strapped firms,�� said Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at State Street Bank in Tokyo.SoftBank Group, which owns highly-leveraged tech start-up Vision Fund, lost 6.1%.Tourism stocks took a hit after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered a two-week quarantine for visitors from China and South Korea.H.I.S. dropped 6.3%, AirTrip fell 8.2%, and KNT-CT Holdings shed 3.8%.Domestic demand-oriented shares that have attracted investors with relatively robust earnings prospects succumbed to profit-taking.Central Japan Railway fell 4.5% and Recruit Holdings 3.3%.Exporters were dented as the yen strengthened to a six-month high.Honda Motor lost 4.3% and Toyota Motor was down 3.1%. Komatsu lost 3.6% while Canon dropped 3.5%.The financial sector was hurt by plunging U.S. bond yields, which are an important source of interest income amid negative interest rates at home.MUFG, SMFG and Mizuho Holding fell 3.7%, 4.0% and 3.5%, respectively.The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield sank to a record low of 0.808%.Internet firm Rakuten lost 6.0% after it abandoned a plan to impose free shipping for all retailers that use its e-commerce site.Japan’s fair competition watchdog has recommended a court order on the company to halt the plan following complaints the firm is abusing its dominant position.Bucking the trend, Seven &amp; i Holdings rose 5.9% after the retailer dropped a bid for Marathon Petroleum Corp’s Speedway gas stations in the U.S. after balking at the price, as the market was concerned that the purchase would be costly.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T needs clarity on the terms of Britain's access to European Union markets after Brexit to secure production at its Burnaston plant in central England, it said on Wednesday.The Japanese carmaker’s comments echo calls from businesses in both Britain and abroad for the UK government to make progress in talks on future relations with the EU following the country’s planned departure from the bloc in March 2019.“We cannot stay in this kind of fog when we don’t know what will be the output of the negotiations,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said at the Tokyo Motor Show.“The quicker we can get clarity about that, the better it will be (for) the way we can prepare for the future.”Toyota, which employs more than 3,000 people in Britain, builds the Auris hatchback and the family Avensis car at Burnaston.Sources told Reuters this month the company would build the next Auris model at the plant assuming Britain secured a transitional deal with the EU.Toyota said in March it would invest 240 million pounds ($317 million) in the plant, but retaining tariff-free access to the EU’s single market was crucial.Leroy reiterated on Wednesday this was “absolutely key��.“Today (Burnaston) exports 80-85 percent of production to the European continent,�� he said.“If we move to something like import tax or trade tax or any kind of additional penalty, it will create a big negative impact in terms of competitiveness (...) and if competitiveness is not secured, we have to think about what we will do for the future.”He said Brexit talks, currently deadlocked over the divorce bill, needed to move on to future trading relations.“If the negotiations are postponed and postponed again, it’s clear that it creates some things that are not good for us,�� he said.Asked about Toyota’s concerns, Britain’s finance minister Philip Hammond said he was confident the government would be able to satisfy businesses�� need for certainty.“I think that we stand a very good chance of being able to agree a transition deal with the European Union shortly after the December council,�� he told reporters.“I can’t tell you exactly when it will be, but I think we can expect to make good progress to agreeing a transition deal and to seeing the shape of an end-deal emerging as a political agreement as we go through this process.”Britain said on Wednesday it wanted an outline agreement on a transitional deal by the first quarter of 2018.It is seeking a two-year implementation period after March 2019, during which its access to the EU single market would stay largely unchanged while new arrangements are put in place.There were signs of a potential breakthrough in Brexit talks last week when EU leaders said they would begin preparations to move into “phase two�� in December, a step that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.($1 = 0.7579 pounds)	1.719822366
(Reuters) - At least two dozen civil lawsuits accusing Volkswagen of misleading customers by designing some diesel models to cheat on U.S. emissions tests should be sent to California federal court, a lawyer in one such case said in a motion filed Wednesday.The motion seeks to consolidate Volkswagen litigation before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in the Central District of California. That court has been home to litigation accusing Toyota Motor Corp of concealing a defect that caused cars to accelerate suddenly, as well as cases accusing Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors of overstating certain vehicles�� fuel-economy ratings.Toyota agreed in 2012 to pay $1.1 billion to resolve acceleration class actions, and Hyundai and Kia won approval last year for a settlement valued by plaintiffs�� lawyers at more than $255 million.Since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced last Friday that some of Volkswagen’s diesel cars used software to deceive regulators measuring toxic emissions, at least 25 proposed class actions have been filed in seven states. The cases accuse the carmaker of duping customers into paying a premium for cars they falsely believed to be fuel efficient and compliant with environmental regulations.Volkswagen has said that 11 million vehicles worldwide could be affected, including nearly 500,000 in the U.S. The automaker’s chief executive Martin Winterkorn on Wednesday quit as a result of the scandal.The lawyer who filed Wednesday’s motion, David Vendler, said hundreds of additional cases could potentially to be filed, given the publicity surrounding Volkswagen’s admission and the number of affected customers. “It makes sense to get these cases in one forum as quickly as possible,�� he said. “Otherwise it’s like herding cats.”Vendler is an attorney with law firm Morris Polich &amp; Purdy in Los Angeles. He has filed a proposed class action against Volkswagen in the Central District of California.It is typical for large-scale litigation involving nearly identical claims to be consolidated, although the questions of before which judge and which court can be hotly contested as plaintiffs�� and defense lawyers jockey for advantage. The requests are decided by the seven-judge U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, which holds hearings every two months on such motions.A spokeswoman for Volkswagen declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.	6.61846023
BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will build additional capacity at its auto plant in China's Guangzhou, a company source said, in addition to beefing up production at a factory in Tianjin city by 120,000 vehicles a year.A person close to the company said Toyota will build capacity at the production hub in the south China city of Guangzhou to also produce an additional 120,000 vehicles a year, an increase of 24 percent over current capacity.All together, between the eastern port city of Tianjin and Guangzhou, Toyota will boost its overall manufacturing capacity by 240,000 vehicles a year, or by about 20 percent.Toyota’s production capacity in China is 1.16 million vehicles a year.Reuters reported earlier this week that Toyota plans to build additional capacity in Tianjin to produce 10,000 all-electric battery cars and 110,000 plug-in hybrid electric cars a year.China has said it would remove foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018, for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020, and the wider car market by 2022. Beijing also has been pushing automakers to produce and sell more electric vehicles through purchase subsidies and production quotas for such green cars.Toyota’s planned additional capacity in Guangzhou is also for electrified vehicles, said the company source, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the matter.The source did not say how much the additional capacity would cost. The Tianjin expansion is likely to cost $257 million, according to a government website.The planned capacity expansions in Guangzhou and Tianjin are part of a medium-term strategy of the Japanese automaker that aims to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, a jump of over 50 percent, by the early 2020s, according to four company insiders with knowledge of the matter.The plans signal Toyota’s willingness to start adding significant manufacturing capacity in China with the possibility of one or two new assembly plants in the world’s biggest auto market, the sources said.Car imports could also increase, they said.In addition to boosting manufacturing capacity, Toyota also plans to significantly expand its sales networks and focus more on electric car technologies as part of the strategy, the sources said, declining to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.	-0.6408696358

TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd trimmed its annual net profit forecast by 1.3 percent to 370 billion yen after car sales have been knocked in China, and as it continues to struggle in Europe.Japan’s third-biggest automaker said its net profit for October-December was 77.4 billion yen ($849.94 million), compared with the 47.7 billion yen it booked last year when it suffered from disrupted supply chains after floods hit it and its suppliers�� factories in Thailand.The result was below the average estimate of 111.4 billion yen among seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Honda is the first among major Japanese automakers to announce its third quarter earnings. Toyota Motor Corp is set to announce on Feb. 5, and Nissan Motor Co Ltd on Feb. 8.In the final quarter they will be helped by the yen’s recent weakening against the dollar, as they can convert overseas profits back to the yen at a more favourable rate and export cars more cheaply.Among Japan’s top three carmakers Honda relies most heavily on the United States, which accounts for some 40 percent of its vehicle sales by volume. For rivals Toyota and Nissan, the U.S. accounts for about a quarter of global auto sales.In calendar year 2012 the U.S. auto market posted its strongest sales figures since 2007 at 14.5 million vehicles, up 13 percent from 2011, and the momentum is likely to continue into January as well.The yen’s value eased 11 percent versus the dollar between October and December, trading at around 86.7 to the dollar by the end of the quarter from 78 at the start. Since then it has weakened further to around 91 to the dollar. (Reporting by Yoko Kubota; Editing by Daniel Magnowski and Jeremy Laurence)	7.413232673
LE MANS, France, June 18 (Reuters) - Porsche won the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the third year in a row on Sunday after a race of retirements that scuppered Toyota’s bid for a first triumph.The German manufacturer’s 19th outright win at the Circuit de la Sarthe followed a night of drama with Toyota’s top two cars retiring and the number one Porsche also suffering a terminal problem while leading with four hours to go.That left the number two Porsche, shared by German Timo Bernhard and New Zealanders Brendon Hartley and Earl Bamber, to move surprisingly back into contention and take the chequered flag with Bernhard at the wheel.The trio’s chances had been written off by team bosses on Saturday evening when their car suffered front axle problems and spent 90 minutes in the garage before rejoining at the back of the field and some 22 laps adrift of the leading Toyota.

Mexican driver Suarez breaks through at MichiganBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeBROOKLYN, Mich. -- Daniel Suarez was speechless -- and justifiably so.The Mexican driver had just passed Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch for the lead on the next-to-last lap and held on to win Saturday’s Menards 250 presented by Valvoline NASCAR XFINITY Series race at Michigan International Speedway by .280 seconds over the man who sets the standard in the series.The first Mexican-born driver to win a NASCAR national series race, Suarez overcame a pit road speeding penalty assessed on Lap 29 of 125 under the first of three cautions. He restarted eighth after the third caution on Lap 91, caught and passed Elliott Sadler for second place with 10 laps left and ran down Busch for the lead on Lap 124.“I just have no words,�� said Suarez, an alumnus of NASCAR’s Drive for Diversity and NASCAR Next programs. “I don’t think I can speak English or Spanish right now. I have no words for what I’m feeling right now.“This machine is unbelievable. It’s unbelievably fast -- definitely the fastest car out there. I have no words to describe what I’m feeling right now. It’s just unbelievable.”Though Suarez was reveling in the moment, he made special mention of JGR teammate and fourth-place finisher Erik Jones, whose father passed away at age 53 on Tuesday after a brief battle with cancer. Erik’s No. 20 Toyota carried the name of his father, Dave Jones, painted above the window of his car.“I would like to dedicate this victory to Erik and his family,�� Suarez said.Behind Suarez and Busch, Paul Menard finished third, followed by Jones and Sadler.In passing Busch for the win, Suarez beat the best. Busch holds the XFINITY Series record for victories with 80. And Busch has been a willing mentor to Suarez, who also drives a limited schedule for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.“The Kyle Busch School of Charm finished 1-2-4 today, so not too bad,�� said Busch, who led 88 laps. “Obviously we want to win. We thought we should have won. We had the best car for the majority of the race there, but not the last 20 laps or so -- just got really loose on me.“But congratulations to Daniel Suarez. He earned that one. It’s cool to see. It’s a little bittersweet to lose like that, but it’s all right. It’s one of my students. So the student beat the teacher today.”The speeding penalty wasn’t the only obstacle Suarez had to overcome. As he was working his way back to the front after the infraction, the clutch in his No. 19 Toyota failed, causing the car to stall during a green-flag pit stop on Lap 71.“In the second half of the race, the clutch was gone,�� said Suarez, who increased his lead in the series standings to 18 points over Sadler.Fortunately for Suarez, the clutch wasn’t an issue over the final 33 laps as he chased and ultimately overtook Busch.“He made a statement today that he’s the real deal,�� said Dale Earnhardt Jr., who served as a guest commentator on the Fox Sports 1 broadcast. “I think a lot of people knew that, but if they didn’t, they found out today.”NASCAR XFINITY Series Race: Menards 250 presented by ValvolineMichigan International SpeedwayBrooklyn, MichiganSaturday, June 11, 20161.

(Adds details on settlement, background on auto parts probe)WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former executive of Japan’s Toyoda Gosei Co Ltd has agreed to plead guilty to price fixing and rigging bids for auto parts made for cars sold in the United States, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.As part of the deal, Japanese national Makoto Horie agreed to serve one year and a day in prison and to pay a criminal fine of $20,000, the department said.The Justice Department, along with antitrust enforcers worldwide, have been investigating price fixing of more than 30 car parts, including seat belts, air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components.Toyoda Gosei is among 32 companies that have pleaded guilty to fixing the prices of dozens of car parts. With Horie’s plea deal, a total of 49 executives have been charged or have pleaded guilty to price fixing.Horie, a former Toyoda Gosei sales executive in Japan and at a Michigan subsidiary, has agreed to plead guilty to fixing the prices of automotive hoses that were sold to Toyota Motor Corp or its affiliates, the department said.Horie could not be reached for comment.The case is in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. It is United States v. Makoto Horie, No. 15-003.	3.515219302
(Corrects paragraph 2, bullet point to say operating profit nearly eight times year-ago figure, not more than six times)* Japan No.3 automaker’s op profit 8 times year-ago result* Honda sticks with full-year profit forecasts* Revamped Accord for N.America later this year key to salesTOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co’s operating profit rose less than expected in the April-June period to 176 billion yen ($2.25 billion), as a strong yen eroded some of the gains from its sales recovery in North America, its biggest and most profitable market.While the result was below the average estimate of 197.4 billion yen by seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, it was nearly eight times the year-ago figure, as the company rebounded after last year’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami.Japan’s No.3 automaker on Tuesday also kept its operating profit forecast unchanged for the year ending in March 2013 at 620 billion yen, confident of its recovery despite a global economic outlook clouded by the euro-zone debt crisis and a slowdown in China, the world’s biggest auto market.The maker of Accord sedans and Super Cub motorcycles was hit much harder than rivals Nissan Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp in the last financial year by natural disasters in Japan and Thailand that disrupted supply chains.It has set an aggressive global sales target of 4.3 million vehicles in the financial year to March 2013, up 38.4 percent from the previous year, with North America to account for about 40 percent of the total.Toyota, which announces earnings on Friday, is set to raise its 2012 global sales target to 8.8 million vehicles from 8.58 million, Japanese media reported on Tuesday, while auto parts maker Denso Corp boosted its half-year operating profit forecast by 50 percent to 135 billion yen as the sector’s outlook improves.Honda’s market share has recovered to pre-quake levels in its two biggest markets in the United States and Japan, where sales volumes surged in May and June as the company’s restored production base finally caught up with pent-up demand.Whether Honda can achieve its ambitious sales target will depend in part on how its flagship Accord sedan is received in the U.S. market after a revamp this fall with a new generation of engines and transmissions to boost fuel efficiency.But competition has heated up, especially from a resurgent U.S. industry and emerging South Korean rivals.“There are too many models in a segment that used to be dominated by Japanese brands,�� Kunihiko Shiohara, managing director at Credit Suisse in Tokyo, said before the announcement.Japan’s exporters have also got little respite from the steady rise in the yen, which reduces their competitiveness against South Korean automakers and other overseas rivals, and eats into income earned abroad when it is converted into yen.Shares in Honda have fallen nearly 20 percent in the financial year that began in April, the biggest drop among the top three Japanese carmakers. Before the earnings announcement on Tuesday, Honda shares ended at 2,551 yen, up 2.1 percent, versus a 0.7 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei 225 average .

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s ambitious plan to push electric vehicles at the expense of other technologies could benefit Chinese car makers seeking to enter the market, but is worrying established automakers in the country who have so far focused on making hybrid models.India’s most influential government think-tank unveiled a policy blueprint this month aimed at electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032, in a move that is catching the attention of car makers that are already investing in electric technology in China such as BYD and SAIC.The May 12 report by Niti Aayog, the planning body headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recommends lower taxes and loan interest rates on electric vehicles while capping sales of petrol and diesel cars, seen as a radical shift in policy.India also plans to impose higher taxes on hybrid vehicles compared with electric, under a new unified tax regime set to come into effect from July 1, upsetting car makers like Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor.The prospect of India aggressively promoting electric vehicles was a “big opportunity��, a source close to SAIC, China’s biggest automaker, told Reuters.“For a newcomer, this is a good chance to establish a modern, innovative brand image,�� the source said, although they added the company would need more clarity on policy before deciding whether to launch electric vehicles in India.Earlier this year SAIC set up a local unit called MG Motor which is finalising plans to buy a car manufacturing plant in western India. A spokesman at SAIC did not comment specifically on the company’s India plans.Warren Buffett-backed BYD already builds electric buses in the country, while rival Chongqing Changan has said it may enter India by 2020.BYD said in a statement the company would have “a lot more confidence�� to engage in the Indian market if the government supported the proposed policy. The company said it would look at increasing its investment in India but did not give details on how it would expand its business and market share.While the Niti Aayog report has not yet been formally adopted, government sources have said it was likely to form the basis of a new green cars policy.If so, India would be following similar moves by China, which has been aggressively pushing clean vehicle technologies. But emulating China’s success could be tough.Electric vehicles are expensive due to high battery costs, and car makers say a lack of charging stations in India could make the whole proposition unviable.The proposed policy focuses on electric vehicles, and is likely to also include plug-in hybrids. But it overlooks conventional hybrid models already sold in India, such as Toyota’s Camry sedan, Honda Motor’s Accord sedan and so-called mild hybrids built by Maruti Suzuki.Hybrids combine fossil fuel and electric power, with mild hybrids making less use of the latter.In doubling down on electric power India would be shifting away from its previous policy, announced in 2015, that supported hybrid and electric technology.That could delay investments in India, expected to be the world’s third-largest passenger car market within the next decade, according to industry executives and analysts.“All these policy changes will affect future products and investments,�� said Puneet Gupta, South Asia manager at consultant IHS Markit, adding that most car makers would need to rethink product launches, especially of hybrids.Mahindra &amp; Mahindra is the only electric car maker in India but has struggled to ramp up sales, blaming low buyer interest and insufficient infrastructure.Pawan Goenka, managing director at Mahindra said the company was working with the government and other private players to set up charging stations in India. Mahindra was also focusing on developing electric fleet cars and taxis, Goenka said.The cost of setting up a car charging station in India ranges from $500 to $25,000, depending on the charging speed, according to a 2016 report by online journal IOPscience.While the proposed policy suggests setting up battery swapping stations and using tax revenues from sales of petrol and diesel vehicles to set up charging stations, it does not specify the investment needed or whether the government would contribute.“For full electric vehicles, the economic gap remains huge and the charging infrastructure needed does not exist,�� said a spokesman at Tata Motors. The company makes electric buses and is working on developing electric and hybrid cars.Most automakers have focused on bringing in hybrid models that are seen as a stepping stone to electrification. Toyota recently launched its luxury hybrid brand Prius in India, while Hyundai Motor plans to debut its Ioniq hybrid sedan next year.Maruti’s parent Suzuki Motor, along with Toshiba and Denso, plans to invest 20 billion yen ($180 million) to set up a lithium ion battery plant in India which would support Maruti’s plan to build more hybrids.But the apparent sharp shift in policymakers�� thinking in favor of electrification is forcing automakers like Toyota and Nissan Motor to seek more clarity before finalising future products for India, while Hyundai may delay new launches.Toyota, the world’s No. 2 carmaker by sales, had planned to have a hybrid variant for all its vehicles in India, but the company’s future launches would now depend on the new policy, said Shekar Viswanathan, vice chairman of its Indian subsidiary.Nissan, which plans to launch a hybrid SUV later this year, said in a statement it was waiting for more clarity before deciding whether to bring electric cars to India.A plan by Hyundai to launch at least three hybrid cars in India in 2019-2020 would likely to be delayed, said a source.Hyundai did not comment on queries related to delays.“If the government will be aggressive on electric vehicles and not support other technologies, companies will need to rethink investments,�� said an executive with an Asian carmaker.	-1.93812896
TOKYO, March 5 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average extended losses into a fourth day as concerns over a global trade war dented sentiment, with steelmakers, automakers and shipping companies underperforming the market.The Nikkei fell 0.5 percent to 21,075.44 in midmorning trade, after the yen got a lift from safe-haven flows as risk sentiment soured after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.Steel shares tumbled again, with Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal dropping 1.5 percent, JFE Holdings and Kobe Steel sliding 1.5 percent.Automakers, big consumers of steel and aluminium, also lost ground. Honda Motor Co fell 1.8 percent, Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.4 percent and Subaru Corp shed 1.1 percent.Shippers were sold, with Mitsui OSK Lines falling 2.5 percent and Kawasaki Kisen off 2.1 percent.With the dollar falling for a fourth straight session, investors have started to worry that Japanese companies will have to lower their dollar-yen assumptions for the next fiscal year, which would impact their profit outlook.The dollar stood at 105.43 yen, slightly above Friday’s low of 105.23, a level not seen since November 2016.The broader Topix dropped 0.7 percent to 1,696.91.	-2.458390594
MELBOURNE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is pushing to secure at least 60 percent of its rare earth needs from outside China within four years, as it bolsters efforts to curb its dependence on the world’s biggest producer of elements crucial in smart phones, computers and cars.Japan aims to sign a deal as early as this month that would give it four types of light rare earths from India, and has helped fund an Australian rare earths mine and Malaysian processing plant built by Australia’s Lynas Corp.Its search for supply security has also led to a joint venture in Kazakhstan, recycling rare earths from batteries and motor magnets, and even exploring for rare earths in the Pacific Ocean seabed. China currently produces about 90 percent of the world’s rare earths.Japan, which sources virtually all its rare earths from China, either directly or indirectly, has been trying to find new sources of supply since its neighbor held back shipments in 2010 during a row over disputed islands and then curbed global exports to preserve its own resources.“It is critically important for Japan to secure sources of rare earths outside of China,�� said Akira Terakawa, deputy director at mineral and natural resources division of Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.The Indian deal would provide 15 percent of Japan’s needs. If Lynas is able to ramp up production as agreed, Japan could be sourcing more than 60 percent of its expected rare earths demand from outside China by 2018, based on Reuters calculations from Japanese demand data and growth figures provided by a trading house which deals with rare earths.Japanese demand is expected to be about 18,000 tonnes a year in 2018, with Lynas supplying 8,500 tonnes a year to Sojitz and India providing 2,500 tonnes.The Indian project, being undertaken by a subsidiary of the Indian Department of Atomic Energy and Japanese trading house Toyota Tsusho Corp, aims to produce light rare earths elements such as cerium, a Toyota Tsusho spokesman said.The two firms are negotiating commercial conditions, but the timing of an agreement has not been settled, he said.Japanese manufacturers like Panasonic Corp, Toshiba Corp and TDK Corp all use rare earths in their products, while car makers like Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd rely on rare earths for motor magnets that drive automated seats and windows, and for batteries used in hybrid vehicles.Toyota, the world’s best-selling car maker, has been trying to cut its use of rare earths metals and at the same time has been working to recycle the metals from nickel-metal hydride hybrid batteries to use in new batteries.However recycling - dubbed urban mining - is seen only as a long-term solution, as there won’t be enough used hybrid vehicles to tap for material until after 2025, according to Japan’s government-backed research body New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).Japan is particularly focused on alternative sources of the heavy rare earth element dysprosium, used in hybrid cars and energy saving appliances, for which supply is much tighter than for light rare earths elements like lanthanum and cerium.“We are continuing our efforts to develop alternatives for dysprosium as there is a supply risk for the metal as it still heavily depends on China,�� said an official in the electronics, materials technology and nanotechnology department of NEDO.Another Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp is working with Kazakhstan’s state nuclear company to produce rare earth metals including dysprosium, and the joint venture sent a trial shipment to Russia in June, according to Sumitomo.Sumitomo has said it aims to produce 1,500 tonnes of rare earths a year from the venture but has given no timeframe.Japan is not stopping at land-based sources of rare earths, with Deep Ocean Resources Development Co and Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC) having snapped up two of 24 contracts issued by the International Seabed Authority to explore international waters for metals and minerals.JOGMEC began a three-year program last year, drilling around 40 sites near Minamitorishima island in southern Japan to assess reserves.“Our research is at an early stage and we still don’t know how much rare earths there are in the deep seabed,�� a JOGMEC spokesman said.	0.266345906
(Adds comments)BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Sales in China by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. and its two local joint-venture partners fell 15.1 percent in August from a year earlier for a second consecutive monthly decline, a company spokesman said on Monday.Toyota’s China vehicle sales totaled about 75,300 vehicles last month. The year-on-year decline in August followed a 5 percent slide in July, the Beijing-based spokesman, Takanori Yokoi, said.The last time sales fell two months in a row for Toyota was a two-month period ended Jan. 31 this year, which was mainly due to China’s lunar new year holiday. In December 2011, overall Toyota vehicle sales in China slid 9.6 percent, followed by a 26.2 percent decline in January.Yokoi said Toyota was not alarmed by the two consecutive monthly declines. He noted the sales slides in July and August were caused chiefly by a technical factor.The spokesman said sales in July and August 2011 were “unusually high�� following three months of sluggish business in the wake of Japan’s devastating earthquake on March 11 that year.The earthquake and a tsunami it caused paralyzed production of key components in Japan and impacted Toyota’s vehicle production around the world, including China, depriving dealers of cars to sell. Production returned to more normal levels by late June last year and sales rose sharply in following months, Yokoi said.For the first eight months of this year, Toyota China sales were still up from a year earlier. Its sales through August totaled about 596,100 vehicles, up 13.4 percent from the same period last year, according to Yokoi.The Japanese automaker is aiming to sell a total of 1 million cars in China this year and Yokoi said Toyota was still on track to achieve that objective despite the sales decline in August.“We don’t see a problem in achieve 1 million sales for the year,�� the spokesman said.Toyota’s China sales last year totaled about 883,400 vehicles, a 4.4 percent increase from 2010, reflecting in part the general slowdown of automobile sales in China last year.	0.3175409628
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Tuesday it expects profit to drop by 80% to its lowest in nine years, as Japan's biggest automaker grapples with the impact of the novel coronavirus which has sapped global demand for vehicles.The expected damage to Toyota’s bottom line highlights how carmakers will struggle to recover from the virus in the coming months as they gradually restart factories after curbs on public movement prevented workers in many countries from commuting.The industry expects limited output due to fractured supply chains and social distancing measures at plants, along with weak demand as job losses and concern about an economic downturn weigh on consumer spending on major purchases like cars.Toyota, one of the world’s most profitable automakers, expects to take a whopping 1.5 trillion yen ($13.95 billion) hit from a fall in global vehicle sales this year due largely to the virus, yet it still expects to eke out an operating profit of 500 billion yen in the year to March.“The coronavirus has dealt us a bigger shock than the 2008 global financial crisis,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda said at a livestreamed media briefing.“We anticipate a big drop in sales volumes, but despite that we are expecting to remain in the black. We hope to become a leader of the country’s economic recovery.”Toyota sees its operating profit in free fall from 2.44 trillion yen in the year just ended, to its weakest profit since the 2011/12 financial year.The automaker forecast global sales of 8.9 million vehicles - a nine-year low - versus 10.46 million in the year just ended. It expects sales to recover to 2019 levels next year.Toyota's outlook came as rivals including Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and General Motors GM.N have refrained from issuing forecasts, citing uncertainty about the coronavirus.On Tuesday, Honda posted its weakest annual profit in four years, after a 28% drop in fourth-quarter vehicle sales plunged the automaker into an operating loss of 5.2 billion yen, its first quarterly loss since the March 2016 quarter.Japanese automakers are bracing for a year of falling car sales as economists anticipate a slow and patchy recovery from the pandemic.As a result, some analysts see a cut in annual global vehicle sales by around a third, compared with an 11% fall in 2009/10 after the global financial crisis.Toyota expects sales to remain weak through December, before returning to 2019 levels sometime next year.In the year ended March, Toyota said it took a 160 billion yen profit hit from the virus due to a cut in annual sales of 127,000 vehicles from a record high of 10.6 million last year.For interactive charts on Toyota's financial performance, click here tmsnrt.rs/3fHr4QA.The impact was felt hardest in North America, a key market, where sales fell 8% during the March quarter, resulting in an operating loss there.Despite the profit slump and a sharp cut to margins, Toyota said it would pour more than 1 trillion yen each into capital expenditure and R&amp;D investment, keeping spending largely unchanged from last year.“We cannot stop investing in the future,�� Operating Officer Koji Kobayashi told reporters.	3.553299492
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Didi Chuxing said on Friday it had completed a fundraising round of over $500 million for its autonomous driving subsidiary that was led by SoftBank Group's 9984.T Vision Fund 2. The ridehailing giant said in a statement the round marked the first time Didi’s autonomous driving business had brought in external funding since it became a standalone unit last year and was also the single largest fundraising round in China’s self-driving sector.Didi said it would use the capital to invest further in the research and development of autonomous driving technology as well as testing, and accelerate the deployment of autonomous driving services.Didi has gained open-road testing licences in California, Beijing, Shanghai and Suzhou, it said. It first began to develop and test autonomous driving vehicles in 2016.The fundraising comes as SoftBank has been selling off other stakes to raise cash for stock buybacks aimed at supporting the price of its shares as its tech investments falter. Some of the Japanese firm's investments, including Uber UBER.N and Indian-based hotel chain Oyo, have been hugely impacted by lockdowns in the coronavirus pandemic.Autonomous driving technology has remained popular with investors even amid the pandemic. Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O this month raised an additional $750 million in its first external investment round, while China's Pony.ai raised $462 million from investors led by Toyota Motor 7203.T in February.	0.347963622
TOKYO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Japan’s land prices fell the least since the global financial crisis in the year to July 1, while commercial land in the three biggest cities rose in value for the first time in the same period, the latest signs that deflation is easing its stubborn grip on the country.Land prices nationwide fell 1.9 percent, narrowing from the previous year’s 2.7 percent decline and the smallest drop since 2008, a government survey showed on Thursday.This brings Japan closer to ending 22 years of falling land prices - a legacy of the country’s massive 1980s asset bubble.The gradual narrowing of land-price declines is good news for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose top priority is ending Japan’s long battle with deflation and spurring sustained growth.But the land ministry data also show how uneven the real-estate improvement has been, with rises limited to the best properties in the choicest areas.Commercial land prices in the greater Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya areas ticked up 0.6 percent, and residential land in Nagoya - home of Toyota Motor Corp - rose 0.7 percent, the first such increases since prices tumbled in the wake of Lehman Brothers�� collapse.Even as real estate in most of Japan remains depressed, a boom in investment in the hottest properties, driven by a search for yield and hopes for “Abenomics,�� has recently shown signs of a mini-bubble.Foreign investors have poured into upper-end Tokyo properties and recently extended their purchases to major regional cities.Last month, a group including former U.S. insurance magnate Maurice “Hank�� Greenberg and an Abu Dhabi sovereign fund agreed to buy a 31-year old office building in Tokyo for about $1 billion.A building in Tokyo’s posh Ginza district housing the flagship store of jewelers Tiffany &amp; Co, is up for sale as owner Asia Pacific Land bets on a recovery in a property prices.But some market players doubt the sustainability of the property upswing.“I question whether or not actual fundamentals are driving the recovery,�� said Robert Zulkoski, chairman and chief executive of Laurasia Capital Management, a Singapore-based alternative-asset manager.“Is it just a reflection of all the liquidity that’s in the market trying to find investment yield?�� he said to Reuters. “It’s very hard to analyze what’s really going on in the market. I am hopeful, but I am cautious.”Tokyo may continue to get a lift after winning the right to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, given expectations that redevelopment projects will buoy prices, some investors and developers say.Mitsubishi Estate, a leading developer, said visits to a showroom for its condominium project in Tokyo’s Harumi district, the planned site of the Olympic village, have almost tripled since Tokyo was awarded the Olympics earlier this month.At the high end of the market, Mitsubishi Estate said 22 units in a high-end condominium it is developing near the Imperial Palace all sold out on the days they became available, starting last week.The project, with unit prices ranging from 160 million yen ($1.61 million) to 542 million yen, was five times oversubscribed, the company said.Amid continued declines in nationwide residential land prices, Nagoya’s upturn was driven by robust profits at Toyota, a land ministry official said. The world’s biggest car maker and its related businesses are a dominant presence in that area of western Japan.Toyota last month posted a near-record quarterly profit thanks to overseas sales that were helped by the falling yen. The booming auto industry has encouraged consumers in Nagoya to spend more, which has driven development of commercial facilities and housing demand, the official said.Tokyo’s residential land prices edged down 0.1 percent, while those in Osaka fell 0.4 percent.The decline in nationwide prices for industrial land slowed to 2.3 percent, buoyed by aggressive development by logistics operators, said the ministry official.	-0.05407493241

LONDON (Reuters) - McLaren’s Fernando Alonso will race the next two editions of the Le Mans 24 Hours with favorites Toyota while also combining a world endurance campaign with Formula One this season.McLaren and Toyota made the announcement, which had been widely expected and is likely to be one of the talking points of the motorsport year, in separate statements on Tuesday.“I’ve never been shy about my aim of winning motorsport’s Triple Crown �� the Monaco Grand Prix, the Indy 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans,�� the double Formula One world champion said.“We tried for Indy last year, came close, but just missed out,�� added the Spaniard, who led at Indianapolis before a late engine failure. “This year, I have the chance thanks to McLaren to race for the win at Le Mans.“It is a big challenge �� much can go wrong �� but I am ready, prepared and looking forward to the fight.”The 36-year-old, who has a one year contract with options at McLaren, raced in the 24 Hours of Daytona last weekend as preparation for Le Mans.Toyota were the obvious team to link up with as the sole manufacturer remaining in the top LMP1 category following the departure of World Endurance (WEC) champions Porsche.McLaren executive director Zak Brown said he was satisfied Alonso’s Le Mans commitments would not detract from his main job in Formula One.McLaren are starting a new partnership with Renault this season and hoping to get back on the podium after three difficult years with Honda, Toyota’s domestic rivals.Alonso will miss the Japanese leg of the WEC season at Fuji on Oct. 21 since that clashes with the U.S. Formula One Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.“It’s no secret that Fernando has wanted to contest the Le Mans 24 Hours,�� Brown said.“And I think everybody within our organization appreciates that a motivated, hungry and happy world-class driver such as Fernando is a formidable asset for any team in F1.”Toyota said Alonso would be sharing their number eight TS050 hybrid car with Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi and Japanese Kazuki Nakajima, both ex-Formula One drivers.Alonso will make his WEC debut at Spa-Francorchamps, the Belgian Grand Prix circuit, for the Six Hours race in May.The 2018-19 WEC “super season�� includes two editions of Le Mans for the first time as a move toward a championship that will start in the European summer and end with the French endurance classic.	-5.314675174
July 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will launch a car-sharing service through affiliated car-rental shops across Japan, the Nikkei reported on Wednesday.Car-sharing services, such as U.S.-based Zipcar, have taken off as they let customers hire a car for an hour or less at a time. Hertz has also entered the business.Toyota’s hourly rental rate will be set at around 1,000 yen, with some variations based on region and other factors, the Nikkei reported. It said there would be no sign-up fees or annual membership dues.Toyota is already operating a pilot program and plans a full launch under a new brand at about 10 affiliated car-rental locations such as Hokkaido, Tokyo and Aichi Prefecture, the daily said.The company will gradually expand the service nationwide by urging car-rental affiliates to introduce it at their roughly 1,200 locations, the business daily said.

TOKYO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Snow-choked roads cut off thousands on Tuesday as parts of Japan struggled to dig out from its second storm in a week, with the death toll rising to at least 23.Train services were suspended in some areas after the Valentine’s Day storm dumped more than a metre of snow in parts of central Japan and blanketed the capital with record snow for the second weekend in a row, snarling airline traffic and slowing production at some Japanese automakers.The freak storm dumped more than 1.1 metres of snow in Yamanashi prefecture in central Japan, the most in more than a century of record-keeping, and lesser amounts across a wide swathe of the eastern and northeastern parts of the nation. Tokyo was hit by 27 cm (10.6 inches).By Tuesday, least 23 people had died, including some killed in traffic accidents or by being caught under snow that fell from roofs. Several died in cars stuck in the snow, apparently from carbon monoxide poisoning as they ran their car engines to keep warm.At the peak of the storm, thousands of households lost power and hundreds of flights were cancelled.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T U.S. unit said on Thursday it is recalling about 694,000 Sienna minivans in North America due to a shift lever problem.Toyota USA said that because of possible damage to the shift lock solenoid installed in vehicles involved in the recall, the minivans could shift out of “park�� and roll away without the driver depressing the brake pedal.The vehicles were made at Toyota’s plant in Indiana. The Siennas are from model years 2007 to 2009 and from 2004 to 2005.Most of the recalled vehicles, about 615,000, are in the United States. About 56,000 of the recalled minivans are registered in Canada, 23,000 in Mexico, 300 in Germany and 10 in Guatemala.Toyota spokeswoman Cindy Knight said Toyota has received reports of 21 “minor�� accidents in the United States and three minor accidents in Canada. Two of the incidents involved what Toyota called minor injuries, such as bruises.Sienna is the second-best-selling minivan in the U.S. market, behind the Dodge Caravan made by Chrysler, an affiliate of Fiat SpA FIA.MI. Sienna's sales through August were up 5 percent from a year earlier at 86,459 and Caravan's sales were down 15 percent at 94,639, according to Autodata Corp.	-1.450944265
(Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Industries Corp 6201.T is competing against U.S. diversified industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc HON.N to acquire U.S. distribution systems and logistics company Intelligrated Inc, people familiar with the matter said.The strong interest in the company follows German forklift truck maker Kion Group AG's KGX.DE agreement last week to buy Intelligrated's larger peer Dematic for $3.25 billion to expand into automated warehouses and supply chains that have ballooned with the growth of e-commerce.A deal for Intelligrated could come in days and value the privately held company at around $1.5 billion, including debt, the people said this week. There is no certainty, however, that any acquisition agreement will be reached, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Honeywell declined to comment. Toyota Industries and Intelligrated did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Intelligrated, based in Mason, Ohio, manufactures, services and installs high-speed automated material handling equipment in customer distribution centers that primarily serve online retailers.Private equity firm Permira Advisers LLC acquired Intelligrated in 2012 for more than $500 million from Gryphon Investors, another private equity firm. Reuters reported in March that Permira was working with Centerview Partners Holdings LLC and Nomura Co Ltd 9716.T on an auction for Intelligrated.Due to increased online sales and demand for faster delivery times, the market for supply chain automation is expected to grow by 10 percent by 2019, Kion said in its presentation on the Dematic deal last week.	11.63187475
(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump warned German car companies he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the U.S. market from Mexico, singling out luxury carmaker BMW for criticism following previous broadsides aimed at General Motors, Ford and Toyota.Mexico accounts for a fifth of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.Auto assembly is projected to more than double in size between 2010 and 2020 as carmakers invest around $13 billion to move 3.3 million units of capacity from Japan, Germany and South Korea. Carmakers are attracted by Mexico’s unique free trade position as well as lower labor costs.Below are some facts on the operations of the main global carmakers with plants in Mexico. Production figures are according to the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.NISSAN 7201.T2015 production: 822,948 vehiclesNissan is the largest automaker operating in Mexico. It built its first overseas plant in Mexico 50 years ago and now produces mainly its entry-level Versa and Sentra sedans there. It exports roughly half of its output to the United States, where it also has production plants. Nissan and Renault Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said this month he was watching the incoming Trump administration closely and would respond to whatever policies it adopts.GENERAL MOTORS GM.N2015 production: 690,446Trump has criticized GM for building cars in Mexico while laying off workers in the United States. GM said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, as part of a $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. It has defended the arrangement as part of its strategy to serve global customers. In November, GM said it planned to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants in early 2017. When asked earlier this month about the company’s plans for investments in Mexico, GM CEO Mary Barra said she could not comment, but emphasized a willingness to cooperate with the incoming Trump administration.FIAT-CHRYSLER FCHA.MI2015 production: 503,589Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said this month that uncertainty over Trump’s trade and tax policies could lead automakers to delay investments in Mexico, and confirmed plans to create 2,000 jobs at his company’s U.S. factories with an investment of $1 billion. He said he had not made a decision on whether to move production of certain Ram heavy-duty pickups from Mexico to the Unites States. “If tomorrow morning President-elect Trump decides to impose a border tax on anything that comes up from Mexico, then we’ll have to adjust,�� he said.VOLKSWAGEN VOWG_p.DE2015 production: 457,517Volkswagen has had a plant in Mexico for 50 years and is not shifting any jobs to Mexico from the United States. It has around 16,500 employees in Mexico, who built 345,000 engines as well as cars in 2015. In the United States, it has around 3,200 workers at its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee which built 87,000 cars in 2015. It plans to invest $7 billion in the United States between 2015 and 2019. Its Audi luxury car brand opened a $1.3 billion factory in Mexico last year, its first in the country and eventually slated to be its only source globally for its Q5 SUVs. It plans initial production of 150,000 cars a year.FORD F.N2015 production: 433,752Ford scrapped a planned $1.6 billion Mexican car factory this month and added 700 jobs at a cost of $700 million in Michigan following criticism by Trump. It said it was a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the plant, and CEO Mark Fields said Ford would have made the same decision even had Trump not been elected. Ford still plans to shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Mexico.HONDA 7267.T2015 production: 203,657Honda has two auto plants in Mexico, which together build around 100,000 motorcycles a year as well as cars. Vehicles made in Mexico comprise less than 10 percent of Honda’s total U.S. vehicle sales. Honda said in October it was shifting production of the new generation of its CR-V sport utility vehicle to the United States from Mexico. But its president said it had no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico, preferring to wait until after Trump’s inauguration.MAZDA 7261.T2015 production: 182,357Mazda began producing cars in Mexico in 2014, with production of the Mazda3 sedan for the United States. Vehicles made in Mexico comprise around 30 percent of Mazda’s total U.S. vehicle sales.TOYOTA 7203.T2015 production: 104,810Toyota plans to raise output from its plant in Baja California, Mexico to around 160,000 units by 2018. It is also building a plant in Guanajuato city which will have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019. Trump took on Toyota earlier this month, warning the world’s largest automaker that it would face a “big border tax�� if it exported Mexico-built cars to the U.S. market. Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in response: “We’re always considering ways to increase production in the United States, regardless of the political situation.�� Vehicles made in Mexico comprise less than 10 percent of Toyota’s total U.S. vehicle sales. But it has said its Guanajuato plant under construction in Mexico will produce the entry-level Corolla sedan, a vehicle segment currently produced at its plants in Mississippi, Missouri, and Ontario, Canada.Toyota plans to invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, the same as in the previous five years.KIA 000270.KS, HYUNDAI 005380.KSKia is building a $1 billion plant in Mexico, with a capacity of 300,000 vehicles a year, to cater for demand from North and South America. Affiliate Hyundai also plans to build its Accent small car at the Kia factory this year, two people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, shifting output out of high-cost South Korea. It will be the first Hyundai car to be made in Mexico.BMW BMWG.DEBMW is building a new plant in Mexico, where it plans to invest $2.2 billion by 2019 for annual production of 150,000 cars, with the output intended for the world market. It also has sizeable factories in the United States, where it builds higher-margin SUVs for export to Asia and Europe.DAIMLER DAIGn.DEDaimler has said it plans to begin assembling Mercedes-Benz vehicles in 2018 from a $1 billion facility shared with Renault-Nissan RENA.PA, 7201.T in Aguascalientes in Mexico.	-4.273287729
TOKYO Dec 7 (Reuters) - A high-ranking Toyota Motor Corp executive believes that it will take the automaker a year to recover from the effects of a diplomatic row between Japan and China, the Kyodo news agency reported on Friday.Calls for boycotts of Japanese goods in response to a territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea took a heavy toll of Toyota’s sales in China, falling 50 percent in September and 44 percent in October.The decline slowed in November, with a 22 percent year-on-year fall to 63,800 vehicles. However, Kyodo said that Hiroji Onishi, senior manager in charge of Toyota’s Chinese operations, gave a grim outlook in a Nov. 26 meeting with the company’s labour union leaders.“We have no choice but to believe it is going to be hard to regain the (pre-September) sales pace,�� Onishi was quoted as saying by Kyodo.“Deducing from past incidents, it would likely take at least one year, and we are making all sorts of adjustments to our plans.”A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on Friday.The company said at the start of this year that it aimed to sell 1 million cars a year in China.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T are set to launch a joint venture next year to produce batteries for electric vehicles (EV) in an effort to compete with Chinese rivals, a source familiar with the matter said.The joint venture, to be owned 51 percent by Toyota and the rest by Panasonic, could also provide batteries to Toyota's EV technology partners Mazda Corp 7261.T and Subaru Corp 7270.T, the source said on Sunday.The source declined to be identified because the talks on the joint venture are private.A joint venture would build on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement.A Toyota spokesman said the two companies have been working on the battery partnership announced in 2017 and declined to comment further. Panasonic made the same comment in a statement.The two companies may announce the joint venture plan as early as this week, according to the source.The battery joint venture will help Toyota achieve an annual sales target of around 1 million zero-emission battery EVs and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) by 2030.It will also give Panasonic cost and scale advantages in battery production at a time when China's Contemporary Amperex Technology 300750.SZ has grown to be on par with the long-time industry leader on the back of the rapidly growing home market.Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc's TSLA.O current production models, could also reduce its heavy reliance on the U.S. EV maker whose production delays previously weighed on the Japanese company's earnings.Panasonic is set to lose its exclusivity as Tesla plans to source cell production locally at a new auto plant in Shanghai, “most likely from several companies�� including Panasonic, Elon Musk, Tesla chief executive, tweeted in November.The reported joint venture plan boosted shares of Panasonic by as much as 4 percent on Monday, whereas Toyota shares were almost flat.Under the planned joint venture, Panasonic would shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla will remain under the company, the source said.Panasonic already makes prismatic batteries for Toyota, whereas for Tesla it makes cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops.It's not clear yet how Panasonic would supply its prismatic batteries to other automotive clients, which include Honda Motor 7267.T and Ford Motor F.N.	-1.707119741
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.It may take just 40 minutes to replace the gizmo responsible for Toyota’s latest embarrassment, but with 7.4 million cars to fix, that’s 565 years of mechanic time. Actually it is neither the first nor the most serious of Toyota’s recent difficulties. But the Japanese automaker’s problems are beginning to look unending.After battling back to profit after the global crisis in 2009, it was struck with a series of product faults. In early 2011, the devastating earthquake and tsunami crippled production. And violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in China over disputed islands cut its sales there in half last month as patriotic consumers switched to other countries�� cars.Considering the succession of setbacks, it is testament to Toyota’s strength that it has soldiered on as well as it has. And while the latest product problem is extensive �� it affects a broad range of worldwide models and is the largest recall since Ford’s faulty ignitions in 1996 �� it is unlikely to sink the company.Toyota’s quarterly profit is likely to be several times the cost of repairs. Say the bill comes to half the $2 billion set aside in 2010 to deal with faulty accelerators: it would swallow only about 26 percent of the company’s profit in the latest three-month reporting period. Toyota can still borrow 10-year money at roughly 1.5 percent and has $27.4 billion in cash. Toyota recently regained its position as the world’s best-selling marque, with vehicle sales rising 86 percent in the second quarter of this year. China, meanwhile, only accounts for about 12 percent of global sales.Still, fresh quality issues could hurt Toyota in the United States. Sales there had been recovering nicely. But rivals such as South Korea’s Hyundai have narrowed the gap in terms of perceived quality, making it harder for Toyota to charge the premium required to justify making half its cars at home in Japan. The yen has risen 49 percent against the U.S. dollar in the past five years, and Toyota estimated that cost it $3 billion in its latest fiscal year.Toyota is planning to shift about a seventh of Japanese production to India, Thailand and North America. That will help cut costs, but losing the “Made in Japan�� label may only make it harder for Toyota to convince consumers that it can steer clear of alarming product glitches in future.	3.80761523

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Wednesday said that operations at its plants in Japan may be affected by supply chain issues linked to the new coronavirus outbreak in the coming weeks, as the global outbreak gathers pace.The automaker, which operates 16 vehicle and components sites in Japan, said that it would decide on how to continue operations at its domestic plants from the week of March 9, after keeping output normal through the week of March 2.Plants may be affected by potential supply disruptions in China as some plants in the epicentre of the virus outbreak remain are unable to produce and transport goods, while some plants remain closed under orders by regional authorities.“We are receiving parts from China as normal for the moment, but we will assess the situation after the week of March 2,�� a Toyota spokeswoman told Reuters.Japan is a major site of production for the company, accounting for nearly half of the 10.7 million cars its sold globally in 2019.The automaker also said it would cancel all non-essential travel for employees in Japan, the latest move by a global company to curb operations as the speed of the virus outbreak appears to gather pace.	-4.703196347
TOKYO, March 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday that production at its vehicle plant in Guangzhou, China, would return to normal on Monday, after a month-long output suspension due to the coronavirus outbreak.The Japanese automaker’s plant in southeast China will resume its second shift, returning to production levels from before the outbreak accelerated last month. The plant, which produces the Camry sedan and the Yaris compact hatchback models, resumed its first shift earlier this month.Operations at two other Toyota plants, in Changchun, Jilin Province, and Chengdu, Sichuan Province, have also returned to normal, while its plant in Tianjin is only operating a single shift, compared with double shifts at the start of the year.Global automakers continue to grapple with production in China due to logistical delays and limited workforces as the country’s manufacturing sector slowly recovers from coronavirus-related stoppages, which have disrupted the global supply chain.

(Reuters) - Cyber-security firm Netskope said on Tuesday it has raised $100 million from existing and new investors to fund product development and marketing programs that will help the firm become profitable and set the stage to go public.“This makes us financially independent,�� founder and Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Beri said via phone. “We won’t be required to ever raise capital again.”The Series E round was led by existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Accel. Sapphire Ventures and Geodesic Capital invested in the firm for the first time, while Social Capital and Iconiq Capital increased their investment in the firm, according to Netskope.Beri declined comment on valuation, but said that it was a “significant�� increase compared to a $75 million Series D round in 2015.He declined to say how much revenue the company brought in last year, though he said it tripled and that he expects growth to continue at that rate.The firm, which helps large organizations monitor and secure employee use of cloud services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, has raised $231 million since it was founded in 2012.Its more than 350 customers include medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp BSX.N, apparel maker Levi Strauss &amp; Co and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.	0.8741746489
* Toyota had been seeking vote on cost cutting measures* Unprecedented pressure on Toyota Australian after GM exit* Fears for supplier network if Toyota followsSYDNEY, Dec 12 (Reuters) - An Australian court on Thursday blocked Toyota Motor Corp from holding an employee vote on proposed contract changes, dealing a blow to the company as it seeks to cut costs and decide its manufacturing future in the country.The world’s largest automaker has been seeking to make changes to its workplace agreement to improve productivity in Australia, where General Motors Co has just made the decision to stop production.There have been widespread concerns that an exit by GM’s Holden unit would be followed by Toyota, threatening around 150 parts and component suppliers and the entire domestic auto industry which directly employs more than 40,000 people.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, under fire for not doing enough to keep Holden going, said he had been talking to Toyota.“I deeply regret for the last three months, which is as long as we have been in government, we haven’t been able to hold Holden,�� Abbott told reporters in Canberra on Thursday. “The challenge now is to ensure, as far as we reasonably can, that Toyota stays and that is what we are working on.”The Federal Court of Australia upheld a complaint filed by four employees that Toyota could not change its work agreement until it expires in March 2015, Toyota said in a statement.Toyota Australia president and CEO Max Yasuda said he was disappointed with the court decision.“We believe that we are within our rights to vary our workplace agreement provided the majority of our employees support the changes through a formal vote,�� Yasuda said in a statement.Yasuda said the proposed changes were meant to remove “outdated and uncompetitive�� terms and conditions to make Toyota Australia competitive.“GM Holden’s planned closure in 2017 will put our manufacturing operations and the local supplier network under unprecedented pressure, so it is now more important than ever before that we make urgent changes,�� he said.Representatives of Toyota workers disagreed.“It’s not the wages and conditions that are going to decide the future of Toyota, it’s going to be the knock-on effect of what happens in the auto components sector and what kind of support the government is going to do,�� Dave Oliver, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.GM said on Wednesday it was pulling out of Australian car production as it was no longer viable due to the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, and a small, fragmented and highly competitive domestic market.In May, Ford Motor Co said it would shut its two Australian auto plants in October 2016, blaming similar factors.GM’s Holden unit had been asking for additional support from the government, but had been rejected.Toyota, which employs 4,000 people and produced almost 100,000 vehicles at its Altona plant in Australia last year, said it was now considering its options, including whether it would appeal the decision.Australia has annual sales of around 1.1 million new vehicles, but sales of locally manufactured vehicles have fallen to less than a quarter of that, from almost 389,000 in 2005.Toyota is the most successful automaker in Australia, with a market share around 20 percent and a healthy export business.	0.150981379
April 19 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to make the Lexus ES 350 sedan at its Kentucky plant in 2015, marking the first time that the Japanese automaker has built a vehicle from its luxury lineup in the United States.Toyota announced on Friday that it will invest $360 million at the Georgetown factory, which assembles the Toyota Camry and other models. The move will generate 750 new jobs.About 50,000 sedans will be produced each year, bringing the plant’s total production capacity to more than 550,000 vehicles.“It is fitting the first country to build the ES outside of Japan is the United States, because this is home for Lexus -- it is where the brand was founded and it is still the biggest market for the luxury brand,�� Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota, said during a news conference in New York.Expanding U.S. production fits in with Toyota’s strategy to make cars in the markets where its customers live. The ES sedan was the second most popular Lexus model in the United States last year after the RX sport utility vehicle.The ES represented 9.2 percent of sales in the U.S. market for entry-level luxury cars in 2012, according to data from Kelley Blue Book.The move also counters the effect of the strong yen, which has made exporting from Japan expensive. Converting overseas profits back into the yen has pinched profits. The yen’s decline since last year has not changed that strategy.“This decision is in line with two key goals,�� Toyoda said. “First, to serve our U.S. customers. And second, reduce the effect of the exchange rate on our customers.��	14.63066916
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales hit levels in June not seen since before the financial crisis that led to the bankruptcy of two American automakers, posting the best annualized figures in eight years.U.S. June sales rose 1.2 percent, beating expectations of a decline of 3 percent, and the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate hit 16.98 million vehicles, the highest since the July 2006, industry consultant Autodata Corp said.General Motors Co bucked Wall Street’s low expectations as well as negative publicity over a flood of safety recalls, reporting a 1 percent rise in U.S. sales in June. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected GM’s sales to fall about 6 percent.John Krafcik, president of car shopping site TrueCar.com, said consumers are suffering from recall “fatigue�� and tuning out the onslaught of bad news from GM and other automakers.He added that GM’s sales remain strong in part because consumers focus on brand names such as Chevrolet and Buick rather than the corporate name “General Motors.”Investors also showed faith in GM on Tuesday, sending its shares up 3 percent a day after the automaker’s total for recalls in the half-year rose to 29 million vehicles.Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co also reported year-to-year increases. They all topped analysts�� expectations, as did Ford Motor Co. Honda Motor Co Ltd sales barely missed expectations.“Sales in the first half of 2014 indicate a steadily recovering industry, and we expect this pace to increase as we move into the second part of the year,�� said Bill Fay, Toyota Division group vice president and general manager.Ford sales fell 5 percent to 222,064 vehicles, but the company still beat the analysts�� forecast of 217,007.Chrysler had a 9 percent gain to 171,086, Toyota rose 3 percent to 201,714 and Nissan was up 5 percent at 109,643.Combined Hyundai-Kia sales increased 2 percent to 118,051 vehicles.Honda sales declined 6 percent to 129,023.U.S. June sales of the Volkswagen AG group, which includes Audi and Porsche, dropped 8 percent to 49,796.Ford sales analyst Erich Merkle said the average transaction prices industry wide for pickup trucks were up more than $3,300 from a year ago. Pickup trucks are critical for the three domestic automakers because of their high profit margins.Despite substantial discounts, demand for Ford’s full-size F-series pickups - the best-selling vehicles in the industry - declined 11 percent to 60,560. The automaker is changing over to a brand-new version of the F-series for the 2015 model year.GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups sold a combined 58,925 in June, up a fraction from a year ago, while Chrysler’s Ram pickup was up 12 percent to 33,149.Ford said sales of some of its more popular U.S. models slumped in June, including Fiesta, Taurus, Mustang and Edge.At GM, key sedans Chevrolet Cruze, Impala and Malibu all had weaker sales.	-3.519855596

Kyle Busch wins at Michigan in first Xfinity race since accidentBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeBROOKLYN, Mich. -- In his first NASCAR Xfinity Series race back from a broken right leg and left foot, Kyle Busch proved conclusively that he hasn’t lost a step.Taking advantage of contact between the Chevrolet of Kevin Harvick and the Ford of polesitter Joey Logano -- as those two drivers were battling for the lead -- Busch passed Chase Elliott for the lead on lap 122 of 125 and held on to win Saturday’s Great Clips 250 at Michigan International Speedway.Busch’s series-best 71st victory, his second at the two-mile track, came nearly two months after the driver of the No. 54 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota was sidelined by a brutal Feb. 21 crash into a concrete wall in Turn 1 at Daytona International Speedway.Busch returned to NASCAR Sprint Cup Series action in the Sprint All-Star Race in May, but deferred his Xfinity Series comeback to Saturday’s race at Michigan.“It feels good,�� Busch said after climbing from his car in Victory Lane. “This is only a preliminary for what we’ve got to do on Sundays (in the Sprint Cup Series), but it’s a start. You’ve got to start somewhere, right?“I can’t say enough about this team. (Crew chief) Chris Gayle did an awesome job today with this race car. We messed up a little bit today on a pit call, but we made up for it. Hard racing today, man. It was crazy, the side-by-side action we got here. The track’s kind of widening out, lending itself to some cool action.”After a restart on Lap 116, the race unraveled for Logano and Harvick. As the two drivers fought for the lead in Turn 3, with Logano to the outside, Harvick’s Chevrolet got loose and washed up the track into Logano’s Ford.The right rear of Logano’s Ford brushed the outside wall, but both drivers were able to continue, albeit after losing several positions. Harvick finished sixth, and Logano, who led a race-high 54 laps came home seventh.Harvick took responsibility for the incident.“I just got loose underneath him,�� Harvick said. “I had a huge run down the back straightaway. That late in the race, I figured I need to try to win the race, and I got in there, and he was on the outside of me, but it was too late to not have contact at that point.“So totally my fault. I just got loose under him going for the win.”Harvick’s mea culpa was little consolation for Logano, who had the race’s dominant car for most of the day.“We were racing for a win here, and it just seems like he drove in there pretty hard trying to slide me,�� Logano said. “I drove up in there, too, and he got loose underneath me and got into my left rear and up we both went into the race track.“It’s unfortunate. I had a fast Discount Tire Ford, obviously the winning car, leading a ton of laps and up there at the end of the race. I was racing hard, and he just drove over his head a little bit.”Despite his runner-up finish, Elliott left Michigan disappointed he couldn’t find a way to keep Busch behind him in the closing laps.“I’ll be honest -- second does not feel good, to me at least,�� Elliott said. “I thought we had a car good enough to compete today. ... We finally got ourselves in position there. We had two even-numbered restarts where we were six and fourth (in the preferred outside lane) that put us in position there to have an opportunity on that last restart.“Obviously, the 22 (Logano) would have been really hard to beat, and Kevin got into him by accident and moved him up the race track. Obviously, that opened up our opportunity to have a shot at the win. ... (Kyle) is really good at what he does, and I don’t really have an excuse for it. So, yeah, he outran me.”Kyle Larson finished third, followed by Chris Buescher, who extended his series lead to 25 points over Ty Dillon, who came home 13th.

LOS ANGELES, Nov 20 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is banking on American consumers�� desire for something different from cars and crossover utility vehicles to drive demand for its Chevrolet Colorado when the mid-sized pickup trucks re-enter the U.S. market next autumn.As part of the No. 1 U.S. automaker’s so-called “three-truck strategy�� that includes the full-size and heavy-duty Chevy Silverado pickups, the 2015 Colorado and its GMC sibling Canyon are meant to appeal to lifestyle buyers much like Subaru has done with its vehicles, offering space, utility and a refined interior.GM believes the Colorado redux, which will debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday, will be far more successful than its last appearance when U.S. sales peaked in 2005 above 128,000. However, declining popularity and the company’s need to save money during its 2009 bankruptcy reorganization forced it to exit the U.S. market last year.GM, which never stopped selling the Colorado overseas, envisions a profitable return in a segment that was abandoned by its U.S. rivals, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group .“We honestly believe from all the research that we’ve done that there’s a lot of people looking for mid-size�� trucks, Alan Batey, GM’s global Chevy chief told reporters ahead of the relaunch. “What happened in the segment was there wasn’t a lot of choice.”Research firm IHS Automotive, however, does not see sales as strong as GM does, predicting 100,000 annually in the U.S. market from the Colorado and Canyon combined.“The gap in pricing between Silverado and Colorado will be key,�� IHS senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. “If price gets too close or fuel economy is not better by at least five to six miles per gallon on the highway, that will hurt the Colorado.“The real question is how many people are really sitting in small crossovers wishing they had trucks,�� she added. “We don’t know the answer, but GM is betting on that.”It may be difficult to imagine in a market where full-sized trucks like Silverado, Ford’s F-150 and Chrysler’s Ram dominate television ads with images of brawny, haul-anything usefulness, but the mid-sized trucks once rivaled their larger siblings.In 1994, U.S. sales of the smaller pickups topped out at almost 1.2 million vehicles, or 8 percent of the market, compared with more than 1.6 million, or 10.7 percent of the market, for the full-size trucks. Last year, however, small pickups, mostly the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier, accounted for fewer than 280,000 sales, or 1.9 percent of the market, while the bigger trucks made up more than 11 percent.Industry sales in the U.S. mid-sized truck market fell 7.5 percent last year and are expected to slide another 12.7 percent this year, but rebound to almost 395,000 vehicles in 2020, according to research firm LMC Automotive.GM is betting the Colorado can top its peak U.S. sales year with demand coming not only from existing players in the mid-sized truck segment, but from the larger trucks of its rivals as well as crossover buyers looking for something different.Competitors are watching. Toyota Motor Corp claims GM’s re-entry will only boost the segment and sales of its market-leading Tacoma.Bill Fay, group vice president for Toyota’s U.S. sales, said they have been anticipating the Colorado’s return. “More entries create more shoppers. A lot of that will make some people come take a look at Tacoma,�� he added.Fay said Toyota remains committed to the segment and he sees sales of Tacoma, last redesigned in 2004, rising over the next several years from the 141,000-plus sold last year. He agreed, however, that Toyota will likely need to increase advertising for its truck ahead of Colorado’s debut.Meanwhile, Ford shows no signs of swerving from its strategy of maximizing sales of the F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. market for more than three decades. Ford and Chrysler stopped making their mid-sized trucks, the Ranger and Dakota respectively, in 2011.“I’m not exactly sure what they see that we’re not seeing.�� Doug Scott, Ford’s truck group marketing manager, said of GM. “We’ll just have to see how things play out.”Ford officials added they have no plans to bring the Ranger, still sold overseas, back to the U.S. market as the proximity of that vehicle’s size to the full-size F-150 makes it unnecessary. They also said the smaller pickups appealed in the early 1990s partly as an option to entry-level cars because the trucks could be purchased with sub-$100 monthly leases. That is no longer true.Instead, Ford is boosting efforts to broaden its F-150 lineup. For instance, the sportier STX version, meant to appeal to younger buyers - launched as a distinct model in 2009 - is expected to make up 17 percent of the truck’s sales mix over the next year, up from 3 percent in the 2012 model year, Scott said.Colorado’s starting price the last time around was $18,285, and while it has not revealed what it will now be, the lack of a regular cab model suggests it could be higher. However, the Detroit automaker has to be careful to keep it separate from the larger Silverado, which starts at $26,670. Ford’s F-150 starts at $25,640.GM executives feel they made the new Colorado different enough from Silverado. A comparable crew cab version of Colorado is 900 pounds lighter, 16 inches shorter, 5 inches narrower and 3 inches lower. It will be offered with 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, and V6 engines in the first year, with a diesel engine added in the second year.	-5.791352638
TOKYO, April 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has been offered $146.5 million of tax breaks from the State of Kentucky to add production capacity to build a new model from 2015 at its Georgetown plant, already the Japanese automaker’s biggest U.S. factory.The offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority in a preliminary approval published Wednesday comes as Toyota’s president, Akio Toyoda and Jim Lentz, the manufacturer’s head in North America, prepare to make an announcement on U.S. production on Friday.Expanding output at the Kentucky facility, which is operated by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky Inc., would fit with the automaker’s strategy of adding capacity at existing plants rather than break ground at new locations. Toyota had previously said it would freeze plans for any new plants for the next three years.The tax incentives being offered by Kentucky would be spread over 10 years on an estimated investment of $531 million, creating 750 new jobs, according to a copy of the preliminary approval.Toyota plans to make its luxury ES Lexus in Kentucky, Japan’s leading financial daily, the Nikkei, reported earlier, without saying where it obtained the information. Toyota declined to comment on the report.The flagship luxury vehicle, which Toyota does not sell at home, is currently only made at Kyushu plant in Japan. It was the second most popular Lexus model in the United States after the RX SUV in 2012.When the new ES went on sale last year, Toyota executive Kazuo Ohara said Toyota was aiming to sell about 10,000 ES vehicles a month, including 5,000 in the United States and 3,000 in China. Overall, Toyota wants to sell about 500,000 Lexus vehicles globally in 2013, 23,000 more than last year.The boost to the Georgetown plant underscores an improvement in the carmaker’s fortunes in the key U.S. market where it has been buffeted by recalls, litigation and upcoming rivals, such South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co out to grab its market share. The company’s sales rose 27 percent in the United States last year and 9 percent in the first three months of 2013 compared to the same period last year.Toyota and other Japanese automakers have been pushing to increase production of vehicles in the markets where they sell them to counter a strong yen that had made exporting from Japan expensive. The yen’s decline since late last year has not changed that strategy.Toyota’s 500,000 vehicle-capacity Kentucky plant makes the Camry sedan, its best-selling model in the United States, as well as the Avalon sedan and Venza crossover. It also makes hybrid variants of the Camry and Avalon, which share the same platform as the Lexus ES.	14.60003563
* Q4 op profit 118.1 bln yen vs consensus 120 bln yen* Sees 2012/13 operating profit up 28 pct* Sales momentum seen strong with product offensive* Expects to beat industry with record sales this yearBy Chang-Ran KimYOKOHAMA, Japan, May 11 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co posted on Friday a one-third jump in quarterly profit and projected a 28 percent rise in the year ahead driven by brisk sales momentum in most major markets and the launch of 10 new models around the world.Nissan has outshone domestic rivals Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp in the past year as Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn has pushed aggressively into fast-growing markets such as China and Russia.January-March operating profit at Japan’s No.2 automaker rose 33 percent to 118.1 billion yen ($1.48 billion), against an average estimate of 120 billion yen from 20 analysts polled in the past 90 days by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net profit for Nissan’s fourth-quarter grew 145 percent to 75.3 billion yen.For the year to next March, Nissan projected an operating profit of 700 billion yen - the best since the global financial crisis - and net profit of 400 billion yen. Consensus forecasts from 26 analysts put the profit at 710.5 billion yen.Nissan, valued at $44 billion and 43.4 percent-held by France’s Renault SA, has also recovered its supply chain faster than its competitors after last year’s earthquake and tsunami and widespread flooding in Thailand. It has also been more ruthless in replacing more of the parts for the cars it makes in Japan with imported components, taking advantage of the strong yen.The automaker’s global sales grew 16 percent to a record 4.845 million vehicles in the business year ended March, handily beating the total industry’s 4.2 percent rise.Ghosn told a news conference Nissan expects to beat the industry again this business year with a sales increase of 10.4 percent to another record, of 5.35 million vehicles.“As we start the new year, Nissan stands as a company re-tooled and ready to accelerate its growth,�� he said.“Together with a stronger brand, investments in products, technologies and global capacity, we have the tools to achieve Nissan Power 88 and beyond,�� he said, referring to Nissan’s six-year growth plan that aims to achieve an 8 percent global market share and 8 percent operating profit margin by March 2017.Nissan is planning to launch 10 all-new models in the year ahead, including the high-volume Altima sedan and Pathfinder sports utility.For the year to end-March, Nissan managed a slight rise, of 1.6 percent, in operating profit to 545.84 billion yen, compared with a 60 percent decline at Honda and 24 percent drop at Toyota.Ghosn repeated Nissan’s aim of becoming the top Asian automaker in China, Brazil and Russia, markets in which all global automakers are aiming to grab a bigger pie.In Russia, Renault-Nissan last week signed a long-awaited deal that would give them effective control of Lada maker AvtoVAZ, creating a group that would rank third in global sales behind General Motors Co and Volkswagen , and ahead of Toyota.But Ghosn stressed that BRICs countries were not the only fast-growing markets, adding that automakers would be at risk if they did not pay attention to newly emerging markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam and pockets of Africa and the Middle East.Nissan shares are up more than 12 percent year-to-date, about half the increase Toyota has seen, and lagging Honda’s 16 percent gain.Nissan ended up 3.3 percent in Tokyo before the results were announced.	-6.343699665
JAKARTA (Reuters) - SoftBank has offered to invest up to $40 billion in the new capital city Indonesia plans to build on Borneo island, a minister said on Friday, though the Japanese tech conglomerate said no figure had been suggested yet.Indonesian President Joko Widodo announced in August plans to move the administrative capital to East Kalimantan province, on Borneo, to relieve Jakarta from “a heavy burden�� due to overcrowding and pollution.Indonesia has previously put the cost of moving the capital at $33 billion, but Luhut Pandjaitan, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment, said Softbank Group Corp had offered up to $40 billion.“So we’ll negotiate over the structure (of the investment). It could amount to $30-40 billion,�� he told reporters.A spokeswoman for SoftBank said the group had not suggested specific numbers, echoing comments by CEO and founder Masayoshi Son last week.“We’re not discussing the specific numbers yet, but a new smart city, newest technology, clean city, with a lot of AI (artificial intelligence), that’s what I’m interested in supporting,�� Son said during a visit to Jakarta last week.Pandjaitan said he would discuss the potential investment further with Son further on Monday at the World Economic Forum gathering in the Swiss resort of Davos and that President Joko Widodo will likely decide on the agreement in February.Widodo said on Thursday that a planned sovereign wealth fund to finance infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy will raise at least $20 billion once established, though Pandjaitan said it was still under discussion whether investment would be channeled through the sovereign wealth fund.Widodo discussed plans to establish the fund with Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nahyan last weekend during an official visit to the United Arab Emirates.Sovereign wealth funds are typically used by countries to direct funds from resource wealth such as oil, though Indonesia also plans to invite foreign investment into its fund.To help attract investment, Indonesia has asked Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Softbank’s Son to advise on plans to move the capital, ministers have said.Planning minister Suharso Monoarfa said this week that Softbank was interested in providing self-driving vehicles for the capital.In June, the self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank and Toyota Motor said it plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia this year.	-2.107037505

DETROIT (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are taking on Detroit’s Big Three and scrambling to expand their share of pickup truck sales in the United States, as record low gasoline prices curb demand for their once best-selling small and medium-sized sedans.Soaring demand for SUVs and pickup trucks drove U.S. auto sales to a record high last year, as the lowest fuel prices in seven years prompted a shift from sedans and smaller cars to larger vehicles in the world’s biggest auto market.The big U.S. automakers - Ford Motor Co F.N, General Motors Co GM.N and Chrysler FCAU.N - have so far gained the most from this shift, with many selling pickups at luxury car prices.Faced with slowing demand growth for smaller models including the Civic, the Camry and the Altima, Japanese automakers such as Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T now want in, launching beefed up models at the Detroit auto show this week.“We’re looking for 5 percent share of the full-sized pickup truck segment,�� Nissan North America Chairman Jose Munoz said at the Detroit auto show this week, citing a figure that dwarfs Nissan’s roughly 0.6 percent market share of the full-sized pickup segment last year.The automaker launched a hulking concept design for its Titan XD pickup model at the event.While Japanese automakers have steadily grown their share of the SUV and crossover markets, their share of the higher-margin truck market was 14.7 percent in 2015, according to automotive researcher Kelley Blue Book, down from 20.5 percent in 2007.Regaining market share will be tough, however, as many truck buyers tend to remain loyal to U.S. models, senior analyst Karl Brauer said, but the Japanese automakers still have a chance.“If volumes continue to rise they could take some new share as new buyers to the segment might be open to models by overseas makers,�� Brauer said, adding that recently launched new models could help the Japanese brands.In a bid to attract truck buyers, Toyota last year launched a redesigned version of its Tacoma compact pickup.Honda also said this week that it would soon launch the first revamp of its Ridgeline mid-sized pick up in a decade and which would target the “tail-gating�� crowd which hold parties in parking lots. The vehicle offers features such as audio speakers in the load bed and beer-cooler-sized well under the bed floor, features many rival trucks don’t have.	-6.948146874
DETROIT (Reuters) - Automakers and lawmakers expressed hope on Tuesday that U.S. Congress would soon pass a stalled bill aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, even as safety advocates argued for more performance requirements.The U.S. House of Representatives in September unanimously approved a bill to quickly allow self-driving cars without human controls on roads. A Senate committee approved similar legislation in October, but did not act before the end of 2017 after some Democrats raised concerns.At the Detroit auto show, which featured companies that are aggressively pursuing self-driving technologies, members of Congress and automakers acknowledged it could take several months or longer for the bill to be approved by the U.S. Senate and signed into law, but said it had strong support.“There isn’t much legislative time this year,�� said Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, in an interview on the sidelines of the auto show. “It just needs to get done.”General Motors Co, Waymo owner Alphabet Inc, Toyota Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation.The Senate bill would allow automakers to each sell up to 80,000 self-driving vehicles annually within three years if they demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles. Auto safety advocates complain the bill lacks sufficient safeguards.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade association representing, GM, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota and others, urged speedy action. “Delays in passing legislation are really delays in lives saved and in access to mobility for the disabled,�� the group said on Tuesday.GM said last week it would seek government approval under current law to deploy up to 2,500 vehicles without steering wheels and brake pedals.Walden and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said it is important that the United States maintain a lead on self-driving technology, reduce the more than 37,000 annual traffic deaths and avoid conflicting state rules.The bill grants U.S. regulators authority to exempt vehicles from federal safety requirements and requires a determination within six months of an automaker request.Some Democrats have concerns, noting the measure would bar states from being able to test self-driving vehicles as they do prospective human drivers.“The car is not going to have to take a test,�� said former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) chief Joan Claybrook said at a Detroit forum, arguing that the bill should require binding performance requirements for cybersecurity and vehicle electronics.She said in an interview that the proposed exemption policy is “ridiculous�� and the law should bar automakers from seeking exemptions from crash worthiness standards.Peters said states could still regulate self-driving cars, including by determining where they could be used and limiting their allowed travel speed.��(Automakers) have to check a lot of boxes to make sure these cars are safe,�� he said.	-3.212052302

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s industrial output rose 3.6 percent in March, rebounding from a big drop logged in the prior month, government data showed on Thursday, in a tentative sign of a pick-up in factory activity.The result compared with the median estimate of a 2.9 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists.It followed a revised 5.2 percent drop in February, hurt by the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia and Toyota Motor Corp’s temporary halting of factory output due to an explosion at a steel plant.Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 2.6 percent in April and decline 2.3 percent in May.	0.4370629371
LONDON (Reuters) - Fernando Alonso can win this month’s Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race on his debut with Toyota but the double Formula One world champion could still be in the wrong car, according to five-times winner Derek Bell.The 76-year-old, one of the greats of endurance racing and a double sportscar world champion, told Reuters that Le Mans was a race that chose its winners.“He should win, and Toyota should win, but we’ve had that many times before,�� Bell said at a Motorsport Hall of Fame event.“I drove for Renault when we led by 16 laps at eight o’clock in the morning and by quarter to nine we were out.“That’s racing and it’s tough as heck. But they (Toyota) have put everything into it and I just pray and hope they haven’t got something silly that goes wrong.”Alonso is the big name at the Sarthe circuit this year, even if Le Mans is always a team effort, and is combining a full Formula One season for McLaren with the World Endurance Championship (WEC) for Toyota.He wants to become only the second man, after the late Briton Graham Hill, to complete the ‘Triple Crown of Motorsport�� by winning Le Mans, the Indianapolis 500 and Formula One championship/Monaco Grand Prix.The 36-year-old led at Indianapolis last year before retiring with an engine failure.Alonso won on his WEC debut, the Six Hours of Spa in Belgium in a car shared with Japan’s Kazuki Nakajima and Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi, and was fastest in last Sunday’s official Le Mans testing.Bell was not at all surprised.“He should be (fastest), shouldn’t he?. He’s good. There’s no doubt about it. The good ones always go quick,�� he said. “I didn’t expect anything different.“Without a doubt, the biggest publicity is Alonso being at Le Mans. So if they can get him in the car and give him the works just to get the quickest lap, they will do it.”Toyota are the only major manufacturer entered in the endurance classic, following the departure of champions Porsche, and are bidding to become only the second Japanese entry to win after Mazda in 1991.The team secured pole position with a record fastest lap last year but had their hopes dashed in an agonizing half hour after midnight when their top two cars retired.Bell jokingly suggested Toyota might have to “retire rapidly back to Japan and never appear again�� if they failed again but racing was a cruel sport.“I wish them all the very best. But they’ve got to win, and they probably will. But they might not. It’s such a lottery,�� said the man who took four of his Le Mans wins with Porsche.A newly-published book ‘All My Porsche Races�� chronicles that history and he will be back at Le Mans again this year for the June 16-17 race.“Don’t forget, it’s 3,000 plus miles, there’s all the traffic out there, there’s the weather conditions, there’s driver ability and traffic in the dark and rain which he (Alonso) hasn’t totally experienced to any great degree,�� said Bell.“And then you get out there and Lady Luck comes in and knocks you about.“It’s in the lap of the gods. It’s Toyota’s time to win but I don’t envy them that.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The government on Tuesday nominated Toyoaki Nakamura, a Hitachi Ltd 6501.T executive, to join the Bank of Japan's nine-member policy board.Nakamura, 67, would replace Yukitoshi Funo, a former executive of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T who has consistently voted with the majority and holds a neutral policy stance.If formally approved by parliament, Nakamura would begin his five-year term on July 1, as Funo serves out his term a day before.Nakamura will fill a post traditionally reserved for a business executive on the BOJ board, which is comprised of academics, economists, career bureaucrats and senior officials from the finance and corporate sectors.Board members who hailed from the corporate sector in the past tended to vote with the majority of the board.Nakamura will join the BOJ at a time the central bank is battling strong economic headwind from the coronavirus outbreak with a dwindling policy toolkit.The BOJ eased monetary policy in an emergency meeting on Monday, joining global central banks in combating the economic fallout from the epidemic.The central bank’s board is currently split between those who see room to increase stimulus, and those more worried about the rising cost of prolonged easing such as the hit to banks�� profit from years of ultra-low interest rates.	2.472874085

PARIS (Reuters) - France’s five times world rally champion Sebastien Ogier was heading for victory on home soil after extending his lead in Corsica on Saturday.The M-Sport driver led Toyota’s Estonian Ott Tanak by 44.5 seconds after Britain’s Kris Meeke, who was second overnight for Citroen, crashed out of the second leg after mis-hearing a pace note.Hyundai’s Belgian Thierry Neuville was third, 0.1 seconds further back, with the asphalt Rallye de France’s longest stage -- a 55km stretch from Vero to Sarrola-Carcopino -- yet to come before the finish on Sunday.Ogier, winner in Monte Carlo and Mexico, leads the championship after three rounds by four points from Neuville, last year’s winner in Corsica.“Anything can always happen but I don’t take the extra risk and I feel like I’m still in control,�� said Ogier.“I feel comfortable, but if someone says they are 100 percent in control they’re lying.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co sold a record number of Chevrolet Volt sedans in August �� but that probably isn’t a good thing for the automaker’s bottom line.Nearly two years after the introduction of the path-breaking plug-in hybrid, GM is still losing as much as $49,000 on each Volt it builds, according to estimates provided to Reuters by industry analysts and manufacturing experts. GM on Monday issued a statement disputing the estimates.Cheap Volt lease offers meant to drive more customers to Chevy showrooms this summer may have pushed that loss even higher. There are some Americans paying just $5,050 to drive around for two years in a vehicle that cost as much as $89,000 to produce.And while the loss per vehicle will shrink as more are built and sold, GM is still years away from making money on the Volt, which will soon face new competitors from Ford, Honda and others.GM’s basic problem is that “the Volt is over-engineered and over-priced,�� said Dennis Virag, president of the Michigan-based Automotive Consulting Group.And in a sign that there may be a wider market problem, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi have been struggling to sell their electric and hybrid vehicles, though Toyota’s Prius models have been in increasing demand.GM’s quandary is how to increase sales volume so that it can spread its estimated $1.2-billion investment in the Volt over more vehicles while reducing manufacturing and component costs - which will be difficult to bring down until sales increase.But the Volt’s steep $39,995 base price and its complex technology �� the car uses expensive lithium-polymer batteries, sophisticated electronics and an electric motor combined with a gasoline engine �� have kept many prospective buyers away from Chevy showrooms.Some are put off by the technical challenges of ownership, mainly related to charging the battery. Plug-in hybrids such as the Volt still take hours to fully charge the batteries - a process that can be speeded up a bit with the installation of a $2,000 commercial-grade charger in the garage.The lack of interest in the car has prevented GM from coming close to its early, optimistic sales projections. Discounted leases as low as $199 a month helped propel Volt sales in August to 2,831, pushing year-to-date sales to 13,500, well below the 40,000 cars that GM originally had hoped to sell in 2012.Out in the trenches, even the cheap leases haven’t always been effective.A Chevrolet dealership that is part of an auto dealer group in Toms River, New Jersey, has sold only one Volt in the last year, said its president Adam Kraushaar. The dealership sells 90 to 100 Chevrolets a month.The weak sales are forcing GM to idle the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant that makes the Chevrolet Volt for four weeks from September 17, according to plant suppliers and union sources. It is the second time GM has had to call a Volt production halt this year.GM acknowledges the Volt continues to lose money, and suggests it might not reach break even until the next-generation model is launched in about three years.“It’s true, we’re not making money yet�� on the Volt, said Doug Parks, GM’s vice president of global product programs and the former Volt development chief, in an interview. The car “eventually will make money. As the volume comes up and we get into the Gen 2 car, we’re going to turn (the losses) around,�� Parks said.“I don’t see how General Motors will ever get its money back on that vehicle,�� countered Sandy Munro, president of Michigan-based Munro &amp; Associates, which performs detailed tear-down analyses of vehicles and components for global manufacturers and the U.S. government.It currently costs GM “at least�� $75,000 to build the Volt, including development costs, Munro said. That’s nearly twice the base price of the Volt before a $7,500 federal tax credit provided as part of President Barack Obama’s green energy policy.Other estimates range from $76,000 to $88,000, according to four industry consultants contacted by Reuters. The consultants�� companies all have performed work for GM and are familiar with the Volt’s development and production. They requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their auto industry ties.Parks declined to comment on specific costs related to the Volt.In its Monday response, GM said the Reuters estimate was “grossly wrong,�� but again declined to provide specific figures.GM said it allocates development costs across the lifetime volume of the program. Reuters calculated the per-vehicle development costs based on the number of Volts sold through the end of August.(For the full GM statement: link.reuters.com/myw52t)The independent cost estimates obtained by Reuters factor in GM’s initial investment in development of the Volt and its key components, as well as new tooling for battery, stamping, assembly and supplier plants �� a price tag that totals “a little over�� $1 billion, Parks said. Independent estimates put it at $1.2 billion, a figure that does not include sales, marketing and related corporate costs.Spread out over the 21,500 Volts that GM has sold since the car’s introduction in December 2010, the development and tooling costs average just under $56,000 per car. That figure will, of course, come down as more Volts are sold.The actual cost to build the Volt is estimated to be an additional $20,000 to $32,000 per vehicle, according to Munro and the other industry consultants.The production cost estimates are considerably higher than those for the Chevrolet Cruze, the Volt’s conventional gasoline-engine sister car, which Munro estimates at $12,000 to $15,000 per vehicle.Production costs typically include such items as parts, material, labor and the cost to run the factory, according to manufacturing expert Ron Harbour, who heads the North American Automotive Practice at Michigan-based consultant Oliver Wyman.The Volt costs more to build for several reasons, mostly related to the car’s richer content, complex technology and still-low sales and production volumes.The basic model has a higher level of equipment and features than the Cruze, which is assembled in Lordstown, Ohio, and has a starting sales price of $17,925. The Volt also has a number of unique parts, including the battery pack, the electric motor and the power electronics.Some of GM’s suppliers also impose cost penalties on the automaker because the Volt’s production volume remains well below projections.Still, as the company wrestles with how to drive down costs and increase showroom traffic, Parks said the Volt is an important car for GM in other respects.“It wasn’t conceived as a way to make tons of money,�� he said. “It was a big dip in the technology pool for GM. We’ve learned a boatload of stuff that we’re deploying on other models,�� Parks said. Those include the Cruze and such future cars as the 2014 Cadillac ELR hybrid.The same risky strategy �� gambling on relatively untested technology �� drove massive investments by Toyota Motor Corp in the Prius hybrid and Nissan Motor Co in the Leaf electric car.Toyota said it now makes a profit on the Prius, which was introduced in the United States in 2000 and is now in its third generation. Sales of the Prius hybrid, which comes in four different versions priced as low as $19,745, have almost doubled so far this year to 164,408.Other such vehicles haven’t done nearly as well. Nissan’s pure-electric Leaf, which debuted at the same time as the Volt and retails for $36,050, has sold just 4,228 this year, while the Honda Insight, which has the lowest starting price of any hybrid in the U.S. at $19,290, has sales this year of only 4,801. The Mitsubishi i, an even smaller electric car priced from $29,975, is in even worse shape, with only 403 sales.Toyota’s unveiling of the original Prius caught U.S. automakers off guard. GM, then under the leadership of Rick Wagoner and Bob Lutz, decided it needed a “leapfrog�� product to tackle Toyota and unveiled the Volt concept to considerable fanfare at the 2007 Detroit auto show.The car entered production in the fall of 2010 as the first U.S. gasoline-electric hybrid that could be recharged by plugging the car into any electrical outlet. The Obama administration, which engineered a $50-billion taxpayer rescue of GM from bankruptcy in 2009 and has provided more than $5 billion in subsidies for green-car development, praised the Volt as an example of the country’s commitment to building more fuel-efficient cars.GM’s investment in the Volt has so far been a fraction of the $5 billion that Nissan said it is spending to develop and tool global production of the Leaf and its associated technologies and the reported $10 billion or more that Toyota has plowed into the Prius and various derivatives over the past decade.But there will inevitably be more development costs for future generations of GM plug-ins and it could still could be years before GM sells enough Volts to bring the cost down to break even.The average per-car costs for development and tooling will drop as sales volume rises. But GM will need to sell 120,000 Volts before the per-vehicle cost reaches $10,000 �� and that may not occur during the projected five-year life cycle of the first-generation Volt.Parks said the company also is continuously reducing production costs on the current Volt and its successor. “There is a strong push on the cost of the Gen 2 to get the car to make money and to be more affordable . . . Virtually every component in the next-gen car is going to be cheaper,�� he said.One obvious way to pull down costs is to push up volume �� but GM is paying a hefty price to do so.The automaker just ended a special Volt lease program that offered customers a low monthly payment of $279 a month for two years, with some high-volume dealers dropping the payment to $199 a month after receiving incentive money from GM, with down payments as low as $250. The company said about two-thirds of Volt customers in July and August leased their vehicles, compared with about 40 percent earlier this year.Before GM resorted to discounting Volt leases, sales were averaging just over 1,500 cars a month. A huge part of that reason was consumer push back over the price, according to Virag of Automotive Consulting.Volt’s nearest competitor, the Prius, is priced at $24,795, with a newer version, the Prius Plug-In, starting at $32,795.Parks said the sales pitch for the Volt was “difficult�� because of the sticker price and the car’s technical complexity. But the discounted leases have helped lure more non-GM buyers into Chevy showrooms. Their number-one trade-in: Toyota Prius.Raymond Chevrolet, in suburban Chicago, sells an average 1,000 Chevys a month, including three to seven Volts. Dealership president Mark Scarpelli said that “some people who like the concept of an electric vehicle find it cost-prohibitive.��	-8.801566899

* Up to 440 jobs to go at plants in Melbourne, Geelong* Daily production will be cut by 29 percent* Ford has lost market share as sales of Falcon model slide* Government gave aid to Ford in JanuaryBy Victoria ThiebergerMELBOURNE, July 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co’s Australian unit announced plans on Tuesday to cut up to 440 jobs, or about 15 percent of its workforce, and slash production by almost 30 percent to cope with a slide in popularity of its top model, the Falcon.Australian car manufacturers have enjoyed solid sales over the past year despite a subdued economy, although Ford’s sales have lagged, according to industry figures.The Ford Falcon was once Australia’s top-selling vehicle but now barely makes it into the top-20, hurt by a trend away from large-engine sedans in favour of small cars and sport utility vehicles, including Ford’s locally made 4WD Territory.Ford said it would cut production from 209 vehicles per day to 148 vehicles per day from November 2012 in a response to changing customer preferences, which have driven an industry-wide decline in the sale of large vehicles.“Implementing this structural change is essential to ensure the longer-term health of the business,�� Ford Australia President Bob Graziano said in a statement.He said most of the up to 440 job losses would be from the manufacturing operations in Melbourne and nearby Geelong in Victoria state. Last year, Ford cut 240 local jobs.Ford said it would shift production to a more profitable mix, including more Territory vehicles.Ford, which has more than 3,000 employees in Australia, in January secured more than A$34 million ($35 million) in funding from state and federal governments to guarantee local production until 2016.In April, the car maker introduced a four-cylinder Falcon model alongside its six- and eight-cylinder versions, hoping to win back corporate and government fleet buyers after a 24 percent slump in Falcon sales year-on-year.Ford’s market share slipped to fifth place, or 7.9 percent, for the year to June, compared with 9.1 percent a year earlier, according to the Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries.Ford trailed Toyota, General Motors�� Holden unit, Mazda and Hyundai.Ford’s Australian subsidiary was founded in 1925 in Geelong and initially assembled Model Ts in a disused woolstore.Australian car makers have also lost market share as sales of imports have surged, aided by the strong Australian dollar. In April, Toyota Motor Corp cut 350 jobs from its manufacturing plant in Melbourne.	8.473906168
TOKYO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Toyota Motor Corp gained 1.6 percent on Thursday on relief that its proposal to pay $1.1 billion to settle U.S. class-action litigation claims over unintentional acceleration in its vehicles was smaller than expected.Toyota said it would take a one-time pretax charge of $1.1 billion to cover the estimated costs of the settlement, court filings showed, as the carmaker looks to turn the page on the biggest safety crisis in its history.Problems with unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles led to a series of recalls between 2009 and 2011, leading the firm to pull back more than 10 million vehicles worldwide and denting its reputation for quality.The settlement terms include a $250 million fund for former Toyota owners who sold vehicles at reduced prices because of bad publicity, and a separate $250 million fund for owners not eligible for the brake override system.“My initiate reaction would be ��that’s it�� ... $1 billion charge that covers recalls and everything else and you are looking at a $250 million compensation fund, that’s nothing,�� a senior trader at a foreign brokerage said.The trader added that it removed the uncertainty hanging over Toyota’s share price.Toyota shares gained 1.6 percent to 3,890 yen in midmorning trade. The stock has risen 51.7 percent this year, outpacing a 36.5 percent gain in the Topix’s transport equipment subindex , home to Toyota and other automakers.Adding to positive sentiment for Toyota shares was the carmaker’s announcement the previous day that it expects to achieve record-high groupwide global sales and production in calendar year 2012. Groupwide figures include Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd.A sharply weaker yen also buoyed hopes that the company’s earnings will be better than expected.While Toyota has assumed an average exchange rate of 79 yen to the dollar for the fiscal year ending in March 2013, the yen fell to 85.78 to the dollar on Thursday, a more than two-year low, after Japan’s new prime minister vowed to weaken the currency and implement aggressive economic stimulus.	2.420574887
NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - A pact on pollution between California and four of the world’s top automakers cuts through the smog from Washington, D.C. America’s largest state by population and economic output on Thursday unveiled a deal to reduce vehicle emissions with BMW, Ford Motor, Honda Motor and Volkswagen. It effectively sidelines an intransigent White House, aligns more closely with overseas standards and offers some handy incentives to boot.Transportation accounts for almost a third of all greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Internal combustion engines have been getting more efficient, but in 2012 former President Barack Obama decided to speed up the process by demanding each automaker boost its fleet’s average mileage to almost 47 miles per gallon by 2025. His successor, President Donald Trump, wants to freeze that at the 2020 target of 37 mpg. He also wants to remove the Golden State’s ability to set its own enforceable targets, arguing only the federal government should have such power.Thursday’s deal provides a neat bypass. It allows automakers to voluntarily accept California’s emissions policies. The pact’s emissions standards apply to the companies�� nationwide fleets, and will also encompass the 13 other states that had already adopted California’s policies. In return, the four manufacturers get an extra year, until 2026, to meet Sacramento’s tailpipe-gas targets compared with the Obama-era ruling.Those are more in line with what a number of European countries as well as China are pushing for. That ought to reduce compliance and development costs, boosting both progress on low-carbon propulsion systems as well as profitability.The signatories also will receive incentives ranging from emissions credits to faster approvals of pollution-reducing technology. That might put only a small dent in the almost $110 billon the four have committed to developing electric vehicles, according to Reuters estimates, but every little bit helps.They may also be joined by more of their peers. Just last month 17 automakers, including California’s gang of four, implored Trump in a letter to find a compromise on emissions that “all parties could support �� including California.�� The more who sign up �� not least General Motors and Toyota Motor, the two largest sellers of new cars in the country �� the better the results for the environment and the auto industry’s bottom line.	-0.8866995074
DETROIT (Reuters) - Global automakers on Monday urged the Trump administration not to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement and expressed hope the United States, Canada and Mexico can successfully conclude a modernized and improved trade pact.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, who announced last week plans to shift heavy pickup truck production from Mexico to Michigan by 2020, said he hoped the Trump administration would “retune�� some of its trade talk demands.Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA, which is heavily utilized by automakers that have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.Marchionne, speaking at a news conference at the Detroit auto show, said FCA’s truck production shift in part “goes a long way I think in addressing some of President Trump’s concerns about the dislocation of production capacity out of the United States.”That decision reduces the risk those trucks would be hit with a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA unravels.Ford Motor Co CEO Jim Hackett on Sunday told reporters NAFTA needs “to be modernized,�� adding that of Detroit’s Big Three automakers, Ford has the highest percentage of U.S.-built vehicles.“We’ve got a big commitment to our country and it’s proven in the numbers,�� he said.Unlike General Motors Co and FCA, Ford does not build trucks in Mexico.GM CEO Mary Barra on Saturday expressed optimism NAFTA will survive with improvements. Other senior GM executives stood by the company’s plans to continue building trucks in Mexico.Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, met with Vice President Mike Pence in December, urging the administration to improve NAFTA instead of terminating it, which could harm the auto industry.“That would be a negative for all three countries,�� Snyder told reporters after touring the auto show.Jose Munoz, head of North American operations for Nissan Motor Co, told Reuters the company has boosted U.S. production in recent years.“No matter what the new NAFTA rules, we will adjust very fast so we can maximize our business,�� he said. “The more localized you are the less exposed you are to potential changes.”Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.The Trump administration has proposed increasing that minimum NAFTA content to 85 percent, with 50 percent made in the United States.The 85 percent North American content proposal to avoid tariffs is unworkable, Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told Reuters.“There’s not a vehicle that meets that,�� he said.Lentz said since NAFTA was agreed 14 auto plants have been built in the United States �� eight by Toyota �� and 11 in Mexico.“It’s not like we are not investing in the United States,�� Lentz said.Marchionne also said the 85 percent figure is not feasible. “I’m hopeful that we’ll see a more rational number going forward and if it is more rational, then I think we’ll be able meet the standard,�� he said.A NAFTA breakup would raise costs, slow demand and put U.S. jobs in jeopardy, Lentz said.Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE brand CEO Herbert Diess said the automaker wasn't preparing for NAFTA's demise.The U.S. auto industry has worked to convince the Trump administration of NAFTA’s importance. In October, major automakers, suppliers and auto dealers launched a coalition to back the agreement.	-1.94969921

* Company focuses on alternative markets as Europe weak* Decision expected by year-end on production of new model* CEO says current lira level reasonable (Adds quotes, details, background)ADAPAZARI, Turkey, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Turkish subsidiary aims to increase output by some 46 percent next year to 150,000 vehicles and focus more on exports across Africa and the Middle East in response to weak European markets, its chief executive said.The production increase, bringing the plant to capacity, will reflect the full-year impact of output of the Corolla passenger car, which it started producing in June, CEO Orhan Ozer told Reuters in an interview.He also said the company expected its Japan head office to decide by the end of the year whether to launch production of a new model in Turkey, but he did not give more details.Turkey’s automotive sector is the country’s largest exporter, with the other major players being Oyak Renault, Ford Otosan and Tofas, all joint ventures between Turkish companies and foreign carmakers.Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey’s plant in Adapazari, northwest Turkey has a capacity of 150,000 vehicles and produces the Verso and new Corolla passenger car models and exports to 52 countries.The group is looking more at export markets in North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia because of weakness in European markets. The auto market in western Europe has had its weakest year in two decades.“I do not see much of a prospect of Europe recovering in the short- and medium-term. This puts exporters in a difficult situation,�� Ozer told Reuters.“In response to this, we expanded to cover North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and other African countries. We increased our exports to these regions with the Corolla.”The Turkish subsidiary aims to produce 67,000 Corolla cars this year, aimed mostly at the Russian, Turkish and Israeli markets. “Kazakhstan in particular is a growing market. Russia and Ukraine is a growing region. These countries are very attractive when you look at the number of vehicles per thousand people,�� he said.But some 90 of its exports of the Verso model are still destined for European countries such as Germany, France and Spain.Turkish automotive exports rose 12 percent in the first nine months of the year to $15.7 billion, with a full-year figure of $21-22 billion expected, according to data from the Automotive Industry Exporters Association.The company expects exports to account for 86-88 percent of its sales this year. Output in the first nine months of the year amounted 67,497 vehicles.The Turkish lira has weakened sharply against the dollar this year due mainly to concerns about the U.S. Federal Reserve reducing its monetary stimulus but it has rebounded in recent weeks. Ozer said the current lira level was reasonable.“As far as exports are concerned this is a factor which strengthens our competitive power. However volatility is the worst thing for exporters,�� he said.“An end-year level of 1.9-2 lira (against the dollar) will be positive for the automotive sector as far as exports are concerned. I think full-year exports to be around $21 billion,�� he said. (Reporting by Evren Ballim, Writing by Ece Toksabay. Editing by Jane Merriman)	-3.120458891
* Toyota expects to sell 2.2 mln vehicles in U.S., best since 2008* Honda aims to break record sales in U.S. in 2013* Toyota certain to regain top global autos sales spotDETROIT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are optimistic about even better sales in the United States this year, helped by a weakening yen and product launch cycles, after posting robust sales last year as they left behind the effects of natural disasters in 2011.Toyota Motor Corp, which on Monday became certain to regain the world’s top sales spot for the first time since 2010, sees for this year the strongest U.S. sales since 2008, an executive told Reuters on Monday.The third-biggest automaker in the United States after GM and Ford is expecting to sell about 2.2 million vehicles this year, up about 6 percent from a year ago, Jim Lentz, the President and Chief Executive of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. said at the Detroit auto show.Honda Motor Co, the No.5 automaker in the United States, is also optimistic about U.S. sales for 2013, aiming to break its record sales of 1.55 million vehicles it had sold back in 2007, Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura said.With strong sales of its key models including the redesigned Accord sedan released in the United States in September, Honda sees a chance to expand in the U.S. and neighboring markets, said Chief Executive Takanobu Ito.“Now is a very good time for us to enhance our presence in North America,�� Ito told reporters.Last year, Japanese firms sold more than 5.3 million vehicles combined in the United States in 2012, up 20 percent from a year ago when it was struggling to recover from natural disasters that disrupted the supply chain. Their combined share rose 2 percentage points to 36.9 percent.Toyota, which has projected its 2012 global vehicle sales at 9.7 million vehicles, on Monday became certain to grab back the title of the world’s best-selling automaker after General Motors said it sold 9.28 million vehicles globally last year. Volkswagen sold 9.07 million vehicles in 2012.The value of the yen, which was at 78 against the dollar in October, has been dropping as Japan’s new Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, pursues a policy mix of bold monetary easing and a big fiscal spending, and was trading at around 89.5 yen on Monday.Toyota, which locally produces about 70 percent of the vehicles sold in North America, said the weakening yen means it could import more vehicles from Japan to the United States, including the luxury Lexus models that are still mostly produced in Japan, as well as hybrids like the Prius that are not produced locally, Lentz said.Meanwhile, Honda, which locally manufactures about 90 percent of its vehicles sold in North America, wants to boost that rate to 95 percent through capacity expansion at its Indiana and Alabama plants as well as its new plant in Mexico, Ito said.Honda unveiled the concept version of the compact car Fit-based SUV at the auto show on Monday. Ito said the SUV is set to go on sale first in Japan in end-2013, followed by the United States, and will be produced in Mexico, as well as in Asia.Mazda Motor Corp said it expects the U.S. market at 15 to 15.5 million vehicles in 2013.“I’m very optimistic on the next several years on the industry, and I’m extremely optimistic knowing what I know for Mazda, for us to be able to outgrow the industry and outpace the industry and certainly return to profitability,�� James O’Sullivan, President and Chief Executive of Mazda North American Operations, told Reuters.Toyota sees the U.S. market size at around 14.7 million vehicles, up from the 14.5 million vehicles in 2012, a conservative assumption compared with Honda that expects the market at 14.8 to 15.3 million vehicles, and Nissan, with a 15.3 million vehicle forecast.	6.439904594
(Repeats story first published on Tuesday with no change to text)SHANGHAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Foreign automakers in China may struggle to dictate sales goals in the future after dealers complained to the government that inflexible targets set during a market boom obliged them to buy too much stock and bear the brunt of a drop in demand.Automakers largely stuck to targets throughout 2014, selling cars to dealers on schedule. But dealers slashed retail prices and booked losses as sales growth in the world’s biggest auto market halved from the previous year’s 14 percent.“Carmakers have high market expectations. But the reality is: supply exceeds demand,�� said Luo Lei, deputy secretary general of the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).“In the past, dealers were angry, but dared not speak out. But now, they have to shout because the situation is getting so unbearable,�� said Luo, whose body this month filed a report with authorities on the practice of transferring stock to dealers.The report from China’s biggest dealer body could help change the balance of power at a time when automakers are starting to alter expectations in an economy expanding near its slowest rate in 24 years.Japan’s Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan Motor Co Ltd cut their China sales forecasts last month while executives say Toyota Motor Corp is likely to miss its 2014 goal. Germany’s BMW said it expects profit margins to narrow as the market “normalises�� from the growth spurt of the past few years.“Carmakers are making a compromise to dealers�� in their worst-ever spat, said Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.“Over the past years, carmakers, especially luxury brands, have been too aggressive in their quest for China market share. Now with the problem fully exposed, I expect to see an obvious slowdown in their pace of expansion next year.”Honda has been helping dealers “adjust�� inventories since the middle of the year, a company spokesman said. Honda’s China sales have fallen every month since July.BMW China head Karsten Engel said in an interview last month that the luxury carmaker had “listened�� to dealers saying stockpiles were building up, and that it had started “reducing wholesale supplies��.The reduction contributed to BMW’s sales growth slowing to 8 percent in the third quarter from over 20 percent in the first half.BMW in a statement said it is in continuous dialogue with dealers about all aspects of business development including targets, and that it is in its interest for dealers to be profitable.In its report to the government, CADA said automakers have “excessive power�� as their targets essentially obligate dealers to buy their cars. That means automakers still earn a profit whereas dealers suffer “rampant losses�� because of an inability to sell excess stock to consumers, CADA said.In separate reports, CADA said 30 percent of dealers profited this year compared with 70 percent in 2010, and that inventories were equivalent to 1.8 times monthly sales, above the “alert line�� of 1.5. A stockpile of 0.8 times to 1.2 times is generally considered healthy, industry analysts say.The Jiangsu Automobile Trade Management Association this month said 30 of 34 FAW Toyota dealerships in the eastern province were losing money, partly because they were obliged to buy a set number of cars from FAW Toyota or face penalty fees.Toyota venture FAW Toyota Motor Sales Co said in a statement posted on the Jiangsu association’s website that it had lowered sales targets and slowed the pace of network expansion in eastern China to protect dealers�� profitability.“For a long period of time, manufacturers have been in a dominant position,�� said Chen Ning, deputy secretary general of the Jiangsu association. “We haven’t yet seen any improvements in dealers�� situation. Many of them are still struggling on the verge of survival.�� (Editing by Christopher Cushing)	2.685686962

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N F-150 Super Cab pickup truck was the only 2016 model large pickup truck to receive a ""top safety pick"" after new tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the agency said on Tuesday.Two pickups built by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU.NFCHA.MI - the Ram 1500 Quad Cab and the Ram 1500 Crew Cab - received marginal overall ratings for their performance in a test designed to simulate what happens when a vehicle strikes a tree or another vehicle with just the driver's side fender. One model made by General Motors Co GM.N and one made by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T also received marginal ratings in the latest round of tests, the IIHS said.Fiat Chrysler said in a statement its vehicles were designed for “real-world performance and no single test determines overall, real-world vehicle safety. Every FCA US vehicle meets or exceeds all applicable motor-vehicle safety standards.”The IIHS is a research arm of the insurance industry, and its crash tests are increasingly influential in guiding vehicle safety design. Automakers strive for top ratings in IIHS tests as they do on federal crash tests.The Ford F-150 went to a lighter-weight aluminum body for the 2015 model year. GM has questioned the strength of aluminum in advertisements, including one showing that people menaced by a bear prefer to be protected by a steel cage rather than an aluminum one.GM declined to comment on the test results.The IIHS said the aluminum-body 2016 Ford F-150 Super Cab was the only pickup that scored an overall “good�� rating in its small overlap crash test.Last year, IIHS tested both versions of the F-150 and found that the extended car SuperCrew tested “good�� while the SuperCab did not. Ford made changes to the SuperCab to win the top truck rating this year, the IIHS said.The extended cab versions of GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra have earned “acceptable�� ratings in the small overlap test, as did Toyota’s Tundra Double Cab model.Toyota said in a statement it is “evaluating the test results with the goal of finding new ways to continuously improve the performance of Toyota trucks and to further enhance the safety of our vehicles.”IIHS said it would test the 2016 models of the Nissan Motor Co 7201.T Titan and the Honda Motor Co 7267.T Ridgeline pickups later this year."	-0.1968891514
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it will invest $600 million in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing as well as a new joint venture as the companies seek to develop connected and electric vehicle technologies in China.The move accelerates a trend in China which has seen automakers launch their own ride-hailing services, and ride-hailing firms such as Didi team with automakers to develop purpose-built cars for their services.It also comes as the auto and communications industries develop the next generation of connected vehicle technologies, including self-driving and so-called vehicle-to-everything technology, with the advancement of 5G network technology.Toyota said the new joint venture would include the Japanese automaker’s Chinese partnership with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (GAC), and would see the companies combining services and technologies to work on fleet management, car maintenance and car rental services.That collaboration will utilize Toyota’s connected technologies and next-generation battery electric vehicles, Toyota’s Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement.Toyota, which has said it aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, has tapped Chinese battery makers including Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) and BYD Co Ltd to aid it in the shift to electricity-powered cars. The move is in line with global regulations and a push among automakers to develop the new-energy vehicle industry.It has also said it would set up a joint venture to develop connected vehicles with Japanese auto parts maker Denso Corp.Toyota and Didi on Thursday did not specify whether their collaboration will involve car design or manufacturing, which is part of Didi’s goal to ultimately develop purpose-built cars for its services.Toyota and Didi have previously teamed up on other vehicle projects and services for Didi drivers.Didi has also set up ventures with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, BYD and BAIC' new-energy vehicle unit.Sources told Reuters in June that Didi was in talks with Nissan Motor Co Ltd and its China partner, Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd, to form another fleet-management venture.A source familiar with the matter also told Reuters that Chinese electric vehicle maker Lixiang, previously known as CHJ, is working with Didi to build a car model for mobility services.	-1.298113208

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s first robot bartender has begun serving up drinks in a Tokyo pub in a test that could usher in a wave of automation in restaurants and shops struggling to hire staff in an aging society.The repurposed industrial robot serves drinks in is own corner of a Japanese pub operated by restaurant chain Yoronotaki. An attached tablet computer face smiles as it chats about the weather while preparing orders.The robot, made by the company QBIT Robotics, can pour a beer in 40 seconds and mix a cocktail in a minute. It uses four cameras to monitors customers to analyze their expressions with artificial intelligence (AI) software.“I like it because dealing with people can be a hassle. With this you can just come and get drunk,�� Satoshi Harada, a restaurant worker said after ordering a drink.“If they could make it a little quicker it would be even better.”Finding workers, especially in Japan’s service sector, is set to get even more difficult.The government has eased visa restrictions to attract more foreign workers but companies still face a labor shortage as the population shrinks and the number of people over 65 increases to more than a third of the total.Service companies that can’t relocate overseas or take advantage of automation are more vulnerable than industrial firms. In health care alone, Japan expects a shortfall of 380,000 workers by 2025.Japan wants to use the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games beginning on July 27 to showcase service robot technology, with organizers planning to use robots built by Toyota Motor and Panasonic Corp to help visitors, workers and athletes.The robot bartender trial at the pub, which employs about 30 people, will last two months after which Yoronotaki will assess the results.“We hope it’s a solution,�� Yoshio Momiya, a Yoronotaki manager, said as the robot bartender served drinks behind him.“There are still a number of issues to work through, such as finding enough space for it, but we hope it will be something we can use.”At about 9 million yen ($82,000), the robot cost as much as employing a human bartender for three years.	-10.30906012

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co expects to recall vehicles with potentially defective air bags, a move that could expand a massive, multi-company air-bag recall by more than a million, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The recall involves faulty air-bag inflators supplied by Takata Corp and would follow a similar move this week by Toyota Motor Corp. The Honda recall should be announced by the end of June, according to the person, who declined to be identified.Honda, while waiting for further information from Takata on its inflator problems, is also investigating on its own how many vehicles it may need to call back and where they are, according to the individual. The number of vehicles it recalls could exceed the 1.135 million vehicles Honda called back globally last year, the person said.Asked whether Honda will expand air-bag-related recalls from last year, company spokeswoman Akemi Ando said: “We are conducting investigations quickly and if we decide that there are vehicles that should be called back, we will swiftly file for a recall.”Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, on Wednesday called back 1.62 million previously recalled vehicles outside Japan as well as 650,000 more in Japan not previously recalled. The additional vehicles brought to more than 7 million the total number of cars equipped with Takata air bags to be called back worldwide over the last five years.Toyota’s recall from 2013 was a part of a bigger recall by car makers that include Honda, Nissan Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp. In total, they recalled about 3.6 million vehicles with air-bag inflators that could explode in an accident and send pieces of shrapnel into the vehicle.Toyota said it has determined that the serial numbers of potentially faulty inflators that Takata previously supplied were incomplete. Takata said it supports Toyota’s decision to recall the vehicles.The Japanese Transport Ministry has ordered car makers including Honda, Nissan and Mazda to determine quickly whether they need to expand their recalls. Mazda spokeswoman Misato Kobayashi declined to say when the company would finish its investigations, while Nissan could not be reached immediately.The U.S. auto industry regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said it had opened an investigation this week into an estimated 1,092,000 vehicles made by not only Toyota, but also Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Fiat SpA’s Chrysler Group after receiving six reports of air bags not deploying properly in the humid climates of Florida and Puerto Rico.	3.948287911

DETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co agreed to pay nearly $17.4 million in a settlement with U.S. auto safety regulators for failing to act quickly enough last year to recall vehicles with a defect that may cause unintended acceleration.Ford and regulators reached the settlement “in order to avoid a protracted dispute and possible litigation,�� according to the settlement document dated June 28. Ford paid the settlement on July 26, according to the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The NHTSA had asked Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, to recall nearly 424,000 Ford Escape sport-utility vehicles with a defect that caused a stuck throttle when the accelerator pedal was fully or almost fully depressed. The Escapes were from the 2001 to 2004 model years.During its investigation, Ford gave NHTSA information that supported “a tentative conclusion�� that the recall may not have been timely, according to the settlement document. That could be a violation of U.S. law.Ford denied that it broke the law. In a statement, Ford stressed that it was committed to responding quickly to potential vehicle issues. The settlement agreement does not release Ford from civil or criminal liabilities.“While we are confident in our current processes for quickly identifying and addressing potential vehicle issues, Ford agreed to this settlement to avoid a lengthy dispute with the government,�� the company said in a statement.The Wall Street Journal first reported the details of the Ford settlement, which is the largest settlement reached so far this year, according to NHTSA records.In December 2012, Toyota Motor Corp agreed to pay almost $17.4 million in a settlement over NHTSA claims that it did not recall 2010 Lexus RS 350s fast enough over an issue of floor mat pedal entrapment.Toyota has reached four separate settlements with NHTSA over the timing of its recalls. The payments exceeded $66 million from 2010 to 2013.	-7.466686518

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada and California on Wednesday said they had signed a memorandum of understanding to advance cleaner vehicles and fuels.The most populous U.S. state and Canada said they will work together “to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles like electric cars�� and share technical information and best practices in regulating cleaner fuels, as California does today though its Low-Carbon Fuel Standard.The announcement comes as the Trump administration has proposed barring California from regulating vehicle emissions or requiring a rising number of zero emission vehicles.Canada is reviewing its vehicle emissions standards. The Trump administration in August 2018 after a similar review proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels, a rollback of standards announced during the Obama administration.The administration plans in the coming months to finalize a dramatic rewrite of fuel efficiency standards through 2026 that would also strip California, which wants stricter rules to fight climate change, of the right to set its own, tougher emissions rules.The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration’s preferred option.Earlier this month, 17 major automakers including General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp urged the White House to resume talks with California to avoid a lengthy legal battle.On Tuesday, four U.S. House lawmakers led by Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan again urged California and the Trump administration to meet to try to reach an agreement to maintain nationwide rules.Canada is working toward having 100% of all light-duty vehicles sold be zero-emissions by 2040. Canada is offering a rebate of up to $5,000 for qualifying zero-emission vehicles and other tax incentives for businesses that want to upgrade to zero-emission fleets.California allocated $238 million in its 2019 budget for incentives to purchase electric and fuel cell vehicles.California’s zero emission rules have been adopted by nine other states and Colorado has said it plans to adopt them. The Trump administration would bar the states from requiring them.California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard went into effect in 2011 and has displaced 3.3 billion gallons of petroleum-based fuels with low-carbon alternatives including renewable diesel, electricity and renewable natural gas.Canada is developing a Clean Fuel Standard that will cut emissions by 30 million tons in 2030 �� equivalent to taking 7 million cars off the road.	6.517344546
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is targeting developing in the next five years driver assistance systems that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) to improve vehicle safety, the head of its advanced research division said.Gill Pratt, CEO of recently set up Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the Japanese automaker’s research and development company that focuses on AI, said it aims to improve car safety by enabling vehicles to anticipate and avoid potential accident situations.Toyota has said the institute will spend $1 billion over the next five years, as competition to develop self-driving cars intensifies.Earlier this month, home rival Honda Motor Co said it was setting up a new research body which would focus on artificial intelligence, joining other global automakers which are investing in robotics research, including Ford and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE. “Some of the things that are in car safety, which is a near-term priority, I’m very confident that we will have some advances come out during the next five years,�� Pratt told reporters late last week in comments embargoed for Monday.The concept of allowing vehicles to think, act and take some control from drivers to perform evasive maneuvers forms a key platform of Toyota’s efforts to produce a car which can drive automatically on highways by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.While currently driver assistance systems largely use image sensors to avoid obstacles including vehicles and pedestrians within the car’s lane, Pratt said TRI was looking at AI solutions to enable “the car to be evasive beyond the one lane��.“The intelligence of the car would figure out a plan for evasive action ... Essentially (it would) be like a guardian angel, pushing on the accelerators, pushing on the steering wheel, pushing on the brake in parallel with you.”As Japanese automakers race against technology companies to develop automated vehicles, they are also grappling with a rapidly graying society, which puts future demand for private vehicle ownership at risk.Pratt said he saw the possibility that Toyota may one day become a maker of robots to help the elderly.Asked of the potential for Toyota to produce robots for use in the home, he said: “That’s part of what we’re exploring at TRI.”Pratt declined to comment on a media report earlier this month that Toyota is in talks with Google’s parent company Alphabet to acquire Boston Dynamics and Schafts, both of which are robotics divisions of the technology company.	3.308128544
BEIJING (Reuters) - Daimler’s Chinese truck venture partner Beiqi Foton Motor aims to sell 200,000 new energy commercial vehicles a year by 2025, its chairman said on Saturday.Beijing-based Foton, a BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL] unit, will develop electric, hydrogen fuel cell and gasoline-electric trucks and vans, Zhang Xiyong told a conference on Saturday.Foton, which also builds Auman-branded trucks with Daimler, plans to invest 18 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) on research, supply chain and manufacturing facilities for the new energy commercial vehicle project, it said in a statement to Reuters.In April, Toyota Motor Corp said it would supply fuel cell vehicle parts to Foton in a push to promote the fuel cell vehicle industry in China.A growing number of automakers operating in China, the world’s biggest vehicle market, are investing in electric vans and trucks. They are convinced by increasingly stringent restrictions aimed at reining in pollution, and robust demand for light-duty trucks as e-commerce flourishes, Reuters reported last year.	-0.7451253482
NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Toyota Tsusho Corp, one of the world’s biggest lithium producers, said on Friday it would take at least two more years to properly gauge the global electric vehicle (EV) market’s direction before deciding whether to further expand supply.Over the next 2-3 years, major automakers would be introducing more electric cars, making EVs less of a fringe product, Masaharu Katayama, head of the company’s strategic metals unit, told Reuters in an interview.That’s also when it would become clear if people use these vehicles in any fundamentally different way than traditional automobiles, he said, speaking at the company’s headquarters in Nagoya, Japan.“When we have clarity on that, we can have much more clarity on demand for lithium.�� Lithium is one of the core ingredients to make EV batteries.The EV market has boomed in recent years, but still makes up just a fraction of total car sales. Demand has been supported by subsidies and ever-tightening environmental regulations, particularly in China and Europe.So far, Tesla Inc and a handful of Chinese manufacturers have dominated the market, with Nissan Motor Co’s Leaf being the most prominent offering from a major automaker.However, industry giants are ramping up those efforts. Volkswagen AG has promised almost 70 new electric models over the next decade, while General Motors, which has stated its commitment to an “all-electric future,�� plans to make its luxury Cadillac brand electric only.Toyota Tsusho, which is part of the Toyota Group headed by Toyota Motor Corp, currently produces about 15,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate at its plant in Argentina through a joint venture with Australian miner Orocobre. It’s currently in the process of expanding production to 42,500 tonnes from 2021.Katayama says the “primary choice�� if Toyota Tsusho decides to increase production would be to expand the project again, rather than hunting for new supply.“Our cost is very low, so we’re very competitive. ..If we need more production, the resources are there. We just need to build another plant.”Katayama expects demand for lithium for decades, because it’s the most basic ingredient of EV batteries. But he sees the rarer and more expensive metal cobalt as more like a spice, and vulnerable to industry-wide efforts to reduce the amount required for battery production.Despite that, Katayama said Toyota Tsusho is currently scouting for investment opportunities in cobalt mines, although it’s at an early stage. He declined to elaborate on the region or size of investments they are eyeing.He did say that securing cobalt supply is essential if producers are to prevent China from dominating the market the way it’s done in rare earths, an obscure class of metals essential for technologies smartphones to satellites, and EVs.China used that dominance in 2010 amid a diplomatic row with Tokyo over a chain of disputed islets, provoking a crisis that became known in Japan as the “rare earth shock��.“Investment is not enough, if you think about how China has maybe half the cobalt resources,�� Katayama said.“Political influence is a worry. We have the trauma from rare earths.��	5.088548762
(Reuters) - Porsche won the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race for the second year in a row on Sunday after Toyota had a first victory snatched from their grasp by a last lap power failure.Japanese driver Kazuki Nakajima had been on course to take the chequered flag when sudden drama unfolded as he reported a problem with five minutes remaining. He then slowed before coming to a halt.That allowed Porsche to blast past and claim their 18th victory, with the German manufacturer’s number two 919 hybrid car shared by Switzerland’s Neel Jani, Frenchman Roland Dumas and Germany’s Marc Lieb.“What can I say? First of all I feel sorry for the boys down in the other garage,�� said Lieb. “They deserved this, they were giving us a hard time as well. This race should have had two winners, it was really unbelievable.”The 84th edition of the race was watched by a crowd of 263,500 spectators.Toyota would have been only the second Japanese manufacturer to win the greatest prize in sportscar racing, after Mazda in 1991, but instead finished as runners-up for the fifth time.Nakajima had shared the stricken number five Toyota TS050 hybrid car with Britain’s Anthony Davidson and Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi.“I literally have no words,�� said Davidson on Twitter, reporting that Nakajima had said he was ready to cry as he crossed the line.The Toyota pit crew beat him to that as well, the heartbreak evident across the garage.Instead it was the number six Toyota that took second place for Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi, France’s Stephane Sarrazin and Britain’s Mike Conway.Audi finished third with their number eight car.Porsche and stablemates Audi had each entered only two cars instead of three in the main LMP1 category for cost-cutting reasons in the wake of parent company Volkswagen’s diesel emissions scandal.The number one Porsche hit problems shortly before midnight and ceased to be a contender.Last year’s race was won by Germany’s Nico Hulkenberg, New Zealander Earl Bamber and Britain’s Nick Tandy but none of them were driving in the main LMP1 category this time.Hulkenberg was competing in Sunday’s European Formula One Grand Prix in Baku for Force India.Porsche, who returned to Le Mans with a works team in 2014 for the first time in 16 years, are the most successful manufacturer.The race also marked a winning return by Ford in the GTE Pro category.	3.308128544

PARIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan alliance pledged on Friday to double savings from closer integration to 10 billion euros ($11.9 billion) by 2022, thanks in part to increasing cooperation with recently acquired Mitsubishi Motors.Combined annual sales volumes are expected to rise to 14 million vehicles over the same five-year period from about 10 million today, with revenue advancing by one-third to $240 billion, the alliance said in a statement.With 5.27 million cars and vans delivered in the first half, ahead of Volkswagen and Toyota, Renault-Nissan now claims the mantle of the world’s biggest carmaker - although parent Renault has never consolidated the sales of its 43.4 percent-owned Japanese affiliate into its own.Alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn has pledged to step up the pace of integration since Nissan took a controlling stake in Mitsubishi last year. The 18-year-old Renault-Nissan pairing has only recently begun rolling out cars on common architectures.Under existing plans, the alliance is seeking to increase synergies - from costs cut or avoided and revenue enhancements - to 5.5 billion euros next year from 5 billion recorded in 2016.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico could issue arrest warrants for suspected tax dodgers by September, a top prosecutor said, as the government ramps up an aggressive campaign to squeeze more revenue out of businesses and end years of what it calls weak tax collection.A crackdown aimed at boosting state coffers in the country with the lowest tax take in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has already pushed retailer Walmart Inc’s Mexico unit and Coca-Cola bottler Femsa to fork over hundreds of millions of dollars.Various criminal complaints over tax violations are pending, Fiscal Prosecutor Carlos Romero said in an interview, without providing details on the number or the targets. “We were going to have the first arrest orders between April and May, but a pandemic hit us. Right now, I expect it will be between September and October,�� Romero said. “Between 2020 and 2021, there will be people in jail.”The tough tactics are possible due to a reform implemented this year that classifies tax fraud over 7.8 million pesos ($343,419) as a serious crime. Under it, suspects can be arrested when charged and held in custody during proceedings. Romero said the timing of arrests would depend on courts and other authorities being able to re-open after Mexico’s pandemic lockdown.The attorney general’s office is responsible for filing charges with a judge and carrying out arrests based on complaints filed by the tax prosecutor. If large corporate taxpayers were to come under scrutiny, arrest warrants could target several types of positions, including the person in charge of tax payments, board members, lawyers and accountants, Romero added. Mexico’s tax chief, Raquel Buenrostro, said last month that officials had opened “four or five�� cases of corporate tax fraud this year alone, without disclosing names.Romero said this year his office closed two “important�� criminal cases against companies, without specifying how they were resolved. In a third instance, a company reached a deal with the government when presented with the risk of criminal charges, he said.He did not identify the cases closed or the company that reached an agreement. Walmart de Mexico’s corporate affairs director has said she did not have knowledge of a criminal complaint, after the company said it paid 8.08 billion pesos ($359.94 million) in an agreement with the tax authority over the sale of a restaurant chain.Femsa, which pledged to pay 8.8 billion pesos in taxes, was not presented with a criminal charge, a spokeswoman said. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in June said Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp was in the process of putting its tax situation in order.Toyota in Mexico declined to comment on its tax affairs. “If the president has not made an announcement, it’s because there’s still no news,�� Romero said.	7.146810025
Marks claims first Xfinity victoryBy Chris Knight, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeLEXINGTON, Ohio -- Not even a caution with four laps remaining in Saturday’s Mid-Ohio Challenge could detour road course expert Justin Marks from scoring his first career NASCAR Xfinity Series victory at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.Marks, driver of the No. 42 Katerra Chevrolet Camaro, withstood a rain-soaked challenge from Sam Hornish Jr. on the final restart, but Marks showcased his road racing skills when it counted most and stretched his lead to 3.7 seconds when the checkered flag flew.“These are as tough conditions as you can put drivers in,�� Marks said from a makeshift Victory Lane. “It’s just really hard on everybody when it’s dry and wet, and you don’t really know what to do, so strategy plays a big role in it. You know, my specialty is road racing in the rain in these stock cars and I don’t get much of an opportunity to do it so when that opportunity presents itself, you have to really take advantage of it and I about threw it away today.“I knew if the race ended in the rain that we would have a real shot at winning it. I wish my family was here. I’m just really happy.”Marks dedicated the win to former Chip Ganassi Racing driver Bryan Clauson who passed away last Sunday night from injuries in a sprint car accident during the Belleville Midget Nationals in Kansas.“Bryan’s short career in stock car racing came with Chip Ganassi Racing, so it’s great to be able to put this thing in Victory Lane to honor him and think about him,�� Marks said. “He’s a real American hero race car driver. Bryan was. They don’t make them like that anymore.”Hornish, in a limited schedule driving the No. 2 Rheem Chevrolet Camaro for Richard Childress Racing, settled for second.“All in all, a good day for the Rheem Chevrolet,�� Hornish said. “My hat’s off to Justin Marks. I generally held myself as a pretty decent rain racer and even given the opportunity there at the end, I couldn’t do anything with him. I would have had to take massive chances with our car to be able to do anything and you still gotta pass him to keep up with him.“I’m proud of what the guys gave me on the No. 2 car today. I wish we would have gotten a little more out of it. In the dry, I feel like we could win, but Justin just went out there and was just a monster in the wet.”Hornish won the pole on Friday in dry conditions, but as the field took the green at the 2.25-mile, 13 turn road course, Mother Nature moved in and sent the team to pit road for an optional change of tires from slicks to wets on Lap 3.Owen Kelly of Joe Gibbs Racing, in his XFINITY Series return, took the lead on the restart, but spun shortly thereafter in Turn 6 sending Hornish back to the top spot. Hornish, however, would get his first glimpse of Marks on Lap 12 when the Chip Ganassi Racing driver took the lead for the first time.The Rocklin, Calif., native would maintain the lead through the halfway point where he pitted from the lead, cycling the top spot through a variety of drivers during green flag pit stops, as the race track began to transition back to dry.A Lap 50 caution for debris, however, would be the starting point where the race would set the tone for the closing laps. While under the yellow, the skies opened up soaking the road course and sending almost all the competitors back to pit road for wet tires and fuel for the end.When the race restarted with 14 laps to go, Darrell Wallace Jr. found himself at the top, but with 12 laps to go, he went off course, giving the lead to Ty Dillon with a stalking Marks behind.With rain continuing to fall, Marks used his experience to close the distance between Dillon and took advantage as Dillon himself went off course on Lap 65 giving the lead back to Marks on Lap 66 and never relinquishing.Next up for the XFINITY Series is their annual summer trip to Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway for the running of the Food City 300 on Friday night, Aug. 19. Kyle Busch is the defending champion.NASCAR Next driver Alon Day made his NASCAR XFINITY Series debut on Saturday, finishing 13th. With the start, Day - who ran as high as third -- became the first driver from Israel to make a NASCAR national series start.NASCAR XFINITY Series Race -- Mid-Ohio ChallengeMid-Ohio Sports Car CourseLexington, OhioSaturday, Aug. 13, 20161.

(Makes clear in paragraph 3 that settlement resolves entire case)Oct 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp reached a deal on Friday to resolve a lawsuit in the United States over unintended acceleration issues, one day after a jury found the Japanese carmaker liable and ordered it to pay $3 million for defects that caused a 2007 fatal crash.A jury in Oklahoma on Thursday ordered the company to pay $3 million in compensatory damages to Jean Bookout, a driver injured in the 2007 crash, and the family of Barbara Schwarz, who was killed. Jurors were scheduled to resume deliberating on Friday on whether to award punitive damages against Toyota.Before the jury could reach a decision, Toyota and lawyers for the plaintiffs announced they had reached a confidential settlement to resolve the case.The lawsuit is one of the first involving acceleration issues to go to trial since similar concerns prompted Toyota to begin in 2009 to recall millions of vehicles. The lawsuit alleged that software defects in the electronic throttle control system of Bookout’s 2005 Camry caused it to speed out of control and crash, killing Schwarz.“While we strongly disagree with the verdict, we are satisfied that the parties reached a mutually acceptable agreement to settle this case,�� Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said in a statement.A lawyer for the plaintiffs, J. Cole Portis, said they were pleased with the jury’s decision. “We are fully convinced that Toyota’s conduct from the time the electronic throttle control system was designed has been shameful,�� Portis said in a statement. “We appreciate that the jury had the courage to let Toyota and the public know that Toyota was reckless.”The case is the first loss for Toyota in a string of early trials over acceleration issues, which prompted hundreds of lawsuits across the country in the wake of the recalls. The 2005 Camry at issue in the Oklahoma trial was not included in the recalls.Two earlier trials in Brooklyn, New York, and California, absolved Toyota of liability for alleged acceleration-related defects.There have been roughly 200 proposed class actions and more than 500 individual cases filed against Toyota since February 2009 over the alleged acceleration issues, according to a regulatory filing from the company.Toyota has already agreed to pay a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims for economic losses, such as repair costs or lowered resale value, over acceleration issues. That settlement did not cover personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits. (Reporting by Jessica Dye in New York; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)	-2.157825037

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen Group VOWG_p.DE, the world's biggest carmaker, is suspending production at factories across Europe as the coronavirus pandemic hits sales and disrupts supply chains, the company said on Tuesday.The German carmaker, which owns the Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Ducati, Lamborghini, Porsche, Seat and Skoda brands, also said that uncertainty about the fallout from coronavirus meant it was impossible to give forecasts for its performance this year.“Given the present significant deterioration in the sales situation and the heightened uncertainty regarding parts supplies to our plants, production is to be suspended in the near future at factories operated by group brands,�� Chief Executive Herbert Diess said on Tuesday.Volkswagen’s powerful works council concluded it was not possible for workers to maintain a safe distance from each other to prevent contagion and recommended a suspension of production at its factories from Friday.Production will be halted at VW’s Spanish plants, in Setubal in Portugal, Bratislava in Slovakia and at the Lamborghini and Ducati plants in Italy before the end of this week, Diess said.Most of its other German and European factories will prepare to suspend production, probably for two to three weeks, while Audi said separately it would halt output at its plants in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and Mexico.Volkswagen’s vast factory in Puebla, Mexico, and plants in Brazil and the United States were not affected but that would depend on how the coronavirus spreads, VW said.Volkswagen has 124 production sites worldwide of which 72 are in Europe, with 28 in Germany alone.��2020 will be a very difficult year. The coronavirus pandemic presents us with unknown operational and financial challenges. At the same time, there are concerns about sustained economic impacts,�� Diess said.Volkswagen Group sold 10.96 million vehicles last year, putting it ahead of Toyota based on the latest figures from the Japanese carmaker. Globally, VW employs 671,000 people and it delivered 4.86 million vehicles to European customers in 2019.Only last month the car and truck maker based in Wolfsburg in Germany predicted that vehicle deliveries this year would match 2019 sales and forecast an operating return on sales in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%.“The spread of coronavirus is currently impacting the global economy. It is uncertain how severely or for how long this will also affect the Volkswagen Group. Currently, it is almost impossible to make a reliable forecast,�� Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said.Sales in January and February were down about 15% and earnings before interest and taxes in the first three months of the year were expected to at least halve compared with the same period a year earlier, Witter said.While VW was preparing to suspend production in Europe, manufacturing has resumed in China, with the exception of plants in Changsha and Urumqi, and the company still plans to boost its operations in the country where the coronavirus first emerged.""We are looking at ways in which we can strengthen our position in China,"" CEO Diess said. VW has joint ventures with Chinese automakers FAW 000800.SZ and SAIC 600104.SS.Volkswagen Group also said its operating profit rose 22% to 16.9 billion euros ($18.5 bln) in 2019 thanks to strong sales of higher-margin cars and lower diesel charges, defying an industry downturn that has hurt rivals.Earnings were driven by higher profits at its VW, Porsche, Seat and Skoda brands, and a return to profitability for its luxury sportscar brand Bentley.Improvements in the mix and price positioning in particular compensated for lower sales of Volkswagen passenger cars, launch costs and the impact of exchange rates, VW said.Philippe Houchois, automotive analyst at Jeffries, said the results were impressive. “Very solid quality numbers with strong free cashflow coming in part from working capital.��($1 = 0.8952 euros)"	2.472874085
Jan 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has alerted U.S. safety officials about seat material in several vehicles that does not meet fire retardation standards, which could result in a recall depending on what the safety agency decides.The Japanese automaker said on Thursday it had stopped selling several models in North America equipped with seat heaters made since August 2012 after being alerted by South Korean safety officials that material in the part did not meet fire retardation standards also used in the United States. The cars are built in United States and some are exported to Korea.Toyota spokesman John Hanson said the company had informed the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the issue and would file an official report later on Thursday outlining the non-compliance with the standard. He added that Toyota did not feel a recall was necessary.“We don’t believe that it is a defect issue or a safety-related issue because there has been no occurrence of any problems out in the real world,�� Hanson said.There have been no reports of accidents, fires or injuries related to the issue in the affected vehicles in the United States, Canada or Mexico, he said.The NHTSA will make the final determination on whether a recall is needed, and Hanson said he did not know the timeline for that decision. Toyota does not know yet how many cars are affected by the issue, he said.NHTSA officials could not immediately be reached to comment.Toyota dealers have been told to stop selling any of the affected vehicles until the part can be replaced, Hanson said. The automaker will handle requests by individual owners to replace the part at no cost on a case-by-case basis.Affected vehicles are the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Avalon sedan, Avalon hybrid, Corolla subcompact, Sienna minivan and Tundra and Tacoma pickup trucks equipped with seat heaters that were sold since August 2012, when the fabric supplier was changed, he said.Toyota found out about the issue when it was notified that the seat heater did not pass a test conducted by the Korean Automotive Test and Research Institute (KATRI), which uses the same standard as NHTSA, Hanson said.The Korean agency found that the material in the seat heater does not meet standards that require it to retard a flame across the material surface at a specified rate, he said. KATRI notified Toyota of the failed compliance.	-1.010805159

Crafton has enough fuel in tank for Trucks winBy Jim PedleyNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeKANSAS CITY, Kan. - Matt Crafton didn’t have the fastest truck in Friday night’s Toyota Tundra 250 at Kansas Speedway, but he had the best feel for fuel mileage and what his crew chief would call their lucky fuel cell. The result was Crafton’s seventh series career victory.With truck after truck pulling to the inside of the 1.5-mile Kansas oval over the last five laps with empty fuel cells, Crafton cruised over the finish line with only a few drops of fuel left in his ThorSport Racing Toyota Tundra.“It was not the winning truck,�� Crafton said after getting to Victory Lane. “We were definitely a second-place truck.”The truck that obviously was the fastest was the No. 4 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota Tundra of rookie Erik Jones. It led 151 of 167 laps and was comfortably in the lead with four laps to go.But it was also one of those trucks which ran short of fuel at the end. It wound up 11th.“It just sucks -- we had by far the best truck,�� Jones said after the race. “We were up to an 11-second lead at one point and it’s just so terrible for these guys when we bring that fast of a truck. We couldn’t bring the win home and I saved as much as I could most of the run.“The 19 (Tyler Reddick) made us run pretty hard. Being eight laps short, I don’t know how the 88 (Crafton) made it. It’s too bad, we’ll have to bring another fast truck next weekend to Charlotte and we’ll go get a win there.”Also running out of fuel while in contention for the victory in the final laps after Jones dropped out were Reddick and Daniel Suarez.The victory was the second of the season for Crafton, the defending series champion, and his second in the last three NASCAR Camping World Truck Series races at Kansas. That made him the first driver to win more than once at the track located on the far west side of Kansas City.“I heard somebody say that to me before the race,�� Crafton, who led a total of six laps, said of the Kansas landmark win. “I said, ‘Two times.’�The victory allowed Crafton to pad his points lead to 17 over Reddick as he attempts to win a third-straight series championship.“You’ve got to be close enough to sneak one out once in a while,�� Crafton said. “I’ve lost some like this so every once in a while when you steal one I don’t feel too bad about it.”After the race, Crafton’s crew chief, Carl Joyner gave credit to a particular fuel cell, which he said has given his trucks better fuel mileage for some reason.Sprint Cup regular Ryan Newman, driving a truck owned by former Kansas Sprint Cup race winner Joe Nemechek and making his first truck series start since 2013, finished second.Newman was in the seat as a favor to Nemechek, who is in the process of grooming his son John Hunter for the ride.“Trying to teach John Hunter a little bit of what I’ve experienced on pit road, how to get everything you possibly can,�� Newman said. “But that wasn’t my main goal. My goal was to come here and win.”Johnny Sauter finished third.Rounding out the top five were veteran Timothy Peters and rookie Cameron Hayley.Jones, who won the pole earlier in the day with a lap at 179.396 mph, led the first 43 laps.For the first 30 laps, Crafton stayed close to the young driver from Michigan. But then Jones began to pull away. On Lap 38, Jones�� lead over Crafton was 4 seconds.On Lap 41, a caution flag waved and on the ensuing stops, Crafton beat Jones out of the pits to take the lead.On Lap 48, back came Jones to take the lead and once out in clean air again, he began to pull away. On Lap 60, his lead was 2.9 seconds. He would lose that margin - and the lead - as he was beat out of the pits after yellow flag stops that began on Lap 67 by Newman.But on the restart, he left Newman behind. By Lap 88, Jones�� lead was 6 seconds. By Lap 105, it was over 10 seconds on Newman.On Lap 109, the caution waved again and, once again, Jones�� lead was erased as he was beaten off pit road by Reddick, who was involved in a crash with his Brad Keselowski Racing teammate and started the race from the back in his backup truck.But once again the restart, Jones moved back to the front and began to move to a seemingly comfortable lead.But only seemingly.“I didn’t know how short we were, but I knew the fuel window,�� Jones, who will make his first Sprint Cup Series start Saturday night in Kansas, said. “I knew we had to save and I couldn’t give the lead up to the 19 (Tyler Reddick) at that point.”NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- Toyota Tundra 250Kansas SpeedwayKansas City, KansasFriday, May 81.

June 2 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the New York Times business pages. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.- At least four automakers - Toyota, Volkswagen , Fiat Chrysler and Mitsubishi - continue to sell new vehicles with defective Takata airbags that will need to be recalled, according to a Senate Commerce Committee report released on Wednesday. (nyti.ms/1r3mTnA)- Uber said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, in one of the largest-ever investments into a privately held start-up. (nyti.ms/1P7UgM5)- The European Central Bank is not expected to make any changes to monetary policy when it meets Thursday. In fact, with the region trapped in a period of economic stasis, it may not do much of anything for many months to come. (nyti.ms/1TQTCKg)- Steve Mosko, the chairman of Sony Pictures Television, has left the studio. The departure of Mosko, 60, came a day after NBC Entertainment pushed out Bela Bajaria as president of Universal Television, which suffered a sharp decline in orders for the fall season.

GUANGZHOU/BEIJING (Reuters) - German auto giants Volkswagen AG, BMW and Daimler see China’s future as being electric - encouraged by generous government subsidies - but that bet puts them at odds with some of their Asian rivals.While the Europeans were heralding the all-electric vehicle at the Guangzhou auto show this week, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor were unveiling hydrogen fuel cell cars at shows in Tokyo and Los Angeles.The two Japanese heavyweights plan to start selling their hydrogen vehicles in 2015, brushing off electric technology as being good enough only to power tiny city cars.One of the most ambitious in betting on electric cars in China, the world’s largest auto market, is Volkswagen.On the eve of the Guangzhou show, Volkswagen said its brands, including Volkswagen and Audi, plan to launch a total of more than 15 near-all-electric plug-in cars by 2018, many of which will be locally produced.“We forecast high volumes in this area,�� Jochem Heizmann, head of Volkswagen Group China, told reporters this week.BMW and its local partner Brilliance Auto unveiled a jointly developed all-electric battery car in Guangzhou. The two companies plan to start leasing the car next year under a new jointly run China-only brand called Zinoro.Daimler said it was also on track to launch an all-electric car next year under a new China-only brand called Denza, which the German company operates jointly with Chinese battery and car producer BYD Co.The rush into all-electric cars comes as Beijing ramps up a program to put 5 million new energy vehicles - defined as all-electric battery vehicles and heavily electrified “near all-electric�� plug-in hybrids - on the road by 2020.China this year expanded the definition of new energy cars to include fuel cell cars.The two concepts have polarized the industry.Fuel cell cars can run up to five times longer than their all-electric counterparts, but come with a heftier price tag.But unlike electric vehicles which can be recharged from home as well as charging stations, fuel cell cars must stop at refilling stations. The hydrogen stations are costly to build, at about $6 million apiece.Some industry insiders and experts believe China is too focused on all-electric cars or plug-ins.“Toyota believes the industry isn’t likely to come up with breakthroughs to make all-electric cars a viable solution any time soon,�� said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight. “Unlike China, some countries have taken a more flexible approach, rather than setting the path on one solution too early.”Toyota, in particular, thinks all-electric car technology is good enough to power only tiny city cars - not powerful enough for larger cars.At this week’s Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota unveiled a fuel cell concept sedan with two hydrogen tanks and a driving range of 500 km (310 miles). The car, it said, would sell for 5 million to 10 million yen ($50,000-100,000) when it goes on sale in 2015.Honda also unveiled a five-passenger hydrogen fuel cell vehicle at the Los Angeles Auto Show this week. By his own admission, the company’s chief executive of its U.S. business, Tetsuo Iwamura, expects uptake to be slow due to poor infrastructure.In China’s congested and bustling cities, electric charging or hydrogen fuelling stations are a rare sight. Volkswagen says the infrastructure is not good enough, and believes plug-in hybrid technology is the solution.Plug-in cars come equipped with a small gasoline engine that can power the car when it is drained of electricity.Nissan Motor plans to sell a fuel cell car in Japan and North America starting in 2017, but like Volkswagen, sees electric technology as the future in China, according to Ren Yong, a senior executive of Dongfeng Nissan Passenger Vehicle Co, Nissan’s Chinese venture with a local partner.Nissan plans to start selling a locally developed electric car in China under the Venucia brand as early as next year.	-5.573588789
NAGOYA, Japan, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Monday that markets are already pricing in expectations that the central bank will continue its powerful monetary easing until 1 pct inflation is foreseen.Shirakawa made the remark when asked about the minutes of the BOJ’s Oct. 30 meeting, released earlier on Monday, which showed that two newcomers on its board proposed strengthening its commitment to an easy monetary policy by changing the language on rising prices in its policy pledge.“Japan’s consumer inflation may gradually exceed 1 percent if government and private-sector efforts to boost Japan’s growth potential bear fruit,�� Shirakawa told a news conference after meeting business leaders in Nagoya in the central Japan prefecture of Aichi, home to automobile giant Toyota Motor Corp .The BOJ kept monetary policy steady last week after having eased for the second straight month in October, preferring to save its limited options for now as political pressure for bolder monetary expansion heightens after a general election in December.	4.185402975
(Adds detail from Nissan and Toyota)SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Honda Motor Co Ltd plans to slow production at some of its plants in North America due to a parts shortage caused by a partial shutdown of ports along the West Coast.The company expects shortages at its operations in Ohio, Indiana and Ontario, Canada, starting Monday and for each plant to adjust its production between Feb. 16 and Feb. 23, spokesman Mark Morrison told Reuters by email.Ports along the U.S. West Coast are near gridlock due to a lengthy labor dispute between dockworkers and the group representing shippers and terminal operators.With cargo delays rippling through the U.S. economy, President Barack Obama on Saturday dispatched U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez to California to help broker an agreement between shipping companies and dock workers.“We do not have a sufficient supply of several critical parts to keep the production lines running smoothly and efficiently. These parts include a small number of critical parts such as electronics, and some larger assemblies such as transmissions,�� Morrison said.Honda plants expected to slow production of models including the Civic, CR-V, Accord and Acura, Morrison said.It and other car makers have already been transporting some crucial parts from Asia to U.S. factories by airplane due to the disruption caused by the labor dispute.Toyota Motor Corp, which built about 2 million vehicles in North America last year, has reduced overtime at some factories in North America, said spokesman Mike Goss.Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it has been somewhat affected by the West Coast slowdown.“However, since about 85 percent of Nissan’s U.S. sales volume is from vehicles manufactured at plants in North America, and the localization rate of parts in the region is high, we believe there will be minimal impact on Nissan’s operations,�� Nissan spokesman David Reuter said in an email.

BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. and its local partners boosted sales in China by nearly 50 percent last year, nudging past Japanese giants Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. to make big inroads into the world’s largest auto market.For much of the past decade, Ford has trailed Japan’s big car makers, but a line-up of new and revamped vehicles, including the top-selling Focus, and a China-Japan territorial spat helped the U.S. company in 2013.The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said on Monday that along with its local partners, it had sold 935,813 vehicles in China last year, a 49-percent increase from 2012.Ford still lags a long way behind General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG which are both expected to announce sales of more than 3 million vehicles in China last year.Toyota and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 917,500 vehicles in China last year, up 9.2 percent from 2012. Honda’s 2013 China volume totalled 756,882 vehicles, up 26.4 percent from 2012.Industry insiders and experts attributed Ford’s surge to its beefed-up product lineup. New in the showroom since late 2012 are a couple of small sport-utility vehicles and the redesigned Focus. It also added the redesigned Mondeo car, a China version of the car marketed in North America as the Fusion, to its lineup.What also helped Ford was a sales crisis that hit Japanese brands in the fall of 2012 and lingered through 2013.Violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in 2012 after Japan nationalised two East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese, by buying them from their private owners. Japanese car makers�� sales in China fell sharply as a result.Toyota and other Japanese companies clawed back sales through 2013 as tensions eased, but Tokyo-Beijing relations could tip again at any time.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month visited the Yasukuni Shrine, seen by critics as a symbol of Japan’s wartime aggression, which infuriated China and South Korea and prompted concern from the United States about deteriorating ties between the North Asian neighbours.Toyota China sales and marketing executives said key new products, including the redesigned RAV4 Toyota-branded compact sport-utility vehicle which was launched during the fourth quarter, helped it recover much of the ground the company lost after a dispute over a group of islets in the East China Sea fanned anti-Japan sentiment in China.Now, Toyota said it aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China this year.That is a milestone Toyota has been trying to clear since the late 2000s.A decade ago, Toyota’s chief executive Akio Toyoda, who back then ran the company’s China operations, and his lieutenants set the “aspirational�� goal of selling one million cars annually by 2010.Also likely to pressure the performance of Toyota and other Japanese brands in China is the surge in sales volume by Ford.Though Ford surpassed Toyota and Honda in China sales volume, it still has miles to go to break into the China’s top-three. The likes of GM and Volkswagen AG are well ahead, and it still has considerable ground to make to catch Nissan Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co.According to consulting firm LMC Automotive, the Volkswagen Group is forecast to sell about 3.2 million vehicles in 2013 in China, up from 2.8 million vehicles it sold in 2012. GM is also expected to have sold more than 3 million vehicles last year.Nissan, meanwhile, was aiming to sell 1.25 million vehicles last year. Consulting firm LMC Automotive said Hyundai Group’s sales in China last year should have reached 1.64 million vehicles, up from 1.4 million last year.	-3.75301656

(Reuters) - Sebastien Ogier breathed new life into his hopes of a seventh successive world championship by leading a Citroen one-two in Rally Turkey on Sunday.The Frenchman, now 17 points behind Toyota’s Estonian Ott Tanak after 11 of 14 rounds, beat Finnish team mate Esapekka Lappi by 34.7 seconds on the rocky mountain roads around Marmaris.Hyundai’s Andreas Mikkelsen was third, the Norwegian’s points stretching the South Korean manufacturer’s lead over Toyota in the team standings to 19 points.Tanak, who took five points from the closing power stage after retiring on Saturday, now has 210 points to Ogier’s 193 with a maximum 90 still to be won.Hyundai’s Belgian Thierry Neuville finished eighth, but with four bonus power stage points, and dropped from second to third in the standings with 180. He had rolled his car into a ditch on Saturday.The victory was Ogier’s first since Mexico in March and his third of the campaign.“This win was really needed and our only chance to get back in the championship fight,�� Ogier, who took the lead on Saturday after Tanak had retired with an electrical problem, told the wrc.com website.“We knew anything could happen because it’s a super-rough rally but the bad luck we had on the previous round in Germany was behind us.”The next round is in Wales from Oct. 3-6.	0.6032072973

(Adds detail from Honda in paragraph 2)TOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - Japan’s three biggest carmakers are expanding a huge global recall triggered by potentially fatal air bags made by Takata Corp, saying on Wednesday they will take back millions of vehicles worldwide for investigation.Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co said they are recalling some 6.5 million vehicles globally, while Honda Motor Co Ltd said it would follow suit, without giving details. A U.S. Honda spokesman added, however, that any potential action would not affect cars that were sold in the United States.Wednesday’s announcements raise to roughly 31 million the number of vehicles recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata air bag inflators, which can erupt with too much force, spraying shrapnel inside the car.The Takata-linked recalls top the largest U.S. recall of 21 million vehicles by Ford Motor Co in the 1980s for a parking gear problem, according to U.S. safety regulators and safety advocates. General Motors recalled about 30 million vehicles last year, but those were for a range of defects, including faulty ignition switches.U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said Toyota and Nissan as well as Japanese government officials have been in contact with the U.S. safety agency over the last few days, and NHTSA will soon announce “significant new steps�� related to accelerating Takata recalls.“While precise root cause remains undetermined, the clear association with high humidity has suggested that moisture and time are factors in this defect,�� Trowbridge said.Asked about the latest recalls, a Takata spokeswoman said a probe into the causes for the air bag defects was ongoing and that the company continued to cooperate with the automakers.Six deaths have been linked to the defective Takata airbags, all on cars made by Honda, which announced disappointing profit forecasts last month citing high quality-related costs.Toyota and Nissan said their recalls were precautionary and that no accidents or injuries had been reported.They did not give further details about the suspected defects, but in documents submitted to Japan’s transport ministry, the automakers said they had identified problems with inflators that were not sufficiently sealed and that were at risk of allowing in moisture during extended use.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, said it would recall just under 5 million Corolla, Vitz and other models, mostly in Japan and Europe.Many of the models were built between March 2003 and November 2007, and include 1.36 million to be recalled in Japan.Nissan said it was recalling about 1.56 million cars globally over the same problem. The automaker said nine models in Japan were affected, including the X-Trail SUV, Fuga sedan and Isuzu Como van. It did not immediately provide details on models affected in other markets.Takata faces multiple class action lawsuits in the United States and Canada as well as a U.S. criminal investigation and a regulatory probe.The company said last week it expects to return to profit in the business year started in April even though it has made few provisions for costs related to the massive global recall.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday said its domestic vehicle production would be 1% higher than initially planned in September, as its plants resume output levels following a steep drop because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The company plans to produce roughly 2,300 more cars and trucks than its initial plan for around 230,000, Reuters calculations found.Vehicle production at the world’s No.2 automaker is recovering at home and abroad since global output fell by more than half year-on-year in April and May, when plants were shuttered to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Toyota declined to comment on global production plans for next month, but the company has said it expects global sales will be 15% lower in the July-September quarter from last year, and 5% lower in October-December. By early 2021, sales will be 5% higher on the year.Toyota plans to sell 7.2 million vehicles in the year to March, down 20% from a year ago.	-2.626892253

(Reuters) - BMW BMWG.DE grabbed the top spot in the U.S. luxury auto market in 2011, edging out Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz brand, as both German automakers took advantage of inventory problems for Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus lineup, according to company figures issued on Thursday.The BMW brand sold 247,907 vehicles in 2011, up 13 percent from the previous year. Mercedes-Benz brand sold 245,231 vehicles, also up 13 percent.BMW’s surge ended the streak of 11 years for Lexus as the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. market. Lexus was third in 2011, selling 198,552 vehicles, a drop of 13 percent. Toyota and Lexus sales suffered from the effects of last March’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan.Toyota officials projected on Wednesday that Lexus�� 2012 U.S. sales will increase by more than 20 percent.Edmunds.com said this week that BMW increased consumer incentives by more than $200 per vehicle in December from a year earlier in an attempt to snatch the luxury sales title. Mercedes-Benz kept its incentives essentially flat, Edmunds said.BMW and Mercedes-Benz both delayed releasing details of their December auto sales until Thursday. All other mass-market automakers in the U.S. market issued December and full-year results on Wednesday.Including the Mini brand’s five models, BMW’s U.S. sales were 305,418 last year, up 15 percent from 2010.Including Daimler’s Sprinter commercial van and the subcompact Smart car, Mercedes-Benz USA sales were 254,460, up 17.5 percent from 2010.General Motors Co GM.N has positioned Buick as a luxury brand and it was fourth in that category in 2011, with sales of 177,633, up 13 percent. GM's Cadillac was a laggard among luxury brands; it grew by only 3 percent to 152,389 vehicles sold, for fifth place.Most luxury brands outpaced the U.S. auto market’s 10 percent gain in 2011.Honda's 7267.T Acura brand also suffered from effects of the Japanese earthquake, and saw sales drop 8 percent to 123,299 vehicles.In seventh place was Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE Audi with sales of 117,561, up 16 percent. Nissan Motor Co's 7201.T Infiniti, also impacted by the Japan earthquake, sold 98,461 vehicles, down 5 percent.Ford Motor Co's F.N Lincoln sales were essentially flat at 85,643, for ninth place. Ford kept Lincoln as its only other brand in North America as it restructured in the past few years, and has pledged to refurbish the brand that several decades ago was the top luxury brand in America.Rounding out the top ten in the U.S. luxury market last year was former Ford property Volvo, now owned by China's Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175.HK. Volvo's U.S. sales in 2011 were 67,240 vehicles, up 25 percent.	13.42869654
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide because of an electronic defect that can result in air bags not deploying in crashes.The recall, which includes 2.9 million U.S. vehicles, covers 2011-2019 Corolla, 2011-2013 Matrix, 2012-2018 Avalon and 2013-2018 Avalon Hybrid vehicles and is tied to a report of one fatal crash.The vehicles may have an electronic control unit that does not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can occur in crashes, which could lead to incomplete or non-deployment of the air bags. It could also impede the operation of seat-belt pretensioners.In April, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) expanded a probe into 12.3 million potentially defective air bags covering a number of automakers, including the vehicles Toyota is recalling.NHTSA said in April it had identified two frontal crash events, including one fatal crash “involving Toyota products where (electrical overstress) is suspected as the likely cause�� of air bags not deploying. Both involved newer Corolla cars.NHTSA said the air bags under investigation were installed in more than 12 million vehicles from 2010 through 2019 sold by Toyota, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Mitsubishi.They were equipped with an air bag control unit initially produced by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp, which is now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen.In total, NHTSA said as many as eight deaths could be tied to the issue.Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler previously issued recalls for more than 2.5 million vehicles with the TRW air bag control units in question that might not deploy in crashes.When it recalled nearly 2 million vehicles for air bag non-deployments in 2016, Fiat Chrysler said it had reports of three deaths and five injuries that might be related to the defect.Hyundai and Kia ultimately recalled more than 1 million vehicles for air bag non-deployment concerns in 2018. Hyundai and Kia in 2018 said they had reports of four deaths and six injuries in North America tied to the issue.Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the air bag control module and its wire harness if needed.Toyota declined to say how many deaths or injuries have been tied to the defect. Toyota will notify vehicle owners of the recall by mid-March.	-1.780163888
INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday an unnamed foreign leader told him at the United Nations last week that the country would soon announce plans to build or expand five automobile industry factories in the United States.“I just left the United Nations last week and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they are going to be announcing in the not too distant future five major factories in the United States, between increasing and new, five,�� Trump said in a speech on tax reform in Indianapolis. He added the factories were in the automotive industry.Trump did not name the country or its leader. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and 12 other leaders in New York at the U.N. General Assembly meeting last week, but did not meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel who was in Germany ahead of an election.Automakers in Japan and Germany have both announced investments in the United States this year, with companies coming under pressure from Trump’s bid to curb imports and hire more workers to build cars and trucks in the U.S.Investments to expand U.S. vehicle production capacity also reflect intensified competition for market share in the world’s most profitable vehicle market.In August, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it would build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant with Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T.Toyota also said this week it was investing nearly $375 million in five U.S. manufacturing plants to support U.S. production of hybrid powertrains.Last week, German automaker Daimler AG DAIGn.DE said it would spend $1 billion to expand its Mercedes Benz operations near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to produce batteries and electric sport utility vehicles and create more than 600 jobs. Rival German luxury automaker BMW AG BMWG.DE said in June it would expand its U.S. factory in South Carolina, adding 1,000 jobs. And last month, Volkswagen AG’s VOWG_p.DE brand president Herbert Diess said the company expected to bring electric SUV production to the United States and could add production at its Tennessee plant.	4.005016722

TOKYO (Reuters) - As global automakers race to put long-range electric vehicles on highways amid stricter emission laws, Japanese rivals are taking a niche approach and steering towards cheaper, pint-sized runabouts to make costly battery technology more accessible.At the Tokyo Motor Show that starts on Thursday, Toyota Motor, Nissan and others are due to show prototypes of one- and two-seater electric vehicles (EVs) designed for short distances with limited top speeds.They are betting such EVs are best-placed for Japan’s narrow streets, cramped parking spaces and rapidly ageing society, and that the vehicles will eventually catch on globally too as the elderly population grows. But the jury is still out on whether these vehicles will work overseas.The Japanese strategy is in contrast to that of General Motors, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and other global players who are focusing on normal-sized passenger vehicles, including SUVs, to compete with the top-selling Tesla Model 3 EV sedan.Toyota’s new, ultra-compact BEV seats two people and has a top speed of just 60 kilometres (37 miles) per hour and a range of 100 kilometres on a single charge. At a length of 2.49 metres, it is a little over half the size of the Tesla Model 3.Japan’s top automaker, which pioneered “green car�� technologies with the Prius gasoline hybrid more than 20 years ago, has long argued that all-battery EVs are best suited for short trips due to high battery costs.It also believes lower-emission hybrids and zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, like its second-generation Mirai FCV, work better for longer-distance driving.“It’s difficult to apply the same technology to all driving needs,�� said Akihiro Yanaka, a manager at Toyota’s EV product development and planning department, at a preview for the ultra-compact BEV, which goes on sale in Japan in late 2020.“So if we can leverage the strengths of battery electric technology into smaller vehicles, we’d like to initially focus on that application.”Nissan, Japan’s No.2 car maker, too is pushing its new IMk as a futuristic expression of a “kei��, or minicar.Kei cars, which represent about a third of all Japanese passenger car sales, are the low-cost, fuel-sipping vehicles marketed almost exclusively for the domestic market and normally start around $10,000.Toyota did not provide pricing details for the ultra-compact BEV.Honda Motor is also pursuing a “smaller-is-better�� strategy with its higher-priced Honda e, a petite, four-seater battery electric hatchback launched earlier this year.Honda plans to sell it in Europe and Japan at a starting price of around $32,000, putting it in range of Tesla’s Model 3 that has a starting price of around $39,000.Japanese automakers are not the only ones to see smaller EVs as the short-term solution to the high-cost and limited range of battery EVs. Small EVs have been on the global market for the past decade, since Daimler AG’s Smart brand launched a battery electric version of its Fortwo model.But they have yet to go mainstream partly due to a starting price north of $20,000, similar to many family-sized gasoline sedans, and a lack of demand in North America.Nissan and Toyota are for now planning their tiny EV models for the home market and see the possibility of marketing them overseas in the future, as emissions regulations tighten particularly in Europe and China.While it is unclear if these pint-sized cars will be able to find traction in, say, the sprawling suburbs and highways of the United States, some industry players believe these mini EVs will help meet a need for a wider range of mobility products as more people age worldwide.The need for small EVs is already being felt in Japan, which is “facing more issues involving elderly people and mobility, due to the rapidly ageing population��, said Satoshi Nagashima, managing partner at Roland Berger Japan.The consulting firm is exhibiting a low-speed, remote-controlled, compact EV at the Tokyo Motor Show. The car is aimed at shuttling passengers around hotel and venue grounds.“Small vehicles which run over shorter distances at lower speeds are becoming a particular niche here,�� Nagashima said, adding that the sector could become the next battleground for automakers and other mobility companies.	3.794057676
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An executive with the Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp 7312.T was indicted on Thursday for conspiring to fix the prices of seat belts sold to carmakers, the U.S. Justice Department said.The indictment is the latest in a global probe of price fixing of auto parts. A total of 32 companies have pleaded guilty or agreed to do so and 50 executives have taken a plea bargain or been indicted in the investigation.Hiromu Usuda, a sales executive for Takata from 2005 to 2011, is accused of meeting with executives of other companies that make seat belts to reach agreements on what they would charge, the department said.The affected automakers were Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T, which makes Subaru cars, the department said.Efforts to reach Usuda for comment through Takata were unsuccessful.The Justice Department and other antitrust enforcers worldwide have been investigating price fixing of more than 30 car parts, including air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components.	5.645534475
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co Ltd 002594.SZ, 1211.HK reported on Tuesday a 42% drop in 2019 profit, saying cuts in government subsidies and emissions rules changes had hit demand in the sector.BYD, which is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett, said its net profit for 2019 totalled 1.61 billion yuan ($227 million), while its revenue dropped 1.78% to 127.74 billion yuan last year.China cut subsidies for new energy vehicles (NEV), which include battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, last year, making the final product more costly for carmakers.After that NEV sales fell for nine straight months. However, last month China said it would extend subsidies for new energy vehicles and extend NEV’s purchase tax exemption for two years.The Shenzhen-based car company, which has partnerships with Japan's top automaker Toyota 7203.T and German Daimler's DAIGn.DE partner in China, sold 461,399 vehicles in 2019, down 11.4% from the previous year.In 2019, China’s overall auto market dropped 8.2%, while sales for NEVs fell 4%.	-3.187021329
NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - General Motors was hit on Friday with what appeared to be the first lawsuit related to the recall of 1.6 million cars, as customers claimed their vehicles lost value because of ignition problems blamed for a series of fatal crashes.The proposed class action, filed in federal court in Texas, said GM knew about the problem since 2004, but failed to fix it, creating “unreasonably dangerous�� conditions for drivers of the affected models.“GM’s mishandling of the ignition switch defect....has adversely affected the company’s reputation as a manufacturer of safe, reliable vehicles with high resale value,�� the lawsuit said.The recall has led to government criminal and civil investigations, an internal probe by GM, and preparations for hearings by Congress. All ask why GM took so long to address a problem it has said first came to its attention in 2001.A GM spokesman, Greg Martin, said the company has apologized for how it handled the recall and that taking care of customers was its first priority. He did not comment on the lawsuit.The plaintiffs are seeking damages from GM that include compensation for loss of the use of their vehicles and repairs and diminished resale value. They are not claiming they were injured in accidents stemming from ignition problems.The lawsuit is reminiscent of claims faced by Toyota Motor Corp, which recalled more than 10 million vehicles starting in 2009. Toyota last year received approval for a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve economic loss claims and is currently negotiating the settlement of hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits.GM announced the recall in February, despite learning of problems with the ignition switch in 2001 and issuing related service bulletins to dealers with suggested remedies in 2005.GM said that when the ignition switch was jostled, a key could turn off the car’s engine and disable airbags, sometimes while traveling at high speed. GM has said it received reports of 12 deaths and 34 crashes in the recalled cars.The Center for Auto Safety, a watchdog group, on Thursday said that data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed 303 deaths occurred when airbags failed to deploy in two of the models GM recalled. GM called the report “pure speculation�� and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Center for Trauma and EMS at the University of Maryland said the figure did not take into account whether airbags would be expected to deploy in some crashes.The plaintiffs in Friday’s lawsuit, Daryl and Maria Brandt, said they own a 2007 Chevy Cobalt, which was one of several models recalled by GM. They said that they have driven their car less than they otherwise would because they feared being in an accident stemming from the ignition issues, according to the complaint.Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law who specializes in products liability, said he did not expect GM would have to pay as much as Toyota did if it seeks to resolve the economic loss claims.The GM recall applied to older models and was significantly smaller than the Toyota recall, although that could change as the investigations against GM continue, he said.GM also has offered owners of recalled vehicles $500 toward the purchase of a new GM vehicle, a factor that could mitigate any liability, he said.	-3.027017259
DETROIT (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are spicing up their compact and subcompact lineups in the United States, with Toyota Motor Corp’s Furia concept car hinting at more aggressive styling for the 2014 Corolla and Honda Motor Co taking subcompact cars to the next level with its Fit-based SUV.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, gave a glimpse of what the new Corolla, likely to go on sale later this year, could look like when it unveiled the Furia concept sedan this week at the Detroit auto show.The orange Furia has an aggressive front face with sharply angled headlights and a low center of gravity, design features that already have been applied to some recent models like the Avalon and the Auris hatchback and could help attract younger buyers.“It’s only a concept, but the Furia sends a clear message where we are going in the future. Not only is the styling more expressive, but also reflect our overall approach to the compact segment in every way,�� Bill Fay, the group vice president and general manager of the Toyota Division at Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., said on Monday.The Corolla is Toyota’s top-selling model globally and the second most-popular Toyota vehicle in the United States after the Camry. Toyota sold 290,947 Corollas in the United States in 2012, up 21 percent from a year earlier.Honda unveiled a concept urban SUV that will share platforms with the Fit subcompact car.Honda has been vocal in its emphasis on small cars, aiming to secure a quarter of its global sales with the Fit series by the financial year ending March 2017. The Fit is also known as the Jazz.Japan’s third-biggest automaker, Honda aims to sell 6 million vehicles globally by March 2017, a jump from the current 4 million, and is set to start selling the remodeled Fit by late 2013 in Japan.“There is no doubt that increasing fuel efficiency and making cars smaller to cut materials and energy used to build them is a trend in the auto industry,�� Honda Chief Executive Takanobu Ito told reporters on Monday.“The path that cars should take in the future cannot be discussed without the development of small cars, and this is not just for Honda.”The Fit-based SUV, which will be manufactured in Honda’s new Celaya plant in Mexico as well as in Japan and Asia, is set to go on sale in Japan later this year and in the United States in 2014.Nissan Motor Co, Japan’s second-biggest automaker, presented the Versa Note compact at the Detroit show on Tuesday.The Versa Note, which is a hatchback companion to the Versa sedan, is set to go on sale in the United States in the summer with a starting price of $13,990. Nissan sold 113,327 Versa vehicles in 2012 in the U.S. market, up 14 percent from a year earlier.	8.410819949
TALLADEGA, Ala. -- Tyler Reddick overcame a pit road speeding penalty and damage to the right side of his No. 2 Chevrolet to win Saturday’s MoneyLion 300 NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Talladega Superspeedway.With the right side of his Richard Childress Racing Chevy heavily taped after a brush with the outside wall, Reddick crossed the finish line at the end of a two-lap closing dash .127 seconds ahead of runner-up Gray Gaulding, who drove his No. 08 Chevrolet to the first top-10 finish of his career.The reigning series champion, who moved from JR Motorsports to RCR during the offseason, won for the first time this year, the first time at Talladega and the fourth time in his career, extending his series lead to 32 points over third-place finisher Christopher Bell.Reddick also won the $100,000 Dash4Cash bonus that goes to the highest finisher among four eligible drivers.“I tried to take us out of this race so many times, and somehow we got back into the mix and got back to the lead,�� said Reddick, who blocked for all he was worth on the final two laps after a seven-car incident on Lap 109 forced NASCAR to red-flag the event for track clean-up.In fact, Reddick had luck on his side, too. After contact with the wall, he was roughly 200 yards from going a lap down when NASCAR called the third caution of the race on Lap 66 for debris in Turn 1. Twenty laps later, Reddick escaped contact with Noah Gragson’s Chevy without significant damage.But it was dodging a Lap 95 wreck involving pole winner Michael Annett, Justin Allgaier and Cole Custer that finally gave Reddick the sense that it might be his day.“As soon as I missed that wreck when the 00 (Custer) and the 1 (Annett) got caught up, and I somehow missed it, and the 23 (John Hunter Nemechek) did a great job weaving his way out of it, too, I thought, ‘There must be a reason why I wasn’t in that wreck,’� Reddick said. “It was just a lot of fun to work my way back to the front.”Chase Briscoe finished fourth, as he Reddick, Bell and Gaulding earned the four qualifying positions for next Saturday’s Dash4Cash race at Dover, Del.Austin Cindric was fifth, followed by Nemecheck, Justin Haley, Josh Williams, Landon Cassill and Chris Cockrum, who, like Gaulding, scored his first career top 10.Gaulding had a run on the backstretch on the final lap, but a block from Briscoe slowed his momentum.“I was kind of the lone ranger out there,�� Gaulding said. “I think I just had to earn a lot of people’s respect. I did as much as I could to get beside him (Reddick), but when the 98 (Briscoe) came up, he kind of blocked my run.“Man, it was so, so close. Man, what a day, baby.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s top steelmaker Nippon Steel Corp aims to raise product prices and boost productivity by streamlining its manufacturing structure to help shore up faltering earnings, a senior executive told Reuters.Softening global steel demand for automobiles and machinery amid a prolonged U.S.-China trade row and higher raw materials costs battered the latest round of quarterly earnings at Japan’s steelmakers, forcing many to cut their annual earnings forecasts.The world’s third-biggest steelmaker, Nippon Steel forecast a 56% drop in business profit in the year through March 2020, as surging iron ore prices and slumping demand in Asia erode its margins.“Steel demand is weakening this quarter, especially overseas, and is expected to deteriorate later this year,�� Nippon Steel Executive Vice President Katsuhiro Miyamoto told Reuters in an interview on Monday.Demand for flat steel used in automobiles and machinery is slowing in China, prompting fears of an increase in regional exports at a time when the broader Asian economy is stumbling due to the U.S.-China trade war, he said.“We are worried that flat products will gradually seep out from China to the rest of Asia,�� Miyamoto said.The threat comes as the company looks to pass on a raft of higher costs.“Our current priority to help improve earnings is to raise product prices as our margins have been squeezed for a long time,�� he said, citing rising costs of raw and subsidiary materials and distribution.In semi-annual price talks with car maker Toyota Motor, Nippon Steel won a steel price rise for April-September of “a few thousand yen�� per tonne from the previous six months, according to local media. The company’s steel products averaged 88,100 yen ($836) per tonne in the April-June quarter.The agreement serves as the benchmark for other steel manufacturers, as well as for sales to the electronics and shipbuilding industries.Miyamoto confirmed Nippon Steel won a price hike in the talks, but he declined to give a figure and said the rise was not enough to repair the company’s margins.Nippon Steel also plans to raise productivity at its mills, possibly by consolidating production lines and introducing new technology, Miyamoto said.“We need to think about how we slim down the manufacturing structure to make it most productive,�� he said.To raise funds, the company plans to generate 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) by March 2021 through asset sales, mainly cross-held shares in Japanese companies.The money will be used for overseas acquisitions and upgrading the company’s domestic plants, he said.While South Korea accounts for about 10 percent of Nippon Steel’s exports, Miyamoto said a worsening Tokyo-Seoul relationship has so far not affected its business with South Korean companies.	3.057471264
WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - A Japanese auto parts maker, Toyoda Gosei Ltd, has agreed to plead guilty to price-fixing and pay a $26 million fine, the Justice Department said on Monday.Toyoda Gosei, which acknowledged conspiring to fix prices of air bags, steering wheels and automotive hoses, is the 29th auto parts maker to plead guilty to price-fixing since the Justice Department began its long-running investigation.Europe, China and other jurisdictions have also fined parts makers for price-fixing.Toyoda Gosei conspired with other parts makers to fix prices of parts sold to Toyota Motor Corp and Subaru, owned by Fuji Heavy Industries, between 2003 and 2010, the department said in a statement.In addition to companies pleading guilty, 43 people have been charged in connection with price-fixing in the sector.Among companies the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division has settled with are Autoliv, G.S Electech, Tokai Rika Co Ltd, TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, Nippon Seiki Col Ltd, Fujikura Ltd, Furukawa Electric Co Ltd and Yazaki Corp.The case is United States of America v.

PARIS, Dec 18 (Reuters) - French car orders fell in November, according to a dealership survey, signalling worse to come for suffering domestic automakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen.Passenger car orders, which prefigure delivery trends, dropped 10 percent year-on-year, according to a survey of 34 dealership groups by trade publication La Lettre VN.The core Renault brand’s domestic orders plunged by one-third last month, while the low-cost Dacia badge fell 10 percent, in line with the broader market.Peugeot’s orders fell 14 percent and Citroen’s 12 percent, according to the data.Volkswagen, which has grabbed European market share from struggling French and Italian rivals during the region’s economic crisis, saw an 18 percent gain in orders for its namesake brand, helped by the rollout of the latest Golf model.Toyota’s orders also surged 27 percent and BMW’s 9 percent.France has slipped to third place so far this year in the European car market ranking, overtaken by the U.K. in the January-November period, according to registrations data from the Brussels-based Association of European Automakers.

EditorsNote: Corrects spelling to “Leavine��; deletes second “Kyle�� reference to Busch; tweaks playoff scenarios for clarity; other minor editsIf momentum means anything at all in auto racing, then Denny Hamlin may be on his way to his first Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship.In Saturday’s Bass Pro Shops Bristol Night Race at Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, Hamlin elbowed his way past leader Matt DiBenedetto with 12 laps to go and held on for the victory.The win gave the Joe Gibbs Racing driver his second victory in the last four races and also gave him his fifth straight podium finish. Just two races now remain until the start of the 16-driver, 10-race playoffs.“Just the whole team,�� Hamlin, who started from the pole and led 79 of 500 laps, told reporters of the key to his success. “Just doing an amazing job right now. We’re just kicking ass.”It was his fourth victory of the season, tying him with teammates Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr. for most in 2019.DiBenedetto finished second and gave him a little something to feel good about as earlier in the week he was informed he would not be back as a driver for the Leavine Family Racing team next year.“I wanted to win so bad,�� DiBenedetto, whose car suffered front-end damage when he was run into by Ryan Newman with 41 laps to go, said after the race as he choked back tears. “I’m thankful but man, I’m sad. We got tight after the deal with Newman when he came up into us.“Been a tough week. I just want to stick around and keep doing this. I love it. I’m not done yet. Something will come open.”After his win, Hamlin said, “I’m so sorry to Matt DiBenedetto. I hate it.”Brad Keselowski of Team Penske finished third while Busch was fourth and Chase Elliott of Hendrick Motorsports was fifth.Busch, who had won three of the previous four races at Bristol, appeared to be headed to another victory in the final stage. But on a restart on Lap 388, his Toyota twitched and sent Busch from second to fifth.“We were just too lose at the end,�� Busch said. “Car just wasn’t there all weekend long. Just never found what I was looking for.”Stewart-Haas Racing’s Kevin Harvick, who had two wins in the four races prior to Bristol, appeared to be fast enough to add another win as he led 28 laps. But just before the end of Stage 2, he pitted and then had to be pushed to the garage with a transmission problem.Four drivers -- Ryan Newman, Clint Bowyer, Daniel Suarez and Jimmie Johnson -- started the race on the playoff bubble, Newman and Bowyer sitting in 15th and 16th and Suarez and Johnson within 12 points of the cutoff.Kendrick Motorsports�� Johnson fared the worst, getting caught up in a fender bender on Lap 80. The seven-time Cup champion sunk downward from there and finished 19th, four laps off the pace.Newman headed out of Tennessee 15th in points -- 14 above the cut line. Suarez is 16th in points while Bowyer is two behind and Johnson 26 behind.--Field Level Media	6.309780932
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is recalling about 803,000 sedans, mostly its Camry, in the United States from the model years 2012 and 2013 due to potential problems with air conditioning condensers, the company said on Thursday.Globally, the recall involves about 885,000 Camry, Avalon and Venza sedans, including 44,000 in Canada, 10,600 in Mexico, 9,100 in Saudi Arabia and the rest scattered among 15 countries.Water from the condenser can leak onto the airbag control module, which could cause the airbag to inflate and deploy at the wrong time, Toyota said. Also, power steering may be affected by a leaky condenser.Toyota said the issue has led to two “minor�� injuries and no accidents.	-1.443792464

(Reuters) - Automakers and technology companies racing to develop self-driving vehicles are running into a problem: cars that can think are no good without affordable and reliable technology that allows cars to see.With the notable exception of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc, most automakers have said their self-driving cars will rely on a detection system known as lidar. The state of the art sensors use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car.Pressure to launch self-driving cars is already pushing many players to place bets on the technology. General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and BMW are expected to deploy sensors from well-funded lidar startups Velodyne and Innoviz on their initial self-driving cars over the next two years.More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been plowed into some 50 lidar startups over the past three years, including a record $420 million in 2018, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data.For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2EAsKuCVelodyne and Swedish supplier Veoneer Inc will provide lidar for Ford’s first automated vehicle in mid-2021, according to a source familiar with the project. Velodyne President Marta Hall describes the program as “a billion-dollar-plus deal�� for the privately held lidar pioneer, whose $75,000 HDL-64E can be seen on the roofs of many self-driving prototypes in Silicon Valley.But automakers and large suppliers have yet to settle on a winning technology, meaning there are no real sector standards for the sensors to date that would encourage mass production and lower the cost.The initial payoff for investors and startups looks thin. Automotive lidar is expected to generate only $2.5 billion in revenue by 2025, according to industry researcher IHS Markit.“You can overcome certain things with additional capital, but you can’t overcome physics�� in trying to rapidly develop, package and implement the latest lidar technology, said Austin Russell, chief executive and co-founder of lidar startup Luminar, which has funding from Volvo Cars and development deals with Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG’s Audi brand.“That’s the fundamental barrier that’s holding the vast majority of the industry behind.”Interviews with two dozen executives at startups, automakers, suppliers, investment and research firms underscored that there is plenty of chatter, but little consensus on lidar.Toyota has partnered with several lidar startups, including Blackmore and Luminar, but the Japanese automaker continues to evaluate new sensing technologies and is not keen for a shakeout to start yet, said Ryan Eustice, senior vice president of automated driving at Toyota Research Institute.“We want to see an ecosystem happen. There’s a diversity of technology that we’d like to gauge (and) different strengths and weaknesses in how you approach the technology. It’s also good to have competitive market pressure,�� Eustice said.Eventually, the lidar sector could be squeezed down to just five or six key players �� as happened with the far more mature radar sensor technology. But that is not likely to unfold until after 2025 and perhaps not until 2030, executives and researchers told Reuters.“It’s going to be a long runway,�� IHS Senior Analyst Jeremy Carlson said.That presents a big risk: investing in technology that may be obsolete by the time large numbers of those vehicles start rolling off assembly lines after 2025.If a vehicle assembler gets “too wrapped up in a technology, you might be at a disadvantage�� because a newer, less expensive system could come along, said Chris Heiser, CEO of automated vehicle software company Renovo.Even experts do not seem to agree on the etymology of the name lidar, which is either a mashup of light and radar, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, or an acronym for light detection and ranging (or, in some references, laser detection and ranging).Nor is there full agreement on whether lidar is really necessary to make self-driving cars work.Tesla CEO Musk insists the electric carmaker’s so-called “Autopilot�� system does not need it, relying instead on a combination of radar, cameras and software.Lidar remains a relatively young technology that is still in flux, with bulky electromechanical devices such as Velodyne’s popular rooftop unit rapidly transitioning to newer, more compact and more capable solid-state devices designed to sell for less than $10,000 in limited quantities, and eventually as little as $200 in mass production.“This requires quantum leaps in innovation in lidar technology,�� Thomas Sedran, in charge of evaluating Volkswagen’s autonomous strategy in commercial vehicles, told Reuters Tuesday at the Geneva motor show of the need to cut costs.Aptiv PLC has been among the most active suppliers in developing automated driving systems, investing in three lidar startups: Innoviz, Quanergy and LeddarTech. It is also a key supplier of automotive radar, a sensing technology often paired with lidar.Glen De Vos, Aptiv’s chief technology officer, said lidar could follow radar’s extended maturation process, with technology, size, cost and reliability optimized over time as demand and production volume ramp up.“It takes a few generations and iterations for that cost curve to come down,�� he said. “It could be a five- to 10-year process.��	3.865061875
* Japanese companies have a record $730 billion in cash* PM Abe wants corporate capital spending to help fuel growth* Japan’s companies, wary of weak demand, are spending less* Overall investment remains 10 pct below 2007 levels* Companies like Daikin seeking to work existing assets harderBy Kevin Krolicki and Tetsushi KajimotoKUSATSU, Japan, April 5 (Reuters) - Hirotoshi Ogura, a self-described “factory geek��, is Daikin Industries�� master of doing more with less - and part of the reason Japan’s recovery remains stuck in the slow lane.As Japan heads into the season of peak demand for room air-conditioners, Ogura and other Daikin managers have been tasked with figuring out how to boost output by some 20 percent at a plant in western Japan that six years ago the company had almost given up on as unprofitable.The wrinkle: they have no budget for new capital investment at the 45-year-old Kusatsu plant. The still-evolving workaround shown to a recent visitor involves home-made robots for ferrying parts, experimental systems using gravity rather than electricity to power parts of the line, more temporary workers on seasonal contracts and dozens of steps to chip away at the 1.63 hours it takes to make a typical new air conditioner.“We can do a lot without spending anything,�� says Ogura, a 33-year Daikin veteran who joined the company just after high school. “Anything we need, we first try to build ourselves.”Like Daikin, a number of Japanese manufacturers are shifting production back to Japan from China and elsewhere to take advantage of a weaker yen. Rival Panasonic has pulled back some production of room air-conditioners, Sharp has brought back production of some refrigerators, and Canon has repatriated some output of high-end copiers, according to a list compiled by Nomura.But even as output recovers, Japanese companies remain cautious about new capital investment in factories and equipment. The trend is especially pronounced for smaller firms down the supply chain.After increasing capital spending by 6 percent in the just-completed fiscal year, small manufacturers plan a 14 percent decrease in the current year, according to the Bank of Japan’s quarterly survey released this week. Big manufacturers like Daikin plan a 5 percent increase, but overall investment remains 10 percent below pre-crisis 2007 levels.Over the same time, corporate earnings have increased by 11 percent, shares have rallied - Daikin’s are up more than four-fold from its 2008 low - and Japanese companies have socked away a record 87 trillion yen ($730 billion) in cash.For Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic revival plan to work, pulling Japan out of decades of stagnation and deflation, companies need to be willing to use that cash for new investment in a way they have so far baulked at in the more than two years since he took office, economists say.“It turned out that the government and the BOJ were wrong in thinking monetary easing would boost capital spending,�� said Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute. “Low growth expectations appear to outweigh the benefit from lower interest rates, keeping companies from boosting capital spending.”For Daikin, there is a wariness that the slumping demand and sharply higher yen that almost forced the closure of the Kusatsu plant in 2009 could return at any time. Sales in Japan represent just 25 percent of Daikin’s air-conditioning sales now, down from over a third in 2009.But managers also say the lean years have forced the company to innovate at its four home factories, a theme mirrored at Daikin’s production mentor, Toyota Motor.At the urging of Toyota president Akio Toyoda, Japan’s top automaker last week unveiled the results of a five-year-old programme to re-engineer the way it makes cars to cut the costs of retooling existing factories and building new ones.Already running its factories at 90 percent of capacity, Toyota expects to be able to cut the cost to retool an existing production line for a new model by half of what it cost in 2009 and cut the investment needed for the new plants it is planning for Mexico and China by 40 percent from earlier levels.Like Daikin, the savings at Toyota will come by a thousand cuts, from smaller and more efficient paint booths to a faster and more flexible robot welding system that will also be installed at factories in Japan.Atsushi Takeda, chief economist for the Itochu Economic Research Institute, said there was not much Abe’s government could do to shake companies out of their caution, apart from cutting regulations and encouraging new industries, areas where progress has been slow. Most Japanese companies still see better growth outside Japan and are investing accordingly.“Companies were so hard hit by the excessive yen strength after the Lehman shock they want to be convinced there won’t be a reversal of the weak yen over the next five to 10 years,�� Takeda said. “They are in no mood to take risk.�� ($1 = 119.6800 yen) (Editing by Will Waterman)	-2.197098976
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T lowered its annual profit forecast while Honda Motor Co 7267.T turned in a double-digit decline in quarterly earnings as a resurgent yen hurt two of Japan's biggest automakers.The quarterly earnings unveiled on Friday by Japan’s biggest and third-biggest automakers highlight how “safe-haven�� demand for the currency - buoyed by global uncertainties and falling U.S. interest rates - could eat into profits at Japanese exporters in the months to come.A strengthening yen hurts Japanese automakers as cars exported from Japan become more expensive, while it also decreases the value of earnings made overseas.Toyota cut its operating profit forecast for the year ending March 2020 by nearly 6% to 2.4 trillion yen ($22.4 billion), from a previous forecast of 2.55 trillion yen. The 2.7% drop on the year means it will snap a three-year run of rising profit.“We have factored in cost reduction efforts for the year, but there are still some uncertainties. We cannot be complacent,�� Toyota Operating Officer Kenta Kon told reporters at a results briefing.It expects the yen to trade around 106 to the U.S. dollar and 121 to the euro in the current financial year, from a previous assumption of 110 yen and 125 yen, respectively.For the quarter just ended, however, Toyota posted an 8.7% rise in operating profit to 741.9 billion yen ($6.93 billion), its highest since the September 2015 quarter, helped by a slight increase in global vehicle sales.(For a link to an interactive graph on Toyota's financial performance, click on tmsnrt.rs/2Xzf8Xl)But the stronger domestic currency took a toll on Honda’s profits. Japan’s No. 3 automaker posted an operating income of 252.4 billion yen for the April-June period, down 16% from 299.3 billion yen a year ago and lagging analyst forecasts.Still, Honda reiterated its forecast for a 6% increase in operating profit to 770 billion yen for this fiscal year, and said it expected the yen to average around 110 to the U.S. dollar, unchanged from its previous forecast.(For a link to an interactive graph on Honda's financial performance, click on tmsnrt.rs/310ZCoU)Easing demand for cars has also dented earnings at Honda and other automakers including Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Ford Motor Co F.N, prompting the latter two to announce job cuts and plant closures.An escalating trade war between China and the United States, the world’s top two auto markets, and slowing economic growth have prompted a broad-based sales downturn in the global auto sector.“Conditions in the U.S. market continue to be severe, including the effects of the trade friction between the U.S. and China,�� Honda Executive Vice President Seiji Kuraishi told reporters, adding that tensions could also have a negative impact in China, where demand for cars is already slowing.“How the Chinese market reacts to the U.S.-China trade friction will be key to setting our business strategy.”A downturn in the global auto sector could weigh on profits just as automakers invest heavily in new technologies including electric cars, autonomous driving technologies and ride-sharing services to survive a industry shift away from car ownership.Toyota has been pouring money in ride-sharing services including Uber UBER.N, Grab and Didi Chuxing while deepening alliances with SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T to develop on-demand transportation services in Japan, to position itself as a provider of mobility services. Investors have backed this strategy, pushing Toyota shares roughly 10% higher this year, outperforming its domestic rivals.Honda too has been scrambling to reinvent itself to compete with tech firms such as Google parent Alphabet GOOGL.O and Uber, by expanding partnerships and investing in General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise self-driving vehicle unit.	2.031795269
SYDNEY, July 2 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose on Thursday, tracking overnight gains in Wall Street, on signs that the global economy was emerging from the coronavirus lockdown, although many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. payrolls data later in the day.The benchmark Nikkei average advanced 0.65% to 22,266.23 by the midday break, clawing back from a 0.75% drop on Wednesday, with cyclical stocks leading the gains.Soichiro Matsumoto, chief investment officer Japan at Credit Suisse, called the current Nikkei’s level of around 22,000 “a pretty good level�� for many institutional investors. He expects Tokyo shares to remain range-bound, saying there’s not much upside left in the medium term.On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes ended higher on Wednesday as increasing optimism for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine eased concerns that another round of business lockdowns was likely.The U.S. manufacturing activity rebounded more than expected in June, while similar surveys from China, Germany and France all pointed to a recovery in factory activity.The broader Topix gained 0.77% to 1,550.40 by the midday recess, with all but four of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo exchange trading higher.Highly cyclical air transport, sea transport and transport equipment indexes were the three top performers on the main bourse.Toyota Motor Corp advanced 2.3%, one day after U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc overtook the Japanese carmaker to become the highest-valued automaker in terms of market capitalization.Bucking the overall trend, the index of Mothers start-up market slumped 5.2%, hitting its lowest level since May 28, with biotech AnGes Inc nose-diving as much as 16%.Large-cap stocks outperformed the small-cap shares, with the Topix Large index rising 0.83% and the Topix Small falling 0.23%.

BEIJING, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The former deputy head of China’s top planning agency confessed in court on Wednesday to extensive bribery, one of the highest-profile officials to be prosecuted for corruption since President Xi Jinping launched an anti-graft campaign.Prosecutors charged Liu and his son, Liu Decheng, with taking 35.6 million yuan ($5.8 million) in bribes in dealings with various companies, including a Toyota Motor Corp joint venture, the court said.Liu Tienan, 59, was sacked from his job deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a post that carries ministerial-level status, in May last year.The NDRC is a powerful body that sets broad economic policies and approves major investments. Liu was also head of the National Energy Administration regulator.“The oral representation made by the defendant Liu Tienan on the allegations is: I have taken the initiative to confess to the facts of the allegations,�� the court said on its microblog as it laid out the charges against Liu.The closely watched trial in being held in Langfang city in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing.Liu was sacked after a deputy editor-in-chief of the investigative magazine Caijing posted accusations on his microblog that Liu was involved in illegal activities.He was the first ministerial-level official to face an investigation after Xi became Communist Party head in late 2012 and pledged to take down high-ranking “tigers�� and low-ranking “flies�� in his fight against a pervasive problem he says could threaten Communist Party rule.Liu is the third ministerial-level official to stand trial for graft, according to Chinese media.Prosecutors said Liu, together with his son, Liu Decheng, facilitated deals on projects that included the sale of 30,000 tonnes of aluminium oxide to the Nanshan Group, parent of Shandong Nanshan Aluminium Co. Ltd..In return, the father and son were paid bribes of 7.5 million yuan by Song Zuowen, chairman of Nanshan Group, the court heard.In 2002, Liu Tienan, as a senior official in the top economic planning agency, had helped Nanshan Group get approval for an alloy project after a request from Song, according to the court.In 2005, Liu Tienan accepted a request from Sun Yonggen, chairman of the Ningbo ZhongJin Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to approve a petrochemical plant, the court said. In return, Sun bought Liu Decheng a car for 336,000 yuan.Liu also put Zhang Aibin, the controlling shareholder of a car dealership in Beijing, in touch with Zhang Fangyou, the chairman of GAC Toyota Motor Co. Ltd, a joint venture between GAC Group and Toyota, so Zhang could set up a GAC Toyota Motor shop, according to the court transcript.Tokyo-based Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the company was checking the facts: “So we would like to refrain from commenting.”The trial has offered a rare glimpse into the amount of power amassed by top officials, especially within the NDRC. The agency sets policy for strategic industries, approves big investments, mergers and acquisitions, and has the authority to influence prices for everything from liquor to gasoline.Since Xi launched his campaign against corruption, 49 ministerial-level officials have “fallen��, according to People’s Daily newspaper.Liu Tienan is certain to be found guilty as the Communist Party controls the courts, which do not challenge party accusations, especially in graft cases.Under Chinese law, Liu could face the death sentence if convicted of corruption. But media, citing unidentified sources close to the case, said Liu was expected to get a lenient sentence because “his attitude on pleading guilty has been very good since the investigation started��.State media reported that Liu had taken bribes for helping a businessman to defraud banks of loans of more than $200 million in 2011 for an investment in Canada.Key information on that case initially came from a former mistress in Japan, media reported.

JOHANNESBURG, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s South African unit said on Monday all its vehicles in Africa’s most advanced economy are compliant with environmental laws, following the emissions testing scandal, which has rocked the global car industry.The South African business said its vehicles comply with the published CO2 values and were technically safe and roadworthy.“There is therefore no action required on either the part of the customer or our dealers,�� the company said in a statement.Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, faces the worst business crisis in its 78-year history after it admitted cheating diesel emissions tests for nitrogen oxides in the United States, with 11 million vehicles affected worldwide.A South African regulator last week said they were investigating Volkswagen’s local cars to see if they also rigged carbon emissions data.“All Volkswagen Group diesel vehicles of the type EA 189 retailed in South Africa, that is, Volkswagen passenger, Audi, Light and Medium Commercial Vehicles comply with this standard for nitrogen oxide emissions,�� the company said.Volkswagen was the second most popular car brand in South Africa after Toyota, selling 8,472 out of 51,055 vehicles in the market during August, data from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa showed.

* Union plans protest marches, picketing* NUMSA rejected latest pay offer on Sunday* Strike has forced Toyota, GM, Ford to halt production (changes dateline, adds details)CAPE TOWN, July 16 (Reuters) - South Africa’s main manufacturing union, NUMSA, said it has agreed a plan of action to intensify a three-week strike over pay that has hit car makers and construction companies.Around 220,000 workers have downed tools in demand of a double-digit wage increase, a blow to Africa’s most advanced economy as it struggles to avoid recession and is still recovering from a crippling five-month strike in the platinum sector, which ended in June.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) rejected a pay offer from employers on Sunday and said on Wednesday that it would immediately start mobilising workers for protest marches across the country. It also plans to hold lunch-time pickets and demonstrations in the auto, rubber, tyre and power sectors.“The National Strike Committee ... has developed a maximum programme of action to intensify and accelerate the strike action,�� NUMSA said in a statement on Wednesday.On Tuesday, employers in the metals and engineering sector withdrew their offer of a 10 percent annual wage increase this year, 9.5 percent in 2015 and 9 percent the following year, after NUMSA rejected it.The strike has disrupted the supply of components to automobile makers, pushing Toyota, General Motors and Ford to halt production at their assembly plants in South Africa.Workers participating in the strike also include those from construction companies developing a new state coal-fired power station, Medupi, as well as workers from packaging company Nampak.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, however, said on Wednesday that the strike would not affect the start of operations at the power station, which is slated for December.As well as wage increases, the strike is also about labour issues, including third-party hiring and contract workers, and housing allowances.NUMSA also wants any deal to be limited to one year while employers, who said they would take their fight to the bargaining council, are keen to lock in a multi-year agreement.

(This is a repeat of an item issued on Monday)NEW DELHI, May 11 (Reuters) - India’s automakers have warned that total automobile sales could fall as much as 45% in the current fiscal year in a worst-case scenario as economic growth slumps due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are seeking government help through the crisis.The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an industry trade body, told government officials last week that if India’s economy contracts by 2% in the year starting April 1, sales of cars, trucks and motorbikes could decline by as much as 45% from a year before.SIAM presented two more scenarios to the government -- one where the economy grows by 2%-3%, which would lead to a 20% decline in auto sales, and a second where growth stagnates from last year, resulting in a 35% decline in sales.The trade body represents most major automakers in India, including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp and the local units of Toyota Motor, Hyundai Motor, Ford and Volkswagen.Global consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co estimated in April that if India’s lockdown was extended until mid-May, the economy could shrink by 2%-3% in the current fiscal year, while rating agency Moody’s said on Friday the country could see 0% growth.India’s auto industry is already reeling, with sales of cars, SUVs, trucks and motorbikes falling 18% last fiscal year to 21.5 million vehicles due to an economic slowdown. The pandemic, which has seen businesses shuttered and people told to stay at home all over the world, is set to make things worse.If the combined decline over two years is 40%-45%, it could push auto sales numbers to their lowest level in a decade, SIAM’s president Rajan Wadhera told road transport ministry officials, according to the recording of a web conference they held last week.During the meeting, auto industry executives sought tax cuts, a one-year delay in implementing certain safety and fuel efficiency regulations, and loans at low interest rates to help the sector revive production and prevent layoffs until sales and revenues pick up.“The biggest problem we are facing right now is cashflow liquidity,�� Mahindra &amp; Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka, a former president of SIAM, said during the meeting.Nearly all automakers recorded zero domestic sales in April after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25 to control the spread of the coronavirus. Since May 4, it has allowed some economic activity to resume in places where there are zero or few cases of people being infected.While a handful of companies like Maruti and Hyundai either plan to or have restarted production, many automakers are still waiting for supply chain disruptions to settle and signs of demand to return before they start manufacturing.

Jan 20 (Reuters) - Australia’s Orocobre Ltd said on Monday that two contracts were signed for the supply of battery grade lithium carbonate to Chinese cathode manufacturers from its flagship Olaroz Lithium project.The Olaroz project in Argentina is a joint venture between Orocobre, Japan’s Toyota Tsusho Corp, and Jujuy Energia y Minera Sociedad del Estado, a mining investment firm owned by the local government.Orocobre said Toyota Tsusho signed one contract for supply of 7,200 tonnes of battery grade lithium carbonate and a second order for 2,880 tonnes of micronised battery grade lithium carbonate.The orders will be delivered over three years with the first shipment expected in the March quarter, the company said in a statement.Last month, Orocobre cut its lithium carbonate sales price for the December quarter to ensure retention of market share, as prices of the metal used in batteries of electric vehicles have plummeted due to lower demand from Chinese customers.

* Expects 2016 sales of 10.09 mln vehicles* Sales to increase in main markets due to new SUV* Toyota was world’s top-selling automaker in 2015 (Adds details on sales forecast)TOKYO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Thursday said it anticipates a 1 percent rise in global vehicle sales next year, as growth in North America, China, Europe and Asia prompts a recovery from a 1 percent slide in sales this year.The Japanese automaker estimates sales across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu minicar and Hino Motors Ltd truck brands to increase to around 10.2 million vehicles in 2017. It expects to end 2016 with sales of 10.09 million vehicles, slightly lower than an initial forecast of 10.11 million.Toyota expects sales to increase in its main markets next year due in part to new additions to its model line-up, including the C-HR compact sport utility vehicle launched in Japan this week.This would offset sluggish demand in the Middle East, where low oil prices have battered the region’s economies, the automaker said.It aims to boost production at the group by 1 percent to 10.366 million vehicles in 2017.The improvement in global sales would follow a 1 percent year-on-year slide this year, largely due to sluggishness in some Southeast Asian markets.Toyota was the world’s top-selling automaker in 2015, keeping the title for the fourth straight year.In the year to October, Toyota sold 8.35 million vehicles, slightly lower than 8.48 million at Volkswagen AG during the same period, latest data showed.

(Adds Autodata annualized sales rate in second paragraph)DETROIT, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The top six automakers sold more cars and trucks in November than analysts expected, with a healthy economy, generous discounts and low fuel prices luring consumers into U.S. showrooms.The industry’s annualized sales rate in November was about 17.2 million vehicles, according to industry consultant Autodata Corp. That is the best pace for that month since 2003 and well ahead of the estimated 16.7 million in a Thomson Reuters survey of 41 industry economists and analysts.November sales totaled 1.3 million, up 4.6 percent from a year ago and higher than analysts�� expectations of 1.27 million.“This sustained demand for new vehicles was building for years during the recession, and it should continue unless a major shift in economic stability occurs,�� said analyst Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book.General Motors Co, Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co all reported year-to-year sales gains in November, while Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd had modest declines. All six topped forecasts from analysts surveyed by Reuters.Early buzz and promotions tied to the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday�� retail blitz helped spur car sales, according to John Krafcik, president of online shopping service TrueCar.com. Krafcik said average transaction prices on full-size pickups in November topped $40,000 for the first time.GM on Tuesday said November sales rose 6.5 percent to 225,818 vehicles. Sales of GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups climbed 34 percent to 65,343.“Lower gasoline prices are helping the entire market, not just SUVs and trucks,�� said GM spokesman Jim Cain, who also cited improving consumer confidence, higher wages and lower unemployment.Chrysler Group sales rose 20.1 percent to 170,839 vehicles on strong showings by its Jeep utility vehicles and Ram trucks. Ram pickup sales were up 21 percent, while Jeep SUV sales jumped 27 percent.Ford reported a slight decline in sales to 186,334 vehicles, about what analysts had expected. Sales of the best-selling F-150 pickup were down 10 percent to 59,049 as the automaker began a changeover to the redesigned 2015 model.Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said plunging fuel prices have provided a “financial windfall�� for buyers, bolstered by still-low interest rates.“By any measure, households are reaping significant disposable income gains each week at current gas prices,�� she said.Toyota said sales rose 3 percent to 183,343, while Honda reported an increase of nearly 9 percent to 121,814. Nissan said sales were down 3 percent to 103,188. All three companies beat analysts�� expectations. (Writing by Paul Lienert; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)	-1.597369039

PRAGUE, June 12 (Reuters) - The Czech car sector’s revenue rose 15 percent to a record 991 billion crowns ($41 billion) in 2014, the country’s Automotive Industry Association (AutoSAP) said on Friday.Exports in the sector also grew 15 percent to 845 billion crowns last year, AutoSAP said.The car industry -- whose 2014 revenue is just below this year’s planned state budget spending of 1.2 trillion crowns -- is a major driver for the Czech economy, accounting for a quarter of manufacturing and almost a quarter of exports.Volkswagen unit Skoda Auto is the biggest Czech carmaker and largest exporter.Hyundai Motor and TPCA -- a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corp and PSA Peugeot Citroen -- are the other car producers and the country is home to a vast supply chain.Car production reached a record 1.25 million vehicles in 2014, up 10.5 percent, thanks to recovery in markets in Europe and further afield.AutoSAP has said it expects production to increase further this year, although at a lower growth rate than in 2014.In 2014, the Czech economy grew by 2.0 percent, and increased by 4.2 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, the second fastest expansion pace in the European Union.	-1.527562542
(Reuters) - A Montana man whose wife was jailed on suspicion of driving under the influence was arrested for the exact same offense after going to the jail drunk to bail her out, a local newspaper reported on Friday.A Gallatin County sheriff’s deputy arrested Stacey Jo Fancher, 44, in Big Sky on Thursday night when she failed a breathalizer test after being stopped by the police, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported on its website, citing charging documents.Her husband, Rick Fancher, arrived at the local jail early on Friday and tried to bail her out, the paper reported, and staff there took a breath sample from him and found he also had a blood alcohol level above the legal limit for driving.Nevertheless, he drove away in a Toyota truck and the same deputy who arrested his wife hours earlier pulled over the man, who admitted that he had nine beers and three or four shots of bourbon the night before, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported.Fancher also was arrested and the couple posted bail and were released from jail on Friday morning, the paper said.Gallatin County Sheriff Brian Gootkin did not return a call or email about the case.The Fanchers could not be reached for comment.	3.948287911

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales will show a 1 percent decline in February from a year earlier, industry consultant and car shopping website Edmunds said on Thursday.Edmunds estimated that February U.S. sales would be 1.33 million vehicles, for a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.6 million. That sales rate is close to the 2016 full-year sales of 17.55 million vehicles, as reported by Autodata Corp.Sales are expected to be 17 percent higher on a volume basis from January, which had sales of 1.14 million vehicles.General Motors Co's GM.N sales are seen rising 5.7 percent, while Ford Motor Co's F.N are expected to decline by 3.4 percent, Edmunds said.Automakers in the U.S. market report February sales on March 1.GM was the only automaker among the top eight companies by sales in the U.S. market expected to report improved sales from last February, Edmunds said.GM’s stronger sales are because of more generous incentives, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director for industry analysis at Edmunds. Discounts are especially strong for Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks, Caldwell said. The Silverado is GM’s highest-volume model.Edmunds said Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU.NFCHA.MI sales will fall 9.5 percent, and that Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T new vehicle sales in February will drop 4.4 percent.	-1.793091325
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor on Thursday said it aims to sell 77,000 of its first dedicated gasoline-electric car globally next year, 80 percent more than their total hybrid car sales in 2015, as it tries to meet emissions regulations in key markets.The South Korean automaker also expected the IONIQ to achieve a fuel efficiency of an estimated 57 miles per gallon in the United States, edging out an estimated 52 mpg for Toyota Motor’s redesigned Prius, the world’s top-selling gasoline hybrid which goes on sale in the U.S. market this month.Tough fuel economy and emissions regulations in the United States, Europe and South Korea are compelling automakers to push fuel-efficient cars even as low oil prices undercut demand.The stakes are higher for Hyundai Motor, which has invested heavily to build a hybrid-only model to take on dominant leader Toyota Motor Corp.Hyundai said it has built a tailor-made platform, engine and other key parts for the car, to help achieve a better fuel economy than the latest Prius.“We are somewhat late to the market but we have been catching up very quickly,�� Ryu Chang-sung, a director at Hyundai Motor, said.The compact car, which was unveiled last week and launched in Korea on Thursday, will be rolled out in other markets like the United States and China.Hyundai aims to sell 30,000 IONIQs this year. Next year the target is 62,000 overseas and 15,000 at home, or about 80 percent higher than the 42,778 hybrid cars Hyundai sold in 2015.The South Korean automaker has so far launched hybrid variants of their existing models like the Sonata and the Azera, but the 1.6-litre IONIQ is the first hybrid-exclusive car it has made from scratch.Hyundai aims to become the No.2 player in the global green car market by 2020, by raising their range to more than 26 models.Green cars would account for about 10 percent of its total car sales in 2020, up from 2 percent now, the company says.	-6.948146874

* Volume likely to be subdued with holidays in China* Japanese companies�� weak earnings hurt sentiment - analyst* Toyota underperforms after reporting weak 3Q resultsTOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell to a more than a two-week low on Monday on concerns about weak earnings and after the U.S. jobs report failed to give clues on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy outlook.The Nikkei dropped 1.2 percent to 16,625.87 points by midmorning after falling as low as 16,552.30 earlier, the lowest since Jan. 22. It has fallen for five straight sessions.Trading volume is likely to be subdued with many regional markets in Asia closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.On Friday, U.S. employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded, but rising wages and an unemployment rate at an eight-year low suggested the labor market recovery remains firm.Analysts said that despite a rebound in the dollar against the yen, the move is not strong enough to trigger buying in exporters. The greenback rebounded to 116.920, from a 2-1/2 week trough of 116.285.“We didn’t get much clues on future U.S. rate hikes from the jobs report, so investors are having hard times deciding their positions,�� said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities.“Japanese companies�� earnings reports are not helping sentiment, either, so the market may stay sluggish for a while.”He said that with companies reporting tepid earnings for the Oct-Dec quarter and cutting their full-year forecasts, investors are bracing for the market to price them in.Toyota Motor Corp underperformed the market, stumbling 4.5 percent after reporting a lower-than-expected operating profit for the Oct-Dec quarter.Nonferrous metal smelting company Dowa Holdings dived 17 percent after the it cut the operating profit outlook to 35.5 billion yen from 38.5 billion yen for the year ending March due to falling nonferrous metal prices and a slowdown in demand from China and Southeast Asia.Bucking the weakness, Hakuhodo DY Holdings soared 6.7 percent after the advertising agency raised its operating profit forecast to 41.5 billion yen from 38.8 billion yen for the year ending March.The broader Topix shed 0.7 percent to 1,360.83 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 0.5 percent to 12,293.37.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T plans to supply hybrid technology to BMW AG BMWG.DE, deepening a partnership that began with a deal last December on diesel engines and electric car batteries, the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday.This month, BMW's joint venture to make hybrid car components with French auto maker PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA was thrown into doubt by the prospect of deepening ties between PSA and its European rival Opel, a division of General Motors GM.N.Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota, and Norbert Reithofer, chief executive of BMW, plan to hold a news conference in Germany this week to announce the new project, the paper said without citing sources.Toyota was not immediately available for comment.In December, the German premium car maker agreed to supply diesel engines to Toyota from 2014 in Europe and collaborate on lithium-ion battery research for electric cars.Global automakers face ballooning research and development costs to meet tougher emissions and fuel-economy standards around the world.This has accelerated cooperation deals among car makers, including Toyota and BMW's main rivals, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, along with Nissan's French partner, Renault SA RENA.PA.	-4.704954659
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian police are investigating the theft of tens of thousands of liters of drinking water from a council site on the far north coast of the drought- and bushfire stricken state of New South Wales.The devastating bushfires have killed at least four people since November, burnt about 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of farmland and bush, and destroyed more than 400 homes.Police said offenders in a water tanker and a Toyota Hilux utility stole about 25,000 liters of drinking water from a property in the town of Murwillumbah on the state’s far northern coast.The act of stealing water during a time of hardship for much of New South Wales was “shocking,�� said Detective Chief Inspector Luke Arthurs.“This kind of theft is not acceptable,�� he added. “Police will continue to investigate this incident and are pleading with anyone with information to contact us.”Sydney was blanketed in smoke this week as the state registered some of the worst air quality in the world, heightening public anger and raising political pressure on the government to do more to battle climate change.While police are investigating what triggered some fires, firefighters and scientists have blamed the bulk of the blazes on soaring temperatures and three years of drought that left bushland tinder-box dry.	-1.083743842

EditorsNote: Resending: Daniel Henrick was misspelled in the seventh graph; it’s Daniel HemricLate pass puts Reddick in Winner’s CircleBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed for The Sports XchangeDOVER, Del. -- Tyler Reddick had a score to settle with Dover International Speedway, and on Friday he did just that, winning the Lucas Oil 200 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race in his second start at the Monster Mile.Reddick passed Erik Jones on Lap 193 of 200 and finished 1.255 seconds ahead of Daniel Suarez, who drove past third-place finisher Jones in the closing laps to take the runner-up spot.The victory was Reddick’s second of the season in the No. 19 Brad Keselowski Racing Ford, and in the driver’s view, it atoned for last year’s eighth-place finish, in which Reddick underestimated the physical toll high-speed racing at Dover can exact.Specifically, his leg fell asleep as the race progressed.“After what happened to myself last year, not knowing a lot about the g-forces in the corners here -- I was kind of green when it came to asphalt racing,�� Reddick said. “We had a top-five truck last year, and to have something like that impede our progress in what would have been our first top five ... to have something like that mess up what could have been potentially a breakout day for us are the things you can’t have happen in racing.“I really wanted to come back here and run really strong, just like I want to run strong every given race. But (last year) gave me a little bit of extra fuel for the fire, and I knew I had to run good here-and we did.”Daniel Hemric posted a career-best fourth-place NCWTS finish in his first race at Dover. Series leader Matt Crafton ran fifth but saw his margin narrowed to 11 points by Reddick, who is second after six races.Ben Kennedy came home sixth, followed by Keystone Light polesitter Ryan Blaney, Brandon Jones, Johnny Sauter and Tyler Young. Suarez, Jones, Kennedy and Blaney, who finished among the top seven, are all NASCAR Next alums.Though Jones, lost one position to Reddick in the series standings, he moved closer to Crafton, now trailing the two-time defending champion by 14 points. Sauter is fourth, 40 points behind Crafton, and could be considered the only other driver within realistic striking distance of the leader at this point in the season.Like Jones, Suarez used a two-tire call to gain track position in the late stages of the race but felt race traffic hindered him in the closing laps.“To be honest, I feel like we had a faster truck,�� said Suarez, a member of the 2014 NASCAR Drive for Diversity class, who posted his best finish to date in the series. “Traffic was everything. I was talking with my crew chief Jerry Baxter through the radio during the middle of the race. I told him, ‘I don’t care about tires, I need the track position.’�For sure the track position was very important. Erik Jones he changed just two tires in the last pit stop and he was able to almost get the win and he was driving away, but traffic was a big problem for him and for me and I feel like for everyone. Traffic was something that was a gamble, but overall I feel like we learned some good stuff for tomorrow (in the NASCAR XFINITY Series race).”NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- Lucas Oil 200Dover International SpeedwayDover, DelawareFriday, May 29, 20151.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE is considering launching a new bid for Malaysia's Proton as Europe's largest car maker aims to tap growing southeast Asian markets in its quest for global dominance, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.VW, which failed in 2007 to form a tie-up with Proton, might seek either a minority holding in the owner of UK sports-car manufacturer Lotus or a controlling stake, two sources said on condition they not be identified.Wolfsburg-based VW assembles the Passat sedan in partnership with Malaysian automotive and property conglomerate DRB-HICOM DRBM.KL at the company's plant in Pekan. VW, which does not have a factory in Malaysia, also plans to produce the Jetta and Polo models at DRB-HICOM's factory.“Toyota has declared the area as its own backyard,�� said Christoph Stuermer, a Frankfurt-based analyst at research firm IHS Automotive. “But southeast Asia plays a considerable role in VW’s global expansion plan; they can’t afford not to be there.”German publication Manager Magazin reported earlier on Thursday that VW was considering another bid for Proton, noting that its deliberations might even include a full-scale acquisition in the long term.VW spokesman Eric Felber declined to comment on the report.The German car maker, which surpassed Toyota last year to become the world's second-biggest manufacturer behind General Motors GM.N, has a goal of boosting global deliveries to more than 10 million vehicles by 2018.Six-month sales, including the group’s Audi and Skoda brands, rose 8.9 percent to 4.45 million vehicles, putting VW on track to beat last year’s record 8.3 million. Deliveries in the Asia-Pacific region surged 17.6 percent to 1.48 million cars, of which 1.3 million were sold in China, VW’s biggest market.Previous talks with VW foundered partly because of pressure from Malaysia’s former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who, as Proton adviser, said that the company (which was then state-owned) must remain in Malaysian hands. Malaysia’s state investment arm Khazanah sold its 42.7 percent stake in Proton in January to DRB-HICOM for $411.9 million.Underlining its push for world dominance, VW announced a major reshuffle of group and brand managers on June 2 to drive growth in emerging markets and accelerate a planned integration of its truck-making divisions.“It’s our clear goal to continue the successful (expansion)course of past years with great dynamics and stability,�� Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said on June 2.	8.704911487

* Toyota sold about 50,000 cars in China last month - exec* Sales recovered towards end of Sept, providing hope - exec* Japan brands�� woes lift other foreign brands�� sales* Hyundai Sept China sales up 15 pct to more than 84,000 vehicles* Toyota, Nissan shares weaker in Tokyo marketBy Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s China sales fell about 40 percent in September from the year before, while those of rivals such as Hyundai and BMW jumped, underscoring how badly Japanese brands have been hit by a territorial row between the two countries.Showroom traffic and sales have plunged at Japanese car makers since violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September over the Japanese government’s purchase of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea from their private owner.A prolonged sales hit of this scale could threaten profit forecasts at Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and others as China, the world’s biggest car market, makes up a bigger portion of their global sales.Toyota sold about 50,000 cars in China in September, a senior company executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Friday. That would be down from about 86,000 in September 2011 but better than the figure reported earlier by Japan’s Yomiuri newspaper, which said sales halved from the 75,000 sold in August.The dramatic fall-off in demand for Japanese vehicles has been an unexpected boon for other foreign brands, with South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co saying on Friday its China sales climbed 15 percent to 84,188 vehicles last month.Toyota declined to confirm the number, saying it would announce its Chinese sales for September on Tuesday.As demand evaporates, Toyota, Nissan, Honda Motor Co and others have been forced to cut back production in recent weeks in a slowing, but still promising Chinese market.A source told Reuters late last month that Toyota’s production cutbacks could extend through November, a move that would almost certainly put the company’s goal of selling 1 million cars in China this year out of reach.“I would say it’s almost impossible now,�� the executive said, blaming the wave of anti-Japan sentiment that has swept the country.He added, however, that sales showed signs of recovery towards the end of last month, especially over the final weekend, providing some hope for an early comeback.Anti-Japan sentiment across China escalated last month amid a row over a group of uninhabited islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China, whose nearby waters are thought to hold potentially rich natural gas reserves. They have been under Japan’s control since 1895.Demonstrators vandalised properties of Japanese companies, including a Toyota outlet in the eastern city of Qingdao that was torched, in the latest flare-up in tensions that have smouldered since the end of World War Two.Japanese car makers have been the most visible losers, although there have been signs of the tensions affecting other sectors, with All Nippon Airways Co Ltd (ANA) saying late last month it had seen a wave of cancellations on Japan-China routes.Semiconductor maker Rohm Co Ltd forecast a decline in orders for the second half of the fiscal year ending March, citing significant weakness from automakers.“The second half is not looking very good, it all depends on how much impact the events in China will have,�� said Hidemi Takasu, managing director of R&amp;D at Rohm, on the sidelines of the CEATEC technology trade show near Tokyo.“We sell quite a lot to automakers so when they decide to cut production we feel the impact.”On Thursday, Mazda Motor Corp said its China sales tumbled by more than a third last month from a year earlier, providing the first concrete numbers to point to Japanese automakers�� troubles in China.A Nissan executive said on Friday he expected the protests to have affected its Chinese sales in September, but reiterated the car maker’s stance that it would not alter its strategy there.“China is a growing market,�� Executive Vice President Takao Katagiri told reporters in Yokohama. He added that official figures would be announced after China’s mid-autumn festival holiday, which ends on Friday.The exodus from Japanese cars has in turn helped other foreign brands. Among premium brands, Volkswagen’s Audi boosted sales by 20 percent in September, BMW by 55 percent and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz by 10 percent.The owner of a large car dealership chain in China said his Japanese brand outlets - Toyota, Lexus, Nissan and Honda - have endured anti-Japan sentiment in the past.“But this time it feels a bit different, and I hope things will return to normal quickly as before,�� he said.Especially worrisome, he added, was the notion developing among some ordinary Chinese consumers, who were not necessarily anti-Japan, that it was risky to drive Japanese-brand cars.In some incidents last month, protesters attacked Japanese cars driving by, damaging them and in some cases beating up their drivers and passengers.Shares of Toyota and Nissan fell on Friday, against a modest gain in the broader Tokyo market.Nissan, whose exposure to China is the largest among Japan’s top three automakers at 27 percent of projected global sales, fell 1.5 percent. Toyota closed down 1.6 percent. The Topix index rose 0.2 percent.	4.697554698
(Corrects day in paragraph 1 to Thursday, not Friday)BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is in talks with Chinese automaker Geely about cooperation in gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle technology, but nothing had been decided on the matter.The Japanese automaker said in a statement to Reuters that it and Geely are currently “communicating with each other�� about gasoline-electric hybrid technology.“Toyota has been conducting the business with the open policy which also applies to the area of electrification technologies. The relationship with Geely (Toyota is exploring) is also based on this open policy,�� the statement said.Toyota’s response comes after a Chinese media report said Geely was working with Toyota on the conventional hybrid technology. The report said details on the joint effort would be announced soon. (Reporting By Norihiko Shirouzu)	2.028499581
* Carmaker committed to helping region rebuild* Popular Aqua hybrid raises hopes for area jobs* Strong yen, global rivals cloud outlook however* Aqua plant part of plan to widen production baseBy Chang-Ran KimKANEGASAKI, Japan, March 9 (Reuters) - At this 19-year-old Toyota factory in Kanegasaki, 500 km (300 miles) north of Tokyo, one shiny Aqua hybrid car rolls off the assembly line every 75 seconds, 17 hours a day.With 120,000 orders to fill from just the first month of sales since late December -- equivalent to 10 months�� worth of targeted sales in Japan -- the frantic pace will only quicken in the coming months.Toyota Motor Corp’s long-held plan of setting up a manufacturing base in Japan’s northeast coincides with the region’s efforts to rebuild itself up after being ravaged by the magnitude-9.0 earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis last March.The popularity of the Aqua and the business it could provide for ancillary parts makers could be a badly needed shot in the arm for the northeast, or Tohoku, territory.On top of the cost of rebuilding the devastated eastern coast, the frigid Tohoku region is home to an ailing electronics sector that has long been its cash cow. The strong yen and stiff global competition have caused huge losses on companies like TDK Corp and Renesas Electronics Corp, cranking up the pressure to close factories or shift work overseas, clouding the outlook for suppliers down the food chain.“If we lose our main source of income, it would be devastating for the local economy,�� said Keiji Sakuma, a director at the Tohoku Bureau of Economy, Trade and Industry. “In that sense, the auto industry could be our ray of hope.”Tohoku has attracted a long string of investments from Toyota, Japan’s top automaker, in the last few years.To diffuse the risk of a massive earthquake hitting its core manufacturing hub in central Japan, Toyota is on its way to establishing Tohoku as a third domestic production base, joining a second one on the southern island of Kyushu.In 2010, majority-owned subsidiary Prime Earth EV Energy built a factory in Miyagi prefecture to supply batteries for Toyota’s hybrids and plug-ins. Barely a month before the March 11 disasters, another subsidiary, Central Motor, opened a new assembly plant nearby to replace an ageing facility near Tokyo.Later this year, parts unit Toyota Motor Tohoku will open an engine factory, also in Miyagi, which accounted for more than half of the 16,000 deaths from the disasters last year.The Tohoku region will be in charge of developing and producing as many as 500,000 compact cars for Toyota a year. To maximise efficiency, Toyota will, in July, merge Central Motor, Toyota Motor Tohoku, and Kanto Auto Works, which operates the Aqua plant in Iwate prefecture, into a single company called Toyota Motor East Japan.“Thankfully, the Aqua has garnered tremendous support from customers,�� Kanto Auto Works president Tetsuo Hattori told reporters on Friday. “We hope that this car, produced here in Iwate, will serve as a bright spot for the recovery of Tohoku,�� he said ahead of a rare factory tour that was briefly interrupted by a moment of silence to mark one year since the disasters.With Toyota’s business growing in Tohoku, the region’s government expects an estimated 1,200 companies could get new or more work from the auto industry.Today, Tohoku’s contribution to Japan’s transport machinery sector is just 2.2 percent, compared with the 6 percent it contributes to the country’s gross domestic product and the 12-13 percent that electronic devices provide.“But once all the parts start moving in the auto sector, this (2.2 percent) figure should rise precipitously and that would spread to the electronic devices segment too,�� said the economy bureau’s Sakuma.Kanto Auto Works said its Iwate factory alone had hired an additional 200 contract workers to ramp up Aqua production to 30,000 a month for February and March, bringing total employment to around 2,500.Tohoku is also home to an engine factory of Nissan Motor Co . Japan’s No.2 automaker has said it would spend 3 billion yen ($37 million) to reinforce the plant, about 60 km from Fukushima’s crippled nuclear power plant, to guard against future earthquakes.While Toyota could prove a godsend for Tohoku, it won’t be smooth-sailing for the automaker. With the dollar trading around 81 yen, Toyota is struggling to make money on exports. Its huge global operations are cushioning the blow, but the disproportionate exposure to Japan has made a profit laggard out of Toyota.Toyota has committed to building 3 million of its 7.5 million vehicles a year in Japan, triple the volumes for both Nissan and Honda Motor Co. That is capping Toyota’s operating margin at an estimated 1.5 percent in the business year ending this month, far short of Nissan’s forecast of 5.4 percent and Hyundai Motor Co’s 10 percent last year.“When Toyota crafted this plan for Tohoku, the dollar was probably worth 120 yen, making Japan a low-cost country,�� Goldman Sachs auto analyst Kota Yuzawa said. “Now, Japan is a very high-cost country and Toyota’s got to work much harder.”Kanto Auto’s Hattori said even for his lean Iwate plant, 81 yen was tough for exports. The Iwate plant so far ships overseas one in every five Aquas it produces. The factory’s total exports have halved to 30 percent from pre-financial crisis levels, he said.Toyota’s executive vice president, Shinichi Sasaki, who oversees purchasing, is counting on Tohoku’s lower land prices and wages as well as government incentives for new business initiatives, to help it compete. Toyota hopes to double the amount of parts it buys in the region to 80 percent as soon as possible to lower delivery costs, he told reporters last week.In Iwate, Toyota’s ideas for saving money go beyond the factory floor. A few years ago, workers came up with the idea of employing goats to feed on the patches of green on site instead of using manpower and fuel to whack the weeds. During the winter, 1,500 tonnes of snow is stored to provide cool air during the summer rather than running the air-conditioning.For the factory, the pressure will rise after the initial excitement for the Aqua - the world’s cheapest and most fuel-efficient hybrid to date - runs its course.The car’s popularity in Japan is partly driven by government subsidies to replace older cars with hybrids and other fuel-sipping cars. That budget could run out in about half a year.“The real test will come in October,�� Goldman Sachs�� Yuzawa said. “At that point, when demand in Japan pulls back, we’ll see how well the car does in the United States. And if these exchange rates stick, it’s going to be painful.”The Aqua will go on sale as the Prius c in the United States in the coming months. It will also be sold in about 50 other countries, mostly in Asia.Economic sense or not, auto executives say the car industry, as a rare remaining bright spot in corporate Japan, has an obligation to do its part for the country, particularly when the prospects appear so bleak after the triple disasters.“If we upped and left, who would protect these jobs? Who will pay the taxes? Who will help with Japan’s recovery?�� Nissan’s chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga, who also heads Japan’s auto industry lobby, told Reuters last week.“We have no one to pass the baton to. If we as corporate citizens of Japan stopped caring, this country would be in a dire state.��	-1.304662962
* First Sonata revamp in over four years* New Genesis sedan planned in late 2013 -CEO* Hyundai shares down 0.9 pct vs 0.6 pct fall in KOSPISEOUL, March 21 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor plans to launch a revamped version of its flagship Sonata sedan in 2014, its first upgrade in more than four years, its chief executive said on Wednesday, as the company grapples with increasing foreign competition in its home market.Hyundai, the world’s fifth-largest auto group along with its affiliate Kia Motors, has only one new model planned for a global launch this year. It started taking pre-orders on Wednesday for the new Santa Fe sports utility vehicle, which will be unveiled in April.The latest version of the Sonata was launched in September 2009 in South Korea and early 2010 in the United States.Sonata, which competes with Toyota Motor Corp’s Camry, is Hyundai’s top-selling model in the United States and helped the South Korean automaker achieve record sales and market share there last year. It was Hyundai’s third-best selling model in South Korea last year.Hyundai’s domestic car sales are increasingly coming under pressure following free trade deals with Europe and the United States that have boosted international automakers�� access to South Korea’s formerly sheltered market.Sales of imported cars topped 10 percent of the market for the first time in January this year, according to industry data.Toyota has started to sell U.S.-made Camry sedans in South Korea and is considering importing cars from Europe as it seeks to boost local sales by 160 percent to 13,000 vehicles this year, and Lexus sales by 90 percent to 8,000.Hyundai chief executive Kim Choong-ho also told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry meeting that the revamped version of the large-sized Genesis would be introduced in late 2013.Shares in Hyundai fell 0.9 percent by 0310 GMT, versus a 0.6 percent rise in the broader market.	-4.073368271
* India autos will no longer see uninterrupted move upwards-Suzuki* Global players re-evaluating strategy, focus on strengths* Taxes, regulatory changes plaguing global car makers in IndiaNEW DELHI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp said it was no longer gung-ho about India’s auto market, the world’s fourth-largest, where it has seen relentless growth in the past seven years. And the parent of the country’s biggest car maker is not alone.The Japanese automaker issued the warning after it reported a slump in quarterly profit this week on tumbling sales at its Indian unit, Maruti Suzuki, which accounts for half the number of cars sold in India.“We no longer think that growth in India will be an uninterrupted move upwards,�� Suzuki President Toshihiro Suzuki cautioned. Maruti’s sales, which were growing till January, has slipped every month over February-September 2019.India’s auto sector has gone into a tailspin this year as tight liquidity at shadow banks, high taxes and a weak rural economy have sapped consumers�� buying power.Global players like Ford, Volkswagen and Fiat are already re-evaluating their strategy as they struggle to make inroads in a market dominated by small cars.“Car makers are getting very cautious regarding their future investments in India. Most of them are either deferring or just scrapping their India new model plans,�� said Puneet Gupta, an autos sector expert at IHS Markit.Auto executives and analysts point out that some car makers are focusing on their strengths in terms of products instead of chasing volumes with small cars. Some others are taking drastic steps to reduce their exposure.Ford has agreed to sell a majority stake in its India arm to Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, ending its independent operations in the country after two decades and highlighting the challenges automakers face in growing profitably in Asia’s third-largest economy.A cocktail of higher taxes under a new goods and services tax regime, flip-flop over electric-vehicle policy, and a boom of ride-sharing firms such as Uber and Ola have all plagued global automakers in India. Not having the right cars and smaller sales network have also hurt, some executives say.“When you have policy instability it becomes very hard to convince headquarters to invest more in the country,�� an executive at a western automaker said.India is largely a small-car market and that is not a strength for most global automakers, who sell more SUVs and luxury cars elsewhere such as in China and the United States - the world’s top two car markets, the executive added.Western automakers had to design products specifically for India which is an expensive exercise, said V.G. Ramakrishnan, managing partner at consultancy Avanteum Advisors.“Many chose a mass-market strategy instead of a niche one,�� and are dialling back to focus on specific segments, he said.Volkswagen has put its sister company Skoda in charge of India strategy and will focus on SUVs. Fiat too has put SUV-maker Jeep in charge of driving sales in the country.Demand for SUVs in India is growing faster than some small car segments, prompting even the likes of Maruti that dominates the small-car space to look at launching SUVs and crossovers.Honda is re-evaluating its India plans and may convert one of its two plants into a research centre, local media reported.Toyota and Suzuki have formed an alliance to share supply chain costs and develop new vehicle technologies together.“Automakers want to exploit their existing resources, minimize their costs and maximize their returns,�� Gupta said.

July 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. senator told federal safety regulators he is concerned that they didn’t go far enough in a probe that found Toyota Motor Corp’s electronics systems did not cause unintended acceleration incidents.Sen. Charles Grassley, Republican from Iowa, sent a letter, dated Thursday, to the regulators saying a phenomenon known as tin whiskers “may be a cause for concern.”In a statement, Toyota said, “No one has ever found a single real-world example of tin whiskers causing an unintended acceleration event.”Grassley’s letter said tin whiskers are “electronically conductive, crystalline structures of tin that sometimes grow from surfaces where tin (especially electroplated tin) is used as a final finish.”Company spokesman Brian Lyons said, “There have been a lot of theories that tin whiskers can cause unintended acceleration. The fact is, they never have.”The NHTSA said on Friday it would carefully review Grassley’s letter and respond appropriately.A NASA report issued in February 2011 as well as findings of an independent scientific panel in January 2012 support Toyota’s stance that its throttle systems were not the cause of the unintended acceleration events that prompted the worst safety crisis in the history of Japan’s leading automaker.About 8 million Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles were recalled in the United States in 2009 and 2010, which along with Japan is Toyota’s largest market. Toyota is No. 3 in U.S. sales so far this year.Millions of other Toyota and Lexus vehicles were recalled worldwide. The recalls were not for the electronic throttle systems. Many of them were for floormats that could cause accelerator pedals to become stuck open.Grassley’s letter cites the NASA report as cautioning that even though NASA found no proof that the electronic throttle control system caused the reported unintended acceleration events, that does not mean they could not occur.Toyota said that there is no data that suggests that its vehicles are any more prone to “tin whiskers�� issues than those of other manufacturers.“In the unlikely event that tin whiskers cause a short- circuit in the pedal position sensor,�� Toyota’s statement said, “our systems detect the fault, illuminate the malfunction indicator light and put the vehicle into “limp home�� mode, allowing the driver to safely move the vehicle to the side of the road as designed.NHTSA and NASA reports on unintended acceleration can be found at www.nhtsa.gov/ua.	6.24426079

Jones ends bad luck with first win this yearBy Rob GrayNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeNEWTON, Iowa -- Last season, a powerful run through Iowa Speedway helped Erik Jones emerge from the tall shadows cast by bad luck.But his escape from misfortune proved short lived -- until, again, Iowa.Jones entered Friday night’s American Ethanol 200 winless in eight 2015 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series starts and stung by back-to-back finishes of 23rd and 15th.He left the track pumping his fists after a victory.The talented 19-year-old driver led 112 laps and dominated most of the race en route to his fifth career series victory.“We’ve had fast trucks,�� Jones said. “Things just haven’t been happening. Just kept fighting the good fight and waited for it to come around.”Jones finished 5.661 seconds ahead of runner-up Brandon Jones.Tyler Reddick took third, Matt Crafton was fourth and Christopher Bell -- in his first career start -- completed the top five. Crafton retained his points lead by 12 over Reddick. Jones stands third, 26 points behind Crafton.“I think we’ve had speed all year long, honestly,�� said Brandon Jones, whose teammate, Spencer Gallagher, secured a career-high second last weekend at Gateway Motorsports Park. “It’s just starting to come around for us.”Bell started 10th and the former USAC national midget champion hadn’t raced on pavement until eptember.“I just had one expectation and goal and that was just to finish the race,�� Bell said. “I really didn’t know what to expect, so to come out with a top five, I’m just thrilled about it.”A different type of excitement pulsed through Jones, who earlier Friday became the series�� youngest pole winner at Iowa at 19 years, 20 days.He led the first 43 laps and slipped back to ninth after a lap 53 restart but patiently threaded to third by lap 98.Jones retook the lead for good on lap 128, surging by Crafton on another restart and within 15 laps had built a 1.5-second advantage.Crafton led 33 laps. Teammates Johnny Sauter and Cameron Hayley led 14 and 37 laps, respectively, before mechanical issues took them off the pace.Jones finally evaded a similar setback.“This one’s just enjoyment now,�� Jones said. “We’re back in the swing of things. I guess the last month was just stressful all around. Stressful on me as a person. ... I kind of came to realize it doesn’t come as easy as everybody thinks it does. I had a lot of success early on and definitely got into kind of a hard spot.”Make that hard spots.His win last season at Iowa’s fast, short track ignited a much-needed hot streak that followed a 23rd-place finish at Gateway.Deja vu?“It’s really similar,�� Jones said. “Last year, we really kind of came off the same beginning to the season to this point and went here and kind of turned everything around.“So I would say our luck or whatever you want to call it was worse this year at the beginning of the year than it was last year but definitely a similar feel in getting back to Victory Lane here and getting things going in the right direction.”It worked last year.Jones closed out the 2014 Camping World Trucks season with two more wins and posted at least a top-seven finish in seven of the final eight races.And while it’s doubtful 2015 will fully mirror 2014, Jones offered a confident prediction.“It took us awhile to get here, but now that we’re here, I think we’ll keep reeling a few off,�� he said.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race - American Ethanol 200Iowa SpeedwayNewton, IowaFriday, June 19, 20151.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Monday they hope to restart U.S. and Canadian auto production in May amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.The Japanese automaker halted production on March 23 and said it will extend the halt through May 1.Fiat Chrysler said Monday it “intends to progressively restart its U.S. and Canadian manufacturing facilities beginning May 4.”U.S. President Donald Trump last week extended the guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus to April 30.Several U.S. auto industry executives told Reuters on Monday it will be nearly impossible for companies to resume production before the end of the month -- and there is no assurance automakers will be able to resume production in early May. Other automakers plan to extend current production halts later this week, automakers told Reuters.It will also take auto suppliers time to resume production. In an internal estimate, Ford Motor Co F.N said last week it believed 600,000 U.S. industry auto sales may have been lost in March because of the coronavirus outbreak.Honda noted many consumers are unable to purchase vehicles and said it “must continue to suspend production in order to align product supply with a lack of market demand.�� Some states have barred car dealers from selling new cars while “stay at home�� order are in place.Last week, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said it would extend its U.S. production halt into late April. Toyota Motor Corp has halted U.S. and Canadian production through April 17 7203.T.Ford said last week it was postponing its plan to restart production at its North America. Ford had been aiming to resume production at several key U.S. plants on April 14, but then said it would now do so at dates to be announced later. Ford said Monday it is “continuing to assess public health conditions, government guidelines and supplier readiness to determine when the time is right to resume production in our North American plants.”General Motors Co GM.N has shuttered its plants indefinitely and has not provided a date for vehicle production to restart. Automakers are working on additional employee protections to add when they restart, including new personal protective gear, staggering shift starts, more frequent cleanings and new social distancing rules.Fiat Chrysler said it will redesign “work stations to maintain proper social distancing and expanding the already extensive cleaning protocols at all locations.��	-0.311730927
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T is on track for its best annual profit in five years and a rosier longer-term future, boosted by the popularity of the new Fit subcompact which left the company struggling to keep up with demand.Japan’s third-largest automaker kept its operating profit target for the year to next March unchanged at 780 billion yen ($7.95 billion), up 43 percent from the year before, boosted by a weaker yen and strong sales in the United States, its biggest market.The maker of the Civic compact and Accord sedan said demand for the Fit, which is being positioned as a top-selling model worldwide and made its global sales debut in Japan in September, was stronger than expected and backlogs had emerged.“We are doing our best to speed up the Fit delivery dates but there is a limit to what the suppliers can supply and the capacity of our plants,�� Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told an earnings briefing.The Fit is essential to the company’s ambitious sales target of 6 million vehicles by end-March 2017, compared with a record 4.01 million in the last financial year, and it required heavy spending to expand or build new plants.For the July-September quarter, Honda posted an operating profit of $1.75 billion, or 171.4 billion yen, up from 100.8 billion yen a year ago. The result compared with the average estimate of 180.8 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of six analysts.Foreign exchange moves, largely the yen’s weakening against the dollar, boosted quarterly operating profit by 93.6 billion yen, although marketing costs and a rise in depreciation ate into that gain.The Japanese currency has weakened to around 98 yen against the dollar from 79 yen about year ago, boosting profits both from its export business and from the conversion of money made overseas back into the yen.Honda posted 13.1 percent sales growth in the United States, where it is the fifth biggest carmaker, helped by strong sales of the Accord and Civic.Globally, Honda kept its car sales forecast for the 2013/14 financial year at 4.43 million vehicles.Higher-than-expected demand for the Fit caught Honda’s parts suppliers by surprise. Honda has received 82,000 orders for the subcompact in a little over a month and the company has back orders for more than 60,000 vehicles, Iwamura said.Honda will begin operating a new plant in Mexico in the spring of 2014 to manufacture the Fit, with U.S. sales due to start around the same time.Iwamura said a region of concern for Honda was Thailand, where sales have slowed after an incentive program for first-car buyers ended.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T also saw sales drop in Thailand, Southeast Asia's largest auto market, by more than one-fourth in the last quarter.Honda is the first of Japan’s big three automakers to announce quarterly results. Nissan, Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, said on Wednesday that it is moving its earnings date to November 1 from November 5, while market leader Toyota will announce on November 6.($1 = 98.0900 Japanese yen)	-4.110647504
* Car sales down after 20 months of y-o-y growth* Last-year record results hard to match - research firm SamarWARSAW, March 4 (Reuters) - Polish new car sales fell year-on-year in February for the first time in nearly two years, an industry monitor said on Wednesday, with car dealers struggling to match record sales in the same month a year ago, which were boosted by a one-off tax relief.Passenger car and small truck sales fell 10.0 percent in February compared with the same month last year, research institute Samar said.In monthly terms, sales fell by 1.8 percent in February, following a 5.5 percent drop in January.The top-selling car makers in Poland are Volkswagen and its subsidiary Skoda, along with Toyota, General Motors�� Opel and Ford.

TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday said it would expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards.The announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making “greener�� cars as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years.In addition to improving the efficiency of its hybrid systems and gasoline engines, Toyota is stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars in a shift from its strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles.Toyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform.By 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the U.S., Europe and China will feature new powertrain components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said.Toyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars.Toyota has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050.To this end, Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota’s powertrain division, told reporters at a strategy briefing that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota’s global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.While Toyota invests heavily in alternatives to conventional engines, it believes gasoline engines and hybrid systems will play a large role in the medium term as it will take “quite some time�� for electric cars to become a common sight on roads and highways around the world, given their limited driving range and charging infrastructure.

* Topix hits 2-year highs* Toyota rises 2 pct after raising earnings outlook* Kajima soars after its April-June profit jumps* Toshiba soars after report auditor to sign off on resultsBy Ayai TomisawaTOKYO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Monday, led by sharp gains for Toyota Motor Corp after it raised its earnings outlook, while a weaker yen following strong U.S. jobs data underpinned overall sentiment.Toyota surged 2.0 percent after the world’s No.2 automaker raised its full-year outlook on Friday thanks to favourable exchange rates.Another winner was construction company Kajima Corp , jumping 5.3 percent to a near 21-year high after the company reported a 65.6 percent jump in its April-June net profit.The Nikkei ended 0.5 percent higher to 20,055.89. The broader Topix gained 0.5 percent to 1,639.27, the highest closing level since August 2015, though overall trade was thin, with only 1.5 billion shares changing hands on the main board, the lowest level in two weeks.“Carmakers had conservative earnings outlooks in the beginning of this fiscal year, so the fact that Toyota raised its forecast is boosting sentiment,�� said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. “The market has been happy with quarterly Japanese corporate earnings so far, and positive sentiment will likely last this week.”The dollar, which briefly sank below 110.00 yen to a seven-week low last week, finally pulled ahead after stronger-than-expected jobs growth in July.On Friday, the closely watched U.S. jobs data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by a better-than-expected 209,000 jobs last month, and June’s employment gain was revised higher.In Asian trade, the dollar was up 0.1 percent at 110.785 yen after rising as high as 111.050 on Friday.Another big mover was Toshiba Corp, which soared more than 5.9 percent after the Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun newspaper reported on Monday that Toshiba’s auditors will sign off on its financial results for the year ended March.Toshiba’s auditor, Pricewaterhouse Coopers Aarata, is expected to issue a so-called “unqualified opinion�� approving the firm’s accounts or a “qualified opinion�� indicating some minor problems with the books, to meet a Thursday deadline imposed by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

TOKYO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Denso Corp, the world’s second largest supplier of automotive parts, raised its annual operating profit forecast by 5.6 percent, slightly below expectations, as a weaker yen helped boost exports, resulting in foreign exchange gains.Denso forecast a 380 billion yen ($3.73 billion) annual operating profit for the year ending March, up 44.8 percent from a year ago but lower than the average estimate of 384.7 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 17 analysts.Denso’s nine-month operating profit rose 54.2 percent year-on-year to 289.9 billion yen after it saw an increase in car production in North America.Denso is 22.3 percent owned by Toyota Motor Corp, which is also a major client. It also supplies parts to Honda Motor Co Ltd and General Motors Co as well as other big global automakers.Denso shares were down as much as 2 percent after the numbers were released, hitting a six-week low of 5,230 yen.The shares have risen by more than 75 percent since the beginning of last year, outpacing a 42 percent rise in Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei average.	0.4523281596
PARIS, April 12 (Reuters) - French companies in the automotive, aerospace and steel sectors are ready to return to work and assure “impeccable, sanitary conditions��, the country’s metals lobby on Sunday, and called on the government to spell out the country’s plans.President Emmanuel Macron is scheduled to address the nation regarding the new coronavirus situation on Monday evening.He is expected to extend a national lockdown put in place to contain the spread of the new coronavirus for a second time, beyond April 15.Industry is in a “an extremely worrying situation�� after 24 days of lockdown, Philippe Darmayan, president of the union of metals industry and businesses (UIMM), said in an interview with newspaper Le Parisien.The UIMM represents 42,000 companies in the automotive, steel and aeronautics sectors.“It cannot last very long. Otherwise, we will find ourselves tomorrow facing a series of bankruptcies,�� said Darmayan, who is also president of ArcelorMittal France.“Today we know how to run our workshops safely and we are ready for a restart in perfect sanitary conditions,�� he said.Darmayan added that many companies have decided on measures to protect employees, such as wearing masks, separating workspaces, and cutting back to six from eight working hours to allow for decontaminating workspaces between shifts.“We will need a recovery plan...so that we can see clearly. It must be built quickly. Let us not add an economic and social drama to the health catastrophe.“I expect the president to tell us: ��you are essential to the nation��; ‘I have understood that you are able to organise yourself in the face of the crisis��,�� Darmayan said.Toyota on Friday presented French unions with a plan to gradually resume production at its factory in Onnaing, in the north of France, from April 21, a spokesman for the Japanese automaker told Reuters.The factory, which assembles the Toyota Yaris, has been shut down since mid-March. Two out of three teams are scheduled to return to work.The CGT union voted against the plan on Friday. Other unions will vote following a health and safety evaluation of the measures proposed by management due on Tuesday.	-2.886359888

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)Sept 28 -===============================================================================Summary analysis -- Toyota Motor Corp. ---------------------------- 28-Sep-2012===============================================================================CREDIT RATING: AA-/Negative/A-1+ Country: JapanPrimary SIC: Motor Vehiclesand EquipmentMult. CUSIP6: 892331===============================================================================Credit Rating History:Local currency Foreign currency04-Mar-2011 AA-/A-1+ AA-/A-1+08-May-2009 AA/A-1+ AA/A-1+06-Feb-2009 AA+/A-1+ AA+/A-1+===============================================================================RationaleThe ratings on Japan-based Toyota Motor Corp. (AA-/Negative/A-1+) reflect its strong market position, with extensive geographic and product diversity; minimal financial risk profile; technological leadership; and close relationships with highly competitive and financially strong Toyota group suppliers. Partially offsetting these strengths are weak profitability--due to record highs for the yen--and intense competition in the global auto industry.Toyota Motor faced another challenging year in fiscal 2011 (ended March 31, 2012) affected by supply disruptions and production cuts following the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. However, the company posted worldwide sales of 7.35 million units, driven by a strong rebound in the second half of the year as production and inventory levels recovered. Inventory levels returned to normal by the end of March 2012, and the recovery in sales has accelerated in fiscal 2012. Revenues of nonfinancial services during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 rebounded sharply by 65% from same period a year earlier, supported by strong unit sales growth across regions. In our opinion, Toyota Motor’s competitive position remains strong, and we expect the company to regain some of its lost market share in the U.S. and other key markets.We expect Toyota Motor’s profitability to improve from weak levels in fiscal 2011 because operations have been stabilizing. Further, the company’s proven ability to consistently reduce costs should help it improve profitability. In recent years, Toyota Motor has consistently cut about JPY300 billion in costs annually. Moreover, it is taking extra measures to reduce exposure to the strong yen, such as increasing local content in vehicles produced overseas and increasing its imports of components for vehicles produced in Japan. In our base case scenario, we expect Toyota Motor’s nonfinancial services operations to achieve an operating margin of about 5% and an EBITDA margin of about 10% by fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, we see overproduction in Japan, with many vehicles destined for overseas markets, as a weakness that could prevent Toyota Motor from making the continuous improvements in profitability that we expect, in the event that the yen becomes even stronger.We view Toyota Motor’s financial risk profile to be minimal because of the company’s very strong capital structure and exceptional liquidity. We expect the company’s nonfinancial services operations to generate significant positive free operating cash flow in fiscal 2012 with stabilizing operations leading to strong cash flow generation and moderate capital expenditure. Despite difficult business conditions and the strong yen, we expect credit metrics to remain very strong over the next two years, with a ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt of significantly over 100% and a ratio of debt to EBITDA of under 1.0x on a fully adjusted basis. Toyota Motor has accumulated historically high levels of surplus cash over the past two years and its nonfinancial services operations are virtually debt free with a net cash position. We believe Toyota Motor’s very strong capital structure and exceptional liquidity should help it maintain its minimal financial risk profile in the future.LiquidityExceptional liquidity underpins the ‘AA-�� long-term rating on Toyota Motor. We believe that the company’s sources of liquidity will easily exceed 2x uses over the next two years. As of June 30, 2012, on a consolidated basis, Toyota Motor’s cash and cash equivalents totaled JPY1.8 trillion. Moreover, Toyota Motor holds large investments in highly rated government securities, such as Japanese government bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds, and it classifies these as both current assets and investments. We view these as high-quality financial assets that further support Toyota Motor’s exceptional liquidity. Toyota Motor’s total cash and securities significantly exceeded the JPY2.3 trillion in long-term debt that was due to mature within a year on a consolidated basis. We believe Toyota Motor maintains a massive net cash position in its nonfinancial services operations. In addition, the company had JPY7.6 trillion in long-term unused lines of credit as of March 31, 2012, and it maintains strong relationships with major Japanese banking groups. Toyota Motor’s captive finance operations�� short-term assets adequately match its short-term debts.OutlookThe negative outlook reflects Standard &amp; Poor’s view that Toyota Motor’s overproduction in Japan has the potential to delay a recovery in its earnings. Although we expect Toyota Motor to gradually become less vulnerable to a strong yen by increasing local content in vehicles produced overseas and increasing imports of components for vehicles produced in Japan, large production capacity in Japan may slow the pace of recovery if the yen rises further.We may lower the ratings if we conclude that Toyota Motor’s nonfinancial services operations are unlikely to continue to demonstrate improvement and achieve an operating margin of about 5% and an EBITDA margin of about 10% on a sustainable basis.At the same time, we may revise the outlook back to stable if we believe the company is likely to significantly accelerate the recovery in its profitability through effective measures to increase its resilience to the strong yen or rapidly expand sales in major vehicle markets. However, the challenges the company faces, including intense competition and the strong yen, lead us to view an upward outlook revision as less likely in the next 12 months.	0.5190086934
TOKYO (Reuters) - Three foreign funds on Monday said they would oppose Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T proposal to issue a new class of shares, joining an influential California pension fund in objecting to a sale that critics say favors Japanese retail investors.Toyota aims to sell “Model AA�� shares, named after its first passenger car, to attract long-term investors. Unlike common shares, they are unlisted and will be sold only in Japan, meaning foreign investors will have to buy them through intermediaries.The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Florida State Board of Administration, and Ontario Teachers�� Pension Plan will vote against the plan at Toyota’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, the U.S. Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds and endowments, said in a newsletter.Toyota said it could not immediately comment.The automaker has registered to issue up to 50 million Model AA shares for as much as 500 billion yen ($4.05 billion), earmarking the funds raised for long-term product development.The shares must be held for five years after which holders can convert them into common stock or have Toyota buy them back at their issue price.The latest opposition comes a week after the California State Teachers�� Retirement System, the second-largest U.S. public pension fund, said it would vote against the plan because the sale would essentially be closed to foreign investors.It also comes as a new corporate governance code takes effect in Japan, encouraging investors to voice concerns and forcing companies to consider the views of those who vote against management-backed proposals.Toyota needs a two-thirds majority at its annual general meeting to pass the plan.But the vote would likely be close because around 30 percent of Toyota shares are held by foreign investors, finance industry executives told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media on the matter.	-0.2131412612
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has given the Corolla, one of the world's best-selling cars, a major makeover and launched it in Japan on Tuesday in hopes that a sporty silhouette and new interactive functions will draw in younger buyers. While ubiquitous among first-time drivers and university students in North America, Corolla’s top market that accounts for about a third of its global sales, the model has become known as a car for the elderly at home where the average age of its owners is around 70 - an image Toyota wants to change.“We’re grateful that our older customers have remained loyal to the Corolla,�� said Yoshiki Konishi, chief engineer of the Corolla Sport, the newest model which next goes on sale in North America in the coming months and Europe in 2019.“But we want the Corolla to resonate more with younger drivers ... we want to target people in their 20s and 30s.”To spruce up the image of its most iconic model, Toyota has led the Corolla’s rollout with the hatchback Sport version rather than the traditional sedan.For Japan, the Corolla Sport comes fitted with Toyota’s data communication module which collects driving data to provide cloud-based, real-time navigation and technical support, while also monitoring vehicle health to give maintenance updates.Corolla and a revamped domestic Crown sedan model, also launched on Tuesday, will be Toyota’s first mass-market cars to offer such advanced technological functions that were previously available exclusively in models from its high-end Lexus brand. Other automakers offer similar functions.“By adding connected capabilities to a model known for being popular among older drivers, Toyota is trying to attract younger people to the Corolla, and widen its customer base (at home), said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama.“By doing so, it is betting that the next car trend may not be based on vehicle segment or model, but perhaps on applications, or functions.”But attracting younger drivers is tough in general in fast-graying Japan, where the number of driving license holders aged under 30 dropped 22 percent in the past decade while for those aged 65 and above it jumped 64 percent, official data shows.The Corolla Sport’s revamped image and connected functions had limited appeal for Yuhei Fujita, a 27-year-old who works for a tech company in Tokyo and does not own a car.“Most cars have decent navigation systems, and if I were to buy a car I’d be happy to be able to connect my smartphone to it,�� Fujita said.“The Corolla has a strong image as being a family car, so I’m not sure why Toyota wants to market it toward younger people now.”Toyota declined to give demographic targets for the newest member of the Corolla family, which has sold 46 million units across more than 150 countries since its launch in 1966.But Konishi acknowledged the reliability of the Corolla would likely continue to draw in mature drivers.“I’m in my 50s, and I’m planning to buy one.��	5.782393203
TOKYO (Reuters) - As many automakers struggle with slowing demand in the U.S. car market, one of Japan’s smaller automakers has managed to buck the trend by sticking to an unconventional marketing strategy, along with a little “love��.Subaru Corp 7270.T, Japan's No. 6 automaker by global sales volume, posted on Thursday a 17.5 percent rise in its quarterly operating profit to 119.3 billion yen ($1.08 billion), buoyed by higher sales in the United States, its biggest market.With worldwide sales roughly one-tenth that of compatriot Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T, Subaru reported a 12.3 percent jump in U.S. sales for the quarter, even as many of its rivals have been hit by both an overall slowdown in the U.S. market from record levels last year and a growing preference for bigger vehicle models, versus the sedan. Subaru's sales gains contrasted with the 5.7 percent drop in North American sales at Japan's No.3 automaker Honda Motor 7267.T and a 6.0 percent fall at Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T.Like most Japanese automakers, Subaru sells more sedans than trucks and SUVs in the United States, but even as sales have dwindled for smaller models, its outperformance in the world’s No. 2 auto market after China was driven largely by strong demand for the recently revamped version of its Impreza sedan.The new model is more fuel efficient than its predecessor and carries more advanced safety features. But with it and its other models like the Outback and the Forester, Subaru has departed from selling cars as high-performance machines, marketing them instead as lifestyle products.Its marketing strategy in the United States, which accounts for around 60 percent of its global sales volume, for years has focused mainly on affluent and liberal-minded consumers, with advertisements featuring slogans such as love and inclusion which have won over consumers living largely on the west and east coasts.“We use ‘love�� as a keyword in our marketing. In the past we focused on selling cars based on their performance, but for years we’ve been promoting our cars as something which will make our customers�� lives more fulfilling,�� CFO Toshiaki Okada told reporters at a results briefing.This strategy has worked for the tiny automaker - monthly sales in the United States have climbed on a year-on-year basis for 68 straight months.Along with a boost in U.S. production capacity last year, Okada said this strategy would “help our numbers going forward��, while cautioning that U.S. selling incentives would increase this year as competition remains fierce.Subaru produces just over 1 million vehicles annually at its plants in Japan and the United States, compared with Toyota’s roughly 10 million at plants across all major continents.Toyota is expected to announce a 16 percent drop in its quarterly operating profit, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, while Nissan 7201.T last week posted an almost 13 percent slide in profit, dragged by rising incentives to sell its cars in the United States.Meanwhile, Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T, which does not sell cars in the United States, posted on Thursday a 44 percent jump in its first-quarter operating profit, boosted by a 14.3 percent rise in vehicles sales in its biggest market, India.	0.7894970283
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge granted preliminary approval on Friday to Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T $1.1 billion settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by consumers who lost value on their cars due to sudden, unintended acceleration.U.S. District Judge James Selna in Santa Ana, California, scheduled a hearing in June for final approval of the deal, which was announced this week. It provides $500 million in cash for plaintiffs, plus installation of break override systems and a customer support program valued at about $600 million combined.“Settlement will likely serve the interests of the class members better than litigation,�� Selna wrote.Plaintiff lawyer Steve Berman said he was pleased with the favorable comments in Selna’s order. Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said the company was gratified by Selna’s approval of the settlement, “which will provide value to our customers and provides an extra measure of confidence in their vehicles.”About 16 million Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles sold in the United States spanning the model years 1998 to 2010 are covered by the settlement. Company officials have maintained that the electronic throttle control system was not at fault, instead blaming ill-fitting floor mats and sticky gas pedals.A study by federal safety officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and NASA found no link between reports of unintended acceleration and Toyota’s electronic throttle control system.Toyota, the No. 3 automaker in the U.S. market, admitted no fault in proposing the settlement, one of the largest U.S. mass class-action litigations in the automotive sector. One plaintiff’s law firm called it the largest settlement in U.S. history involving auto defects.However, the deal does not cover wrongful death or injury lawsuits, believed to total more than 300 according to a Toyota filing in June.Toyota’s recall of its vehicles between 2009 and 2011 relating to the unintended acceleration issue hurt its reputation for reliability and safety.But the automaker’s sales were up almost 29 percent in 2012 through November, compared with a 14 percent increase in the industry, and Toyota’s share of the U.S. market has risen to 14.4 percent from 12.7 percent in 2011.In his order on Friday, Selna said the settlement is fair, given the risks of further litigation and the complicated legal rulings he has issued throughout the case.“Some of these rulings have been favorable to plaintiffs, some have been favorable to Toyota,�� Selna wrote. “Were the parties to proceed to a fully litigated result, virtually any outcome would face the risk of uncertainty upon appellate review of these rulings.”Selna also approved up to $200 million in attorneys�� fees, saying the amount falls within 25 percent of the total settlement which is the benchmark established by appellate law.The case is In re: Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 10-ml-02151.	1.64075067
TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it aims to boost worldwide sales of its Lexus luxury cars by about a quarter to 500,000-510,000 vehicles this year, bringing them back to levels before the global financial crisis hammered demand.Lexus lost its crown as the top luxury brand in the United States for the first time in 12 years in 2011, ceding the spot to BMW AG as Toyota suffered lost production after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.But Toyota’s 23-year-old premium marque has also struggled because of its weak image in Europe and Japan, where German giants BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi dominate.To change that, Lexus has adopted a new look to give all future models a front grille in the shape of a spindle, including the remodelled GS sedan launched in Japan on Thursday.“Our competitors -- Mercedes, BMW and Audi -- are all instantly recognisable on the road,�� Kiyotaka Ise, chief officer of the Lexus group, told reporters at the GS’s unveiling in Tokyo. “That’s what we’re going for.”The Lexus target comes after Toyota lifted its 2012 overall domestic sales forecast on Wednesday to 1.63 million vehicles, up 6.5 percent from its previous forecast and 36 percent higher than 2011. It now expects global sales to rise 21 percent to 8.58 million vehicles.In the luxury car market, competition for the Lexus is set to intensify with Nissan Motor Co’s Infiniti and Honda Motor Co’s Acura also the subject of stepping up efforts to become global brands.Ise’s deputy, Kazuo Ohara, said Lexus would step up marketing activities to raise its profile as a technologically advanced nameplate in Japan, where consumers largely equate luxury and status with traditional European brands.The GS sedan will start at 5.1 million yen ($65,200) in Japan for the 2.5-litre, rear-wheel-drive version, while the top-of-the-line GS450h hybrid version will start at 7.0 million yen. Toyota has set a monthly sales target of 600 GS sedans in Japan.Ohara said he expected overall Lexus sales in Japan to be only slightly higher than last year’s 42,365 vehicles.BMW sold 34,195 vehicles in Japan in 2011, while Mercedes sold 33,207 and Audi 21,166.Globally, Lexus sold 404,000 vehicles last year, down from a peak of 518,000 in 2007.	13.63327443
(Reuters) - Elon Musk is hailed as an innovator and disruptor who went from knowing next to nothing about building cars to running the world’s most valuable automaker in the space of 16 years.But his record shows he is more of a fast learner who forged alliances with firms that had technology Tesla lacked, hired some of their most talented people, and then powered through the boundaries that limited more risk-averse partners.Now, Musk and his team are preparing to outline new steps in Tesla’s drive to become a more self-sufficient company less reliant on suppliers at its “Battery Day�� event on Sept. 22.Musk has been dropping hints for months that significant advances in technology will be announced as Tesla strives to produce the low-cost, long-lasting batteries that could put its electric cars on a more equal footing with cheaper gasoline vehicles.New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some of the developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan’s Panasonic, people familiar with the situation said.“Elon doesn’t want any part of his business to be dependent on someone else,�� said one former senior executive at Tesla who declined to be named. “And for better or worse - sometimes better, sometimes worse - he thinks he can do it better, faster and cheaper.”Tesla has battery production partnerships with Panasonic, South Korea’s LG Chem and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that are expected to continue.But at the same time, Tesla is moving to control production of cells - the basic component of electric vehicle battery packs �� at highly automated factories, including one being built near Berlin, Germany and another in Fremont, California where Tesla is hiring dozens of experts in battery cell engineering and manufacturing.“There has been no change in our relationship with Tesla,�� Panasonic said in a statement provided by a company spokeswoman.“Our relationship, both past and present has been sound. Panasonic is not a supplier to Tesla; we are partners. There’s no doubt our partnership will continue to innovate and contribute to the betterment of society.”Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Since he took over the fledgling company in 2004, Musk’s goal has been to learn enough - from partnerships, acquisitions and talent recruitment - to bring key technologies under Tesla’s control, people familiar with Tesla’s strategy said.They said the aim was to build a heavily vertically integrated company, or a digital version of Ford Motor Co’s iron-ore-to-Model-A production system of the late 1920s.“Elon thought he could improve on everything the suppliers did - everything,�� said former Tesla supply chain executive Tom Wessner, who is now head of industry consultancy Imprint Advisors. “He wanted to make everything.”Batteries, a big chunk of the cost of an electric car, are central to the Musk method. While subordinates have argued for years against developing proprietary Tesla battery cells, Musk continues to drive toward that goal.“Tell him ‘No��, and then he really wants to do it,�� said a third former Tesla veteran.The changes in battery design, chemistry and production processes Tesla expects to reveal next week are aimed at reworking the math that until now has made electric cars more expensive than carbon-emitting vehicles with combustion engines.Reuters reported in May that Tesla is planning to unveil low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles. Tesla is also working to secure direct supplies of key battery materials, such as nickel, while developing cell chemistries that would no longer need expensive cobalt as well as highly automated manufacturing processes to speed up production.‘STRAIGHT FOR MARS’Panasonic is partnered with Tesla at the $5 billion Nevada “Gigafactory��, while CATL and LG Chem supply cells to Tesla’s Shanghai factory, where battery modules and packs are assembled for its Model 3 sedan.Panasonic recently said it is planning to expand its production lines in Nevada, which supply the cells that then go into the battery modules assembled next door by Tesla.But the Nevada Gigafactory partnership almost didn’t happen, according to two former Tesla executives. Musk ordered a team to study battery manufacturing in 2011, according to one former executive, but eventually partnered with Panasonic in 2013.Now, Tesla is testing a battery cell pilot manufacturing line in Fremont and is building its own vast automated cell manufacturing facility in Gruenheide in Germany.The roller-coaster relationship with Panasonic mirrors other Tesla alliances.During its development alliance with Germany’s Daimler, which was an early investor in Tesla, Musk became interested in sensors that would help keep cars within traffic lanes.Until then the Tesla Model S, which Mercedes-Benz engineers helped refine, lacked cameras or sophisticated driver assistance sensors and software such as those used in the Mercedes S-Class.“He learned about that and took it a step further. We asked our engineers to shoot for the moon. He went straight for Mars,�� said a senior Daimler engineer said.Meanwhile, an association with Japan’s Toyota, another early investor, taught him about quality management.Eventually, executives from Daimler and Toyota joined Tesla in key roles, along with talent from Alphabet Inc’s Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as rival carmakers Ford, BMW and Audi.Some relationships did not end well, however.Tesla hooked up with Israeli sensor maker Mobileye in 2014, in part to learn how to design a self-driving system that evolved into Tesla’s Autopilot.“Mobileye was the driving force behind the original Autopilot,�� said a former Mobileye executive, who declined to be named.Mobileye, which is now owned by Intel, also recognized the risk of sharing technology with a fast-moving startup like Tesla, which was on the brink of collapse at the end of 2008 and now has a market value of $420 billion.But Tesla and Mobileye had an acrimonious and public split after a driver was killed in 2016 when a Model S using the Autopilot system crashed.At the time, Amnon Shashua, who is now Mobileye president and chief executive, said Tesla’s Autopilot was not designed to cover all possible crash situations as it was a driver assistance system, not a driverless system.The former Mobileye executive said there was no question of Tesla improperly using their technology.U.S. tech firm Nvidia followed Mobileye as a supplier for Autopilot, but it too was ultimately sidelined.“Nvidia and Tesla share a common strategy of developing software-defined vehicles powered by high-performance AI computers. Elon is very focused on vertical integration and wanted to make his own chips,�� said Nvidia’s senior director of automotive, Danny Shapiro.In addition to partnerships, Musk went on an acquisition spree four years ago, buying a handful of little-known companies - Grohmann, Perbix, Riviera, Compass, Hibar Systems - to rapidly advance Tesla’s expertise in automation. Maxwell and SilLion further boosted Tesla’s ability in battery technology.“He learned a lot from those people,�� said Mark Ellis, a senior consultant at Munro &amp; Associates, which has studied Tesla extensively. “He leveraged a lot of information from them, then put his spin on making it better.��	-3.051851852
(Reuters) - China’s top economic planning body is proposing to cut the tax levied on car purchases by half, as the impact of an escalating trade war with the United States threatens to slow the Chinese economy and affect demand for vehicles, Bloomberg reported on Monday.Shares of American and European automakers including General Motors GM.N, BMW BMWG.DE, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Daimler DAIGn.DE extended gains following the report.Reuters reported reut.rs/2RmNyto earlier this month that the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) has submitted documents to the country's finance and commerce ministries proposing the 10 percent auto purchase tax be halved.CADA has made proposals in previous years that have helped shape auto policy.China’s car sales fell by 11.6 percent to 2.39 million units last month, the most in nearly seven years, stoking concerns that the world’s biggest auto market could contract for the first time in decades this year.When China last cut the purchase tax three years ago, car sales soared in the world's biggest auto market that is a key battleground for global car makers from GM to Toyota Motor 7203.T.	4.766001376

TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp forecast on Wednesday a plunge in net profit for the current year, snapping three straight years of record profit, hit by a sharp appreciation in the yen.After net profit rose 6.4 percent in the year ended March to 2.31 trillion yen ($21.26 billion), Toyota is forecasting it will drop 35 percent this year to 1.5 trillion yen. That compares with the average estimate of 2.25 trillion yen for the current year, based on predictions from 28 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Toyota expects operating profit, which excludes earnings made in China, will drop 40 percent this year to 1.7 trillion yen, based on the assumption that the dollar will average 105 yen this year. The dollar averaged a far more favourable 120 yen last year. ($1 = 108.6600 yen) (Reporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)	4.835432751
LONDON (Reuters) - Global automotive supplier Bosch expects platinum to play only a minor role in its new fuel cells, giving precious metal markets scant benefit even as the technology gains momentum for pollution-free transport.According to Reuters calculations, Bosch would only need a tenth of the platinum used in current fuel cell vehicles.Hopes of reviving demand and prices of platinum increasingly hinges on widespread uptake of fuel cells in vehicles, ships and trains to make up for dwindling amounts used in each device, analysts say.The spot price of platinum has shed more than 40 percent in the last five years, burdened by persistent oversupply, before rebounding slightly in recent months.But hopes that fuel cells will boost long-term demand may be dampened after Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH told Reuters that platinum was expected to play only a “minor role�� in its plans to mass produce fuel cells.Privately-owned Bosch, which last month signed a deal with Powercell Sweden AB to mass produce fuel cells, said its fuel cell design was not finalised, but it expects them to use only as much platinum as a diesel catalytic converter.A catalytic converter in a diesel passenger vehicle typically uses three to seven grams of platinum compared with around 30-60 grams currently needed for a fuel cell for the same vehicle, according to analysts.“There has been lots of optimization work concerning platinum in fuel cells,�� Achim Moritz, product manager for mobile fuel cells at Bosch, told Reuters.“If you look at a diesel catalytic system, there is about the same amount of platinum content you need for a fuel cell,�� he added.He declined to give specific estimated figures for the S3 fuel cell system it is developing with Powercell and expects to launch by 2022, citing commercial sensitivities.Bosch’s fuel cell deal with Powercell, announced last month, was another signal that the technology is poised to be rolled out more widely as governments toughen emissions regulations.China is leading the way, targeting 2 million fuel cell vehicles by 2030.Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction using hydrogen as a fuel and platinum as a catalyst, but comprise only a fraction of the electric vehicle (EV) market even though they allow vehicles to travel much longer distances between charges than battery powered cars.For years, fuel cells were expected to boost platinum demand dramatically, but doubts have increased due to reports that scientists have found ways to cut the amount of platinum they contain.The best selling fuel cell vehicle, Toyota’s Mirai, is expected to cut platinum by two-thirds to around 10 grams per vehicle in its next version, down from 30 grams in the current model, according David Hart, director of E4tech consultancy, based in Lausanne.“They (fuel cell makers) all have a pathway of using less platinum, which is fairly clear,�� Hart said.Toyota Motor Corp declined to comment.Hyundai Motor Co has cut the amount of platinum needed for the fuel cell stack in the latest edition of its NEXO, released last year, to 56 grams from 78 grams previously, a company spokesman told Reuters.Hyundai plans to invest over 6 billion euros to make 700,000 fuel cell systems annually by 2030.Fuel cells give EVs longer ranges and recharging takes a matter of minutes, a fraction of what is needed for batteries.Hyundai’s NEXO has a range of 380 miles compared to 226 miles for the best-selling battery electric vehicle, Nissan’s Leaf.That is especially useful for heavy goods vehicles and buses, which are expected to be the primary market for fuel cells initially.“The heavy duty truck side is the biggest initial opportunity for fuel cells because they are very hard to electrify with batteries,�� said Mårten Wikforss, a consultant for Sweden’s Powercell.Batteries would take up more space in a heavy goods truck and would take hours to recharge.Once costs come down, fuel cells may also appeal to car buyers who do not want to worry about frequent and time-consuming recharging.If fuel cells catch on in ships and trains as well as road vehicles, platinum demand may get a boost despite the lower loadings due to the sheer numbers, some analysts said.Global demand for platinum for all fuel cells from vehicles is forecast rise to 366,000 ounces by 2030 but to surge to 965,000 ounces when including other fuel cell and hydrogen uses, said Jonathan Butler, head of business development at Mitsubishi Corp.	6.274310841
LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Toyota 7203.T intends to build the next version of its Auris car at its British car plant on the assumption that the government secures a transitional Brexit deal, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The final decision is due to be made by the end of the year, according to the sources and a government briefing document released to Reuters under a freedom of information request.The new Auris would keep one of Britain’s biggest car plants operating, secure thousands of jobs and provide a welcome endorsement to Prime Minister Theresa May.Toyota builds the current generation of Auris hatchbacks at its Burnaston plant in central England, with the run due to end in around 2021, but firms make model decisions up to three years in advance partly to organize supply chains.“Toyota UK management have a working assumption that the UK will retain the next generation Auris because it is too early to determine the nature of the trading relationship with the EU,�� one of the two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.“They believe that there will be a transitional period,�� according to the source who said the firm was highly likely to build the next-generation Auris in Britain.The final decision will be made by Toyota’s board by the end of the year and announced shortly afterwards, the sources said.Toyota declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A spokesman at Britain’s business ministry said it was a commercial matter for Toyota.In March, the company said it would invest 240 million pounds ($314 million) to upgrade to a new global car-building platform but has not confirmed which models it will build going forward.The platform investment decision was helped by a government letter reassuring the firm over post-Brexit trading arrangements, sources have told Reuters.Britain’s car industry is concerned that 10 percent tariffs, border checks and loss of free access to Europe could hit the viability of their plants if May fails to secure a good Brexit deal.May said last month that she would seek a Brexit transition period of around two years after Britain formally leaves the EU in 2019, aiming to appease businesses concerned that the country could leave the European Union without a deal.Finance minister Philip Hammond emphasized this week the importance to businesses of a period which would ease Britain out of the European Union and into a new trade relationship, causing as little disruption as possible.“We have got businesses that have to make decisions over the next few months,�� he told BBC radio, not naming which firms he was referring to.“Some of those decisions, once made, will be irreversible and if we don’t give business clarity over the future, they will have to make decisions assuming the worst possible outcome,�� he added.Toyota could delay its model investment decision for a few months, the second source said, as it did with its March architecture investment decision.A key part of the current decision-making is around how much they could increase the local supply chain, the first source said.In March, Toyota said its new vehicle architecture investment would also “promote UK supply chain efficiencies.”The Burnaston plant also builds the family Avensis car but Toyota has yet to make a final decision on whether to keep building the vehicle, whose sales have been disappointing.“They’ve not given up on Avensis,�� the first source said.In March, Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said no final decision had been taken on the future of the Avensis.“Can we afford to have a specific model specifically for Europe, designed for Europe, produced in Europe and sold only in Europe or do we want some thing that is a little bit more global which can be designed and produced in Europe but using more global components?”Japanese firms Nissan, Honda and Toyota built around half of British car output, which stood at 1.7 million units last year, but is likely to fall in 2017.In the first eight months of the year, Toyota’s British production fell around 20 percent with the Avensis model declining the most, according to the second source.May visited Japan earlier this year, partly to allay Tokyo’s concerns over Brexit. She met a number of business leaders including Toyota’s Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada.Her meeting came just weeks after foreign minister Boris Johnson also traveled to Tokyo in July.A government briefing note related to his visit released to Reuters under a freedom of information request, confirms that Toyota is due to make a model decision before the end of the year.“Toyota made machinery investments in Burnaston ahead of model decisions this year,�� the note reads.	3.254705351
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp 7312.T slashed its annual earnings forecast on Friday, and said it had yet to determine the full impact of a global safety recall as customers began ditching its air bag inflators.U.S. auto safety regulators earlier this week linked Takata's failing inflators to the use of ammonium nitrate as a propellant, prompting automakers from top customer Honda Motor Co 7267.T to Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T to say they will no longer fit the product in new cars, fanning concerns over Takata's future.On Friday, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it, too, would stop using Takata inflators containing ammonium nitrate, which U.S. regulators believe can cause air bags to explode with excessive force, spraying shrapnel inside the vehicle. Regulators have linked them to eight deaths, all in Honda cars, triggering the recall of tens of millions of vehicles worldwide.Takata is the only supplier to use the volatile chemical in its air bags.Takata said it expects a net profit of 5 billion yen ($41.04 million) in the year to end-March, just a quarter of what it estimated three months ago. The Tokyo-based firm booked a combined special loss of 17.2 billion yen for the April-September period to pay a $70 million fine and legal fees.The company said it did not expect any major impact this year from its customers dropping its products, and had yet to determine the future effects. Takata does not disclose how much inflators contribute to its overall business, but air bag products accounted for 38 percent of revenue last year.Bloomberg News reported that Takata had hired SMBC Nikko to draw up a fundraising plan, but a senior Takata executive said the company has no cash flow or financing issues.“Takata is currently facing no problem in financing,�� Yoichiro Nomura, Takata’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, told reporters. “I’m saying we have no problem from a cash flow perspective.”Takata shares have lost nearly 40 percent of their value in three days as automakers have weighed dropping the supplier’s inflators after the main U.S. auto safety regulator slapped Takata with a fine and ordered it to stop using ammonium nitrate in its inflators.Takata has said it would phase out the chemical, used in the majority of its inflators, by the end of 2018.Some customers signalled a willingness to continue using Takata’s products as long as they do not contain ammonium nitrate.Toyota President Akio Toyoda said the world’s top-selling automaker would no longer use Takata’s inflators containing ammonium nitrate, but said it would consider other Takata inflators as long as they were safe.“Even if they’re made by Takata, we intend to take an unbiased approach (on other inflators) as long as we can confirm their safety,�� he told reporters on Friday.Mazda on Thursday said it would drop all Takata inflators containing ammonium nitrate from its new cars. Subaru-maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T said they were considering doing the same. 	1.81418809
TOKYO, May 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will visit Japan on May 24 to meet with Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi to accelerate trade talks ahead of a summit meeting scheduled a few days later, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan said on Monday.After a late-April meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump had said it was possible for the two countries to reach a new bilateral trade deal by the time he visits Tokyo in late May.On Friday, Trump angered foreign automakers including Toyota Motor Corp by declaring that some imported vehicles and parts posed a national security threat, while delaying a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose tariffs to allow more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission on Wednesday said it launched an investigation into whether Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries infringed hybrid electric vehicle patents owned by Baltimore-based Paice LLC.The commission said it has not made any decisions on the merits of the case. But a ruling against Volkswagen could be a significant setback to the automaker’s strategy to shift towards hybrid vehicles after a crushing emissions fraud scandal halted sales of its diesel vehicles in the United States last year.Paice is seeking an ITC order that would block the import and sale of Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche brand hybrid vehicles in the U.S. market. It filed its initial request on April 15.After a similar ITC complaint and federal lawsuits against Toyota Motor Corp, Paice struck a licensing deal in 2010 with Toyota that covers 23 hybrid electrical control patents. In 2015, it said it reached similar licensing agreements with Hyundai Motor Co Ltd and Kia Motors Corp.Paice claims on its website that it shared with Volkswagen its patented hybrid technology, including computer modeling and control algorithms with Volkswagen from 2001 to 2004 in a“But after learning everything it needed from Paice, VW abruptly ended the collaboration and never licensed Paice’s technology,�� the company said, adding that the automaker shifted its efforts to develop diesel technology instead.Paice, founded in the early 1990s by Soviet-trained electrical engineer Alex Severinsky, said it holds 29 U.S. and foreign patents related to hybrid vehicle technology. The firm is partly owned by the non-profit Abell Foundation in Baltimore, which has provided over $25 million in funding support and is also listed as a complainant in the ITC case.The Baltimore firm also has pursued patent litigation against Ford Motor Co. since 2014. In that case, however, Ford has managed to get some of Paice’s infringement claims dismissed by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, while several other challenges are pending.In Germany, a VW spokesman said the company “does not comment in principal in ongoing legal disputes��. In comments submitted on the ITC website, lawyers for Volkswagen and its subsidiaries described Paice’s patents as “weak�� and said pursuing an investigation was against the public interest.A submission from Edgar Haug, a lawyer for Porsche AG, said that Paice’s complaint relies too heavily on investments made by Hyundai and Kia as part of their technology licenses with the firm.“Neither Hyundai nor Kia sell competitive articles that replace or are a substitute for Porsche’s accused vehicles,�� Haug wrote.

DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Takata Corp has recruited three former U.S. transportation secretaries to help the Japanese parts supplier navigate a growing auto safety crisis associated with millions of its airbags, the company announced on Tuesday.Samuel K. Skinner, a former White House Chief of Staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary, will lead an independent quality panel while two other former U.S. transportation secretaries, Rodney Slater and Norman Mineta, will advise Takata as it struggles to handle a series of recalls.The move to bring in Washington heavy hitters shows a new aggressiveness by Takata in trying to contain the scandal involving potentially defective air bags that can rupture upon deployment, spraying metal shards at the vehicle’s occupants.At least five deaths have been linked to the scandal. Takata is also facing a criminal probe, more than 20 class action lawsuits, congressional scrutiny, and an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The move also put a fresh spotlight on the revolving door that has frequently spun between the auto industry and its regulators.A Takata U.S. spokesman did not respond to a question concerning how the former transportation secretaries would be paid.In announcing the former officials�� retention, Chief Executive Officer Shigehisa Takada said the company wanted to show the public and its regulators that it will not rest until it has resolved the air bag performance issues.He said the panel helmed by Skinner will produce an independent report on its manufacuturing processes that will be made public. He also said his company would take “dramatic actions�� to increase output of the replacement air bag inflators kits. That includes working with rivals and examining whether their products can be used safely, he said.“I know we can and must do more,�� he said in a Tuesday statement.Since leaving office, the former transportation secretaries now working with Takata have booked decades of experience advising corporate clients - often companies facing a reputational crisis.When Toyota was embroiled in a safety scandal about a faulty accelerator several years ago, Slater, who served President Bill Clinton, led a company-funded panel to examine how the company handled the crisis.The 2011 Slater report faulted the Japanese automaker for a culture skeptical of safety concerns, though it offered no opinion on possible mechanical faults. Toyota ultimately paid $1.2 billion to settle a criminal probe into whether it misled consumers about the deadly flaw.Mineta, who succeeded Slater as President George W. Bush’s first Transportation Secretary, was an executive with public relations firm Hill+Knowlton Strategies for more than six years after leaving office in 2006.Skinner has served on many corporate boards since leaving public life.Skinner and Slater, through representatives, declined comment. Mineta was not immediately available for comment.The auto industry and its regulators have been frequently criticized for an overly cozy relationship, but little has been done to formally crack down on the revolving door. Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer in 2010 introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have restricted such movements between NHTSA and automakersClarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said automakers have every right to try and boost their image with prominent consultants, but outsiders can see the tactic for what it is.“The bigger the crisis, the bigger the personalities,�� he said. “Toyota needed one former Transporation Secretary. Takata tripled-down on that.”Takata’s announcement comes ahead of a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on Wednesday that will feature executives from Takata and automakers, as well as NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman.The hearing will likely focus on whether Takata will heed NHTSA’s call for it to expand its largely regional recall of driver-side air bags to all 50 states.Hiroshi Shimizu, Takata’s senior vice president for global quality assurance, said in prepared remarks that a phased-in recall should give priority to U.S. regions with higher humidity - believed to be a factor in some air bag ruptures.NHTSA had given Takata until Tuesday to declare that its air bag inflators were defective and issue a national recall. The Nikkei reported on Tuesday that Takata was preparing to comply, but the prepared testimony did not address the issue, and the company did not respond to a request for comment.Honda North American Executive Vice President Rick Schostek said in his testimony that a national recall would lead to parts shortages, but the Japanese automaker was “seriously considering�� it for the driver-side air bag inflators.Toyota North American vice president Abbas Saadat said in his testimony that the automaker wanted “additional assurances about the integrity and quality of Takata’s manufacturing processes.�� Toyota and Honda called on Tuesday for independent industrywide tests of Takata air bag inflators subject to recalls.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global vehicle sales by Japanese automakers dropped by 34% in March when the coronavirus outbreak spread worldwide, and are set to fall further in the months ahead as the crisis continues.Demand for cars has plummeted as people have been ordered to stay indoors in many countries to control the spread of the coronavirus, leaving motorways deserted and deep uncertainty about the longer-term impact on the global economy.Analysts expect that this will put consumers off buying new cars, cutting 2020 global vehicle sales by around a third, compared with an 11% fall after the global financial crisis.In a sign of the damage so far, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Japan's four other major carmakers reported sales of around 1.82 million cars last month, down from around 2.77 million a year earlier.Their combined global sales for the financial year ended March fell 7.3% to 26.5 million vehicles, their lowest in four years, calculations by Reuters based sales figures announced on Tuesday by individual automaker showed.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, sold 779,151 vehicles in March, down 22.6% from a year ago. For the year ended March, it sold 10,456,593 units, down 1.4%Meanwhile Nissan sold 315,194 vehicles last month, a 43% drop from a year ago. In the year to March, its vehicle sales hit a nine-year low of around 4.8 million units as the pandemic piled pressure on Japan’s No. 2 automaker, which had already been struggling with falling sales and profitability.Most automakers are preparing for a big financial hit from the coronavirus, as lockdowns in the United States and Europe have kept buyers out of dealerships.But Nissan’s sales and profits had been falling even before the outbreak, forcing it to roll back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA, expects that the size of last month’s fall in global vehicle sales will continue in the next year, and anticipates a 35% drop in sales for the current financial year ending March.Plummeting sales in March suggest much weaker-than-expected annual profits at Japanese automakers, which will announce financial results next month. And it is likely to translate into annual operating losses at most Japanese automakers in 2020.“Every automaker is going to have to do whatever they can to preserve fixed costs to try and contain the situation,�� he said.“For Nissan in particular this doesn’t come at a good time because it’s trying to recover from some bad financials, and it has an old product line up and needs to invest in new product technology.”Nissan expects to post its first annual operating loss in 11 years, revising a previous forecast of a profit and delaying its results announcement to late May.	-1.446895041
NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Despite the yen’s recent retreat from record highs against the dollar it remains at a level that is driving Japanese automakers to shift production outside their home base and to North America in particular, industry executives said this week.The currency’s strength has eaten into automakers�� margins and made it more costly to build vehicles at factories in Japan.Nissan Motor Co is planning to move output of its Infiniti brand outside Japan, likely to North America or China, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on the sidelines of the New York auto show on Wednesday. He called the yen’s strength a “major handicap�� for the luxury nameplate.Toyota Motor Co’s youth brand Scion has also started to explore the option of building cars at one of Toyota’s U.S. assembly plants and is aiming to boost U.S.-made components, an executive said.“It pushes our whole engineering team to look at every item even closer because of the yen situation,�� said Jack Hollis, head of the Scion brand, while adding it was “nowhere near a decision point�� on its production plans.One dollar bought 82.36 yen in Wednesday trading, having bounced off a record low at 75.31 plumbed last October.Japanese authorities have intervened to weaken the currency, worried the yen’s strength could sap exports and slow Japan’s economic recovery from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.A soaring yen makes it cheaper to buy commodities and overseas assets, but it also diminishes earnings from major auto markets such as the United States.That has made things difficult for Infiniti, which is a long way off from meeting Ghosn’s goal of making up 10 percent of global luxury sales.“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where you’re producing in a country with a strong currency and selling in country where the currency is much weaker,�� Ghosn told reporters.Ghosn said he expected sales of the Leaf electric car would jump after the company moves output of the vehicle to Tennessee this summer. Nissan says the yen has made it difficult to build enough Leafs to sate demand.CUTTING OFF THE ‘COROLLA BRIDGE’�The dollar yen has obviously been a challenge for the company,�� said Toyota’s U.S. sales chief Bob Carter, whose company imports some Toyota Corolla cars from Japan across what Carter calls a ‘Corolla bridge.’A second shift at a Toyota plant in Mississippi is coming online, Carter said, and the company is working to boost the portion of North American parts on its vehicles.“Companywide, about 70 pct of our production is built in North America,�� Carter said. “That’s going higher now that Mississippi is building Corolla, cutting off the Corolla bridge, so that will be approaching 80 pct (this year).”Mazda Motor Corp is building an assembly plant in Mexico that will be operational in 2014, said Jim O’Sullivan, President and CEO of Mazda’s North American operations, which import some vehicles from Japan.“The exchange rate has put pressure on everybody,�� O’Sullivan said. “It does create stress in the system.”Mazda also confirmed last month it was offering buyouts to U.S. white collar employees, without specifying how many jobs it expected to cut as a result.Honda, too, is expanding production in Mexico. The carmaker, which started making cars in Ohio in 1982, says 85 percent of its North American volumes are sourced from North American factories.“Once we have that factory, probably our ratio will be higher,�� American Honda CEO Tetssuo Iwamura said.	-6.165036966

TOKYO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Tuesday morning after large cap stocks such as automakers and manufacturers of factory automation equipment rallied, with North Korea tensions supporting defence-related shares.The Nikkei gained 1.1 percent to 22,500.20 in midmorning trade, while the broader Topix added 0.9 percent to 1,774.80, with 32 of 33 of its subsectors rising.Automakers gained, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 1.8 percent and Subaru Corp adding 2.1 percent.Factory automation stocks also attracted buyers, with Fanuc Corp rising 1.6 percent and Keyence Corp gaining 1.4 percent.Banks were also strong, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group adding 1.2 percent and Mizuho Financial Group advancing 1.4 percent.Retail investors speculated that demand for defence-related equipment will increase after U.S. President Donald Trump put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism on Monday, lifting stocks such as Ishikawa Seisakusho and Howa Machinery 7.2 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

TOKYO, June 15 (Reuters) - Japan’s normally sleepy shareholder meetings are set for a shake-up this year as a new corporate governance code encourages disgruntled investors to speak out and forces companies to take demands for better returns more seriously.Combined with a separate “stewardship�� code, which holds fund managers accountable for how they vote, the new rules mean CEOs of poor market performers like electronics maker Sharp Corp may face unusually strong dissent in the proxy season starting on Tuesday.“The weight of any opposition vote is now heavier,�� said Nomura Securities analyst Kengo Nishiyama, who specialises in corporate governance issues.The governance code which took effect this month requires listed firms to appoint multiple outside directors and calls for shareholder engagement, addressing longstanding criticism that Japan’s firms neglected investors.It also says companies must consider the views of shareholders who oppose management-backed proposals but are out-voted. While the guidelines are not legally binding, the Tokyo bourse requires listed companies to “comply or explain��.Sharp CEO Kozo Takahashi will come under particularly strong pressure at the company’s June 23 meeting, after weak sales of smartphone displays and TVs forced it to seek a second major bailout from its creditors.Takahashi won 97 percent support for election last year, so a significant drop could raise doubts over his leadership.Toshiba Corp, generally considered a well-run conglomerate, is also in hot water as a probe of past accounting irregularities has kept it from closing its books for the year through March and forced it to suspend a year-end dividend.To appease investors, sources have told Reuters, Toshiba is considering a special dividend later.“Individuals and institutions will be pointing to the code, and it will put more pressure on management to have good answers to criticism,�� said Nicholas Benes, an early proponent of the code who heads the Board Director Training Institute of Japan.Even Sony Corp, which has doubled its share price in the past year thanks to restructuring and strong sales of sensors, is set for a challenge with criticism from former executives pining for the company’s glory days.Proxy advisory firm ISS is also recommending against re-electing CEO Kazuo Hirai as well as Sharp’s Takahashi, citing low return on equity (ROE).Even Toyota Motor Corp, after another year of record profits, is facing a battle over its proposals for a new class of shares.Proxy advisory firms are giving conflicting recommendations, with Glass, Lewis &amp; Co saying the “Model AA�� share plan will give Toyota more flexibility and ISS saying it would erode fiscal discipline.The California State Teachers�� Retirement System (CalSTRS), the second-largest U.S. public pension fund, says it will vote against the proposal at Toyota’s AGM.Despite the expected rise in dissent, however, investors in Japan are also enjoying the highest returns in years thanks to rising share prices and a drive to boost shareholder returns.In addition to hiring outside directors to meet the code’s guidelines, companies have also been rushing to buy back shares, hike dividends and boost ROE. Tokyo-listed firms will pay shareholders a record of around 14.6 trillion yen, or $110 billion, this year, Nomura’s Nishiyama reckons.Even industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp, long known for its cash-hoarding habits and cool treatment of shareholders as much as for its earnings power, is doubling its dividend payout ratio after pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb.But the CEO of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager, is urging Japanese companies to think long-term.Companies must “resist the pressure of short-term shareholders to extract value from the company if it would compromise value creation for long-term owners,�� Larry Fink wrote to in a recent letter seen by Reuters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T outsold Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE for the fourth straight month in October to remain the world's top-selling automaker so far this year, after sales at the German carmaker suffered following the diesel emissions scandal.Toyota said on Friday its group vehicle sales totaled 8.35 million in the January-October period, more than the 8.26 million vehicles delivered by Volkswagen during the same period. Toyota has continuously out sold Volkswagen on a year-to-date basis since July.Earlier this month, Volkswagen said its Volkswagen brand sales fell 5.3 percent year-on-year in October, the first full month after Europe’s biggest automaker admitted that it cheated diesel emissions tests in some of its cars sold in the United States since 2009.Group sales at the Japanese automaker in the year through October eased 1.2 percent from the previous year, while Volkswagen group sales for same period eased 1.7 percent on the year.	0.0401864652
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co expects to recall more than 1 million more vehicles with potentially defective air bags, expanding a massive, multi-company air bag recall, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The recall involves faulty air bag inflators supplied by Takata Corp and would follow a similar move this week by Toyota Motor Corp. The Honda recall should be announced by the end of June, according to the person who asked not to be identified.Honda, while waiting for further information from Takata on its inflator problems, is also investigating on its own how many vehicles it may need to call back and where they are, according to the individual. The number of vehicles it could recall is likely to exceed the 1.135 million vehicles Honda called back globally last year, the person said.Asked whether Honda will expand airbag-related recalls from last year, spokeswoman Akemi Ando said: “We are conducting investigations quickly and if we decide that there are vehicles that should be called back, we will swiftly file for a recall.”Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, on Wednesday called back 1.62 million previously recalled vehicles outside of Japan as well as 650,000 more in Japan not previously recalled. The additional vehicles brought to more than 7 million the total number of cars equipped with Takata air bags to be called back worldwide over the last five years.Toyota’s recall from 2013 was a part of a bigger recall by car makers that also include Honda, Nissan Motor Co and BMW. In total, they recalled about 3.6 million vehicles with air bag inflators that could explode in an accident and send pieces of shrapnel into the vehicle.Toyota said it has determined that the serial numbers of potentially faulty inflators that Takata previously supplied were incomplete. Takata said it supports Toyota’s decision to recall the vehicles.The U.S. auto industry regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said it had opened a probe this week into an estimated 1,092,000 vehicles made by not only Toyota, but also Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Fiat SpA’s Chrysler Group after receiving six reports of air bags not deploying properly in the humid climates of Florida and Puerto Rico.	3.948287911
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T blames its China underperformance on the widespread anti-Japan protests triggered by a territorial row. Some company insiders and dealers, though, say the world's biggest car maker misread the world's largest market.They say Toyota’s launch of the Yaris subcompact in 2008, aimed at building brand loyalty and driving the Japanese firm to China sales of 1 million vehicles a year, failed to register with its target market - China’s army of price-conscious buyers.The Yaris, a success elsewhere, also failed to attract China's new emerging middle class. To some dealers and those within the company, the Yaris lacked what the Chinese call 'daqi' or 'road presence'. Next to Nissan Motor Co Ltd's 7201.T pricier Tiida, for example, it feels cramped and lacks pizzaz.Crucially, for more frugal first-time buyers, the Yaris was over-priced, costing from 87,000 yuan ($13,900), 55 percent more than General Motor's GM.N Chevy Sail, and putting Toyota at a competitive disadvantage in a must-win market.“The Yaris is too expensive, way too sleek for its target market. This group of consumers is very, very price sensitive,�� said an operator of a few dozen Toyota dealerships across China.Sales of the Yaris in China averaged just 1,250 a month, according to January-August data, and that’s before the impact of the often violent protests against Japanese products in a row over disputed islands in the East China Sea. By contrast, Nissan sold 12,000 of its Tiida subcompacts per month and GM shifted 17,000 Chevy Sails.The misstep in China is a black eye for Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda, the founding-family scion who used to run the firm’s China operations, and who also has had to deal with a major recall and last year’s Japan quake and tsunami that paralysed parts production.A decade ago, he and his lieutenants set the “aspirational�� goal of selling 1 million cars a year in China, taking around a 10 percent market share, said a senior China-based Toyota executive, who did not want to be identified because he was discussing non-public information.The automaker will again likely miss that goal this year, with Toyota officials blaming the territorial row between Asia’s two biggest economies. Its longer-term pledge to boost sales to 1.8 million cars a year by 2015 also looks a stretch. Toyota and its local partners sold 883,400 vehicles in China last year.Some Toyota dealers lament what could have been - if the automaker had had an entry-level model that sold as many as 100,000 vehicles a year, as initially envisioned for the Yaris.“If they had executed their small car planning right, Toyota could have easily hit the 1 million unit sales milestone or 10 percent market share objective several years ago,�� said a major operator of Toyota dealerships, who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of his comments.Toyota spokesman Akihiro Yamamoto declined to comment on the dealer’s view, saying only the company should “continue to strive to provide products that satisfy and appeal to more Chinese consumers��.Toyota’s fix for the Yaris problem is a new, affordable minicar which it has developed specifically for China. Toyota sources said the car is loosely based on the no-frills Etios, which sells for as low as $8,350 in India and is expected to hit showrooms in China as early as next year.The automaker is adding a few upgrades to appeal to Chinese consumers, taking the price tag closer to $10,000, according to the company sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details are not public. That would make it more competitive with GM’s Chevy Sail, which costs about 56,000 yuan ($9,000) and well below the Nissan Tiida, which starts at about 100,000 yuan ($16,000).To succeed, say some Toyota insiders, the firm has to heed the lessons from the Yaris, and think more locally.“Our way of beefing up operations in China is to bring in more people from Japan,�� says a top Toyota executive critical of his company’s China strategy, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. “We should be localising our business here, promoting Chinese managers, and listening more attentively to Chinese consumers. But we don’t.”Toyota’s Yamamoto said it is a stretch to associate the Yaris�� slower-than-expected sales with the degree of localisation of the company’s operations in China. “We’re promoting more local Chinese employees to management ranks and will continue to do so,�� he said.The new car, and the moves to more localised thinking, suggest Toyota has taken its past mistakes on board.Almost a decade ago, Toyota’s Japan-based product planners ignored the advice of sales executives in China to use an affordable car under development that had been designed for emerging markets, like China. The planners thought the car lacked edge for Chinese buyers and decided to introduce it in India instead. That car later became the Etios.Nor did Toyota seek help from its minicar affiliate Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd 7262.T, believing Daihatsu cars were not upscale enough.It also felt no immediate need to come up with a low-cost China car designed from the ground up. Instead, several top executives pushed the Yaris because it was one of the few lower priced, left-hand-drive, small cars available - and it had a global supply base for parts that could be used in China.‘DEAR QIN’Yamamoto declined to elaborate on the new low-cost model, but pointed to a concept car Toyota showed earlier this year for hints. The ‘Dear Qin�� has been styled to woo China’s entry-level consumers, especially first-time buyers in their 20s and early 30s.Masaki Taketani, director of research firm IHS Automotive, said Toyota upgraded the bare-bones Etios but kept it affordable by using a new, low-cost platform called Entry Family Compact. The platform meshes some new technology with lower-cost underpinnings from an older, retired small car model.Toyota is likely to launch a sedan version of the new model in China next September, followed by a hatchback in December, he said. Toyota and its parts suppliers have told IHS they are counting on the new sedan and hatchback to generate combined annual sales of up to 250,000 - a goal IHS�� Taketani thinks is optimistic. Given the intense competition in the low-cost small car segment, he reckons Toyota could do well to sell 100,000 cars combined.“Gradually, Toyota is getting around to filling the gap in its low-cost small car line-up in China,�� he said. “But it’s still doubtful that the new car’s going to be a runaway success like GM’s Sail and Nissan’s Tiida.�� ($1 = 6.2503 Chinese yuan)	11.66903317
"BERLIN (Reuters) - Leading carmakers including Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Toyota 7203.T pledged on Wednesday to uphold ethical and socially responsible standards in their purchases of minerals for an expected boom in electric vehicle production. Demand for minerals such as cobalt, graphite and lithium is forecast to soar in the coming years as governments crack down on vehicle pollution and carmakers step up their investments in electric models.To cover its plans for more than 80 new models by 2025, Volkswagen (VW) alone is looking for partners in China, Europe and North America to provide battery cells and related technology worth more than 50 billion euros ($59 billion).Talks with major cobalt producers, including Glencore GLEN.L, at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters last week ended without a deal.More than half of the world’s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country racked by political instability and legal opacity, and where child labor is used in mines.On Wednesday, a group of 10 leading passenger-car and truck manufacturers announced an initiative to jointly identify and address ethical, environmental, human and labor rights issues in raw materials sourcing.The partnership dubbed ""Drive Sustainability"" consists of VW, Toyota Motor Europe, Ford F.N, Daimler DAIGn.DE, BMW BMWG.DE, Honda 7267.T, Jaguar Land Rover TAMO.NS, Volvo Cars 0175.HK and truckmakers Scania and Volvo VOLVb.ST. The alliance “will assess the risks posed by the top raw materials (such as mica, cobalt, rubber and leather) in the automotive sector,�� said Stefan Crets of the CSR Europe business network.“This will allow Drive Sustainability to identify the most impactful activities to pursue�� to address issues within the supply chain."	1.606775368
(Reuters) - Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk's net worth topped $100 billion on Friday, according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list, as the shares of electric-car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O see a more than five-fold surge in value this year.A large chunk of his wealth comes from the 21% stake in Tesla, according to Forbes. Tesla shares, which went public at $17 a piece in 2010, rose as much as 3.5% in morning trade to a record high of $2,318.49.The company became the world's most valuable carmaker by market capitalization on July 1 when it overtook front runner Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and has over the last 10 years made many of its retail investors millionaires.Musk is now part of an elite club of just four others with twelve digit net worth. His nearly $100 billion, however, is just about half the net worth of the world's richest man and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O CEO Jeff Bezos, according to Forbes.Musk, who co-founded and sold Internet payments company PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O, now leads some of the most futuristic companies in the world.Besides Tesla, he heads rocket company SpaceX and Neuralink, a startup that is developing ultra-high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to computers.He set up the Boring Company to make affordable tunnels below busy city streets to for an all-electric public transportation system to avoid the nasty traffic jams in U.S. cities.	2.703314959
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California said on Monday it will halt all purchases of new vehicles for state government fleets from GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and other automakers backing U.S. President Donald Trump in a battle to strip the state of authority to regulate tailpipe emissions.Between 2016 and 2018, California purchased $58.6 million in vehicles from General Motors Co GM.N, $55.8 million from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, $10.6 million from Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and $9 million from Nissan Motor Co 7201.T.Last month, GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and members of the Global Automakers trade association backed the Trump administration’s effort to bar California from setting its own emission standards, which are significantly stricter than the Trump Administration proposal’s preferred option.GM spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said in a statement it was unfortunate that California will stop buying its electric Bolt.“Removing vehicles like the Chevy Bolt and prohibiting GM and other manufacturers from consideration will reduce California’s choices for affordable, American-made electric vehicles and limit its ability to reach its goal of minimizing the state government’s carbon footprint, a goal that GM shares.”The other automakers declined or did not immediately comment.Starting in January, the state will only buy from automakers that recognize California's legal authority to set emissions standards. They include Ford Motor Co F.N, Honda Motor Co 7267.T, BMW AG BMWG.DE and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, which struck a deal with California in July to follow revised state vehicle emissions standards.In August, the Justice Department opened an antitrust probe into the deal and last month sent subpoenas to the four companies.“Car makers that have chosen to be on the wrong side of history will be on the losing end of California’s buying power,�� California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.California purchased $69.2 million in vehicles from Ford over the three-year-period, $565,000 from Honda and none from the German automakers.The state also disclosed it will immediately no longer allow state agencies to buy gasoline-powered sedans, with exemptions for certain public safety vehicles.California’s vehicle rules have been adopted by 13 other states.On Friday, California and 22 other U.S. states challenged the Trump administration’s decision to revoke California’s legal authority to set vehicle tailpipe emissions rules and require a rising number of zero emission vehicles (ZEV).The move follows a separate lawsuit filed in September by the states against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeking to undo a parallel determination.In August 2018, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, reversing planned 5% annual increases.The Trump administration’s final requirements are expected in the coming months and are set to modestly boost fuel efficiency versus the initial proposal, with several automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%. That would be less stringent than the Obama rules or the California compromise rules.CalMatters, a non-profit California journalism website, reported California’s decision to stop buying some vehicles earlier.	-0.06300315016
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - A group of 12 U.S. senators, including Democratic leader Charles Schumer, on Tuesday urged the Trump administration not to reopen the 2022 through 2025 vehicle fuel efficiency rules.The push follows a similar call by major environmental groups on Friday. After a push by major automakers including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is expected to announce as early as this week that the Trump administration plans to reopen a review of the fuel efficiency rules that could result in a reduction in requirements for automakers.

(Adds comments, full-year forecast)YOKOHAMA, Japan, May 10 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co projected a 22.6 percent rise in net income for its current business year as the weakening yen allows Japanese carmakers to cash in overseas profits at more favourable rates.But Carlos Ghosn, who heads both the Japanese firm and France’s Renault SA, said that while Nissan’s annual global retail sales volumes will reach a record, he expects the European market to face another tough year.“I think 2013 is going to be tough and I don’t foresee any growth in Europe probably before the end of (Nissan’s) mid-term plan, which means not before 2016, or even later,�� Ghosn told a news conference at Nissan’s headquarters in Yokohama.“We think the European consumer lacks of confidence. The European consumer is confused, he doesn’t know when Europe is going to get out of this crisis and until he sees or understands what’s going on in Europe, I don’t think (he’s) going to buy cars,�� he said.Nissan, Japan’s second biggest automaker by sales volume, expects global retail sales of 5.3 million vehicles in the business year that ends in March 2014, up from 4.9 million last year, when it eked out a 1.4 percent year-on-year rise.That paled in comparison with increases in the same period for Toyota, which rose 16.3 percent, and Honda, which grew 32.2 percent.Of the Japanese automakers, Nissan is the most exposed to China. The world’s biggest auto market accounts for about a quarter of its global sales.A sales slowdown there last year as customers spurned Japanese brands in response to a diplomatic spat between the countries has led to uncertainty about whether Nissan will be able to achieve its goal of winning 8 percent global market share by March 2017, with an operating margin of 8 percent.Ghosn was bullish, saying year-on-year sales in China were higher in April and that he expects a full recovery in China sales by the end of 2013, and that the overall mid-term plan is on track.The company said on Friday it expects to make a net profit of 420 billion yen ($4.23 billion) in the year to March 2014, below an average forecast of 475.1 billion yen made by 19 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Its profit growth rate forecast was also below Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, partly because Nissan, which tends to use more imported components for parts in the cars it makes in Japan than do its rivals, is less able to cash in on the weakening yen.In January-March, Nissan net profit’s grew 46.1 percent to 110 billion yen ($1.11 billion), above an average forecast of 100.8 billion yen net profit made by five analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will create a scheme to inject capital into large and mid-size companies suffering from the coronavirus pandemic, government and ruling party officials said, as the health crisis threatens to inflict even deeper pain on its ailing economy.The move would mark an escalation in the government’s crisis response, which so far has focused on loans and subsidies to small firms, in a sign of its concern over the widening damage from the pandemic.Under the scheme, state-affiliated lenders will invest in ailing companies by offering subordinated loans or accepting preferred shares, four officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly.Investment by the government will help companies strengthen their financial standing, which would allow them to borrow money from banks more easily and avoid downgrades to their credit ratings.The scheme will be included in a fresh package of measures the government will map out to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, and funded partly by a second supplementary budget for the current fiscal year that began in April, the officials said, confirming a report in the Nikkei newspaper.A panel of ruling party lawmakers began a series of meetings on Wednesday to work out details of the scheme, as well as discuss other ideas to forestall bankruptcies.Yoichi Miyazawa, chairman of the panel, told Reuters last month that the government and central bank may need to set up a special purpose vehicle to inject capital into companies hit by the pandemic.The world’s third-largest economy is on the cusp of a deep recession, as the pandemic has forced households to stay home and businesses to shut down. Japan has reported close to 16,000 coronavirus infections and over 650 deaths.Big companies in key Japanese industries, including auto giants like Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, have suffered slumping profits, stoking fears of a wave of bankruptcies and job losses that could devastate an already weakening economy.“If a big company goes under, it leads to several tens of thousands of job losses. It would also have a devastating impact on regional economies,�� Finance Minister Taro Aso told parliament on Thursday.“We need to make sure that doesn’t happen,�� he said.The government has said it will use all available tools to help Japan’s car and autoparts makers hit by supply chain disruptions, slumping demand and factory shutdowns caused by the health crisis.The Bank of Japan also plans to hold an emergency policy meeting as early as this month to set up a reward scheme for financial institutions that boost lending to small firms hurt by the coronavirus.	8.935442497
* Subaru exec says Toyota decision a surprise-reports* Fuji Heavy says plans to increase output of Subaru models at plantDETROIT/TOKYO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Fuji Heavy Industries , the makers of Subaru cars, said on Friday it would stop assembling Toyota Motor Corp’s Camry at its Indiana plant and use the spare capacity to build its own cars.Fuji Heavy received notice from its biggest shareholder that it wanted to end annual production of 100,000 Camry models at the plant, which also builds 170,000 Subaru cars a year, a spokesman for Fuji Heavy said.The end of production for Toyota in Indiana in 2017 was first reported by the Louisville Journal-Courier and local television station WLFI, citing Tom Easterday, executive vice president of Subaru of Indiana.The plant has has been making the Camry since 2007.Easterday said the announcement came as a surprise and that the plant had been told in the spring that it would build the next-generation Camry in a pact that has helped Toyota head off rivals in the competitive U.S. midsize sedan market, according to the reports.Fuji Heavy may use the idle capacity to raise output of Subaru models. The company had earlier announced it planned to raise production to 300,000 vehicles a year at the factory.Fuji Heavy this year expects sales of the Subaru Forester to jump 25 percent to 420,000 vehicles.Toyota which holds a 16.5 percent stake in Fuji Heavy, declined to comment, saying the company would not discuss future product plans. Japan’s leading carmaker also builds the Camry, the best-selling U.S. car, at its factory in Georgetown, Kentucky.	-7.290201594
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states opened the way to competing technologies for internet connected cars on Thursday, rejecting a European Commission push for a wifi-based standard backed by Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE.The result represents a win for BMW BMWG.DE and Qualcomm QCOM.O which support a rival 5G telecoms system.Germany, France and Italy, with powerful car industries, were among 21 countries to vote against the EC proposal at a Brussels meeting of EU representatives, an EU official said.This contrasted with EU lawmakers in April who endorsed the wifi plan over 5G technology. The auto and tech industries have been split over which technology works better and is safer.The European Commision, which wants to set benchmarks for a market that could generate billions of euros in revenues for carmakers, telecoms operators and equipment makers, has said wifi is available now, unlike 5G, and would help road safety.“We will therefore continue to work together with member states to address their concerns and find a suitable way forward,�� European Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said in a statement on Thursday following the vote.Other supporters of wifi technology, which primarily connects cars with other cars, include Renault RENA.PA, Toyota 7203.T, NXP, Autotalks and Kapsch TrafficCom KTCG.VI.Meanwhile the backers of fifth generation (5G) standard, which will hook up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment, include Daimler BMWG.DE, Ford F.N, PSA Group PEUP.PA, Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE, Ericsson ERICb.ST, Huawei, Intel INTC.O and Samsung 005930.KS.Supporters of 5G say it has a wider range of applications in areas such as entertainment, traffic data and navigation.The vote was welcomed by telecoms lobbying group ETNO, whose members have spent billions investing in 5G.“Mobile solutions and 5G are back in the road safety picture. The automotive industry is now free to choose the best technology to protect road users and drivers,�� ETNO director general Lise Fuhr said.5G supporter 5GAA said the vote represented “a strong signal to the Commission that technology neutrality should prevail��, Chief Technology Officer Maxime Flament said.“Only a level-playing field between existing technologies will allow safer, more efficient mobility on European roads.”EU ministers are due to meet on July 8 when they are expected to formally reject the wifi proposal.	1.366832583
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The credit rating for Bridgeview, Illinois, fell into the junk level on Friday after S&amp;P Global Ratings hit the Chicago suburb with a four-notch downgrade to BB-minus.S&amp;P cited debt pressures on Bridgeview, which issued $135 million of general obligation (GO) bonds in 2005 for a stadium that it owns and manages.“The downgrade reflects our view that the village will continue to face acute business, financial, and economic uncertainties related to its debt burden, particularly the debt issued for its Toyota Park stadium,�� S&amp;P analyst Blake Yocom said in a statement.S&amp;P placed the junk rating on a watch list for a possible further downgrade due to concerns over potentially reduced market access and weakened liquidity for Bridgeview.Steve Landek, Bridgeview’s mayor, said he believed the downgrade was triggered by a plan the suburb was considering to restructure $24.5 million of variable-rate bonds to a fixed-rate mode with a 2047 maturity. He said Bridgeview would come up with a better plan over the next 90 days.The credit rating agency said it expects Bridgeview, which has used restructurings in the past to ease debt service payments and minimize property tax hikes, to continue the practice, possibly pushing bond maturities out to years beyond the useful life of the stadium.It added that the “underperforming�� stadium has left the suburb with an “extremely high�� GO debt burden that totals about $256 million and “very weak�� liquidity.With seating for as many as 28,000, Toyota Park, which opened in 2006, hosts soccer games, concerts and other events in the village of 17,000 located southwest of Chicago.	-0.2027276078
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T has hired Exponent, a U.S.-based engineering consulting company enlisted by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T during its recall crisis in 2010, to investigate the cause of ruptures in some air bags made by Takata Corp 7312.T.The hiring of Exponent was first reported by Japan’s Jiji News on Monday and confirmed by a Honda spokesman in Tokyo.A consortium of 10 automakers led by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and which includes Honda has separately commissioned engineering firm Orbital ATK to conduct independent testing of Takata's air bag inflators, which can rupture with too much force, shooting metal shards into vehicles. Six deaths have been linked to the problem so far, all on Honda cars.About 25 million vehicles with Takata air bags have been recalled worldwide since 2008.	-2.414890673
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co once again topped an annual consumer survey on brand perception released on Tuesday but its lead shrank by double digits as competition in the U.S. car market increases.Ford Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, also held their rankings, but their perception scores dropped nearly 20 points.“Overall, the car-brand leaders do not stand out from the pack the way they did only a couple years ago,�� said Consumer Reports, which conducted the survey. In addition, the survey found that consumers see few difference between top car brands, Consumer Reports said.The survey comes on the heels of the Detroit auto show, when automakers showcased a range of sleek, fuel-efficient cars outfitted with technology aimed at younger consumers, who are less brand loyal than the baby boomer generation before them.Brand scores are heavily influenced by consumer perceptions of safety and quality, two areas of concern for the top three car brands.Lackluster new products, including the Civic, CR-Z, Insight and Pilot, hurt the perceived quality of Honda’s models. Ford was hurt by kinks in its touch-screen entertainment system on some models and transmission issues on two popular cars.Meanwhile, Toyota is still recovering from its recall of 8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles in 2009 and 2010. This year, the Japanese automaker’s safety and quality scores remained consistent with 2011 levels.Each of the top 10 nameplates saw their perception scores decline in the survey, which draws from a random, nationwide telephone survey of 2,045 people in early December.General Motors Co’s Chevrolet brand slipped 10 points while Tesla Motor replaced Subaru as the tenth-best car brand.	13.90460792
TOKYO, June 25 (Reuters) - Japan’s government and top carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp, are joining forces to bet big that they can speed up the arrival of the fuel cell era: a still costly and complex technology that uses hydrogen as fuel and could virtually end the problem of automotive pollution.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth strategy, announced on Tuesday, included a call for subsidies and tax breaks for buyers of fuel cell vehicles, relaxed curbs on hydrogen fuel stations and other steps under a road map to promote hydrogen energy.That will bolster plans by Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, and Honda Motor Co, Japan’s No.3, to start selling fuel cell vehicles in 2015. Toyota is expected to unveil the price and design for its new fuel cell car on Wednesday.With two of Japan’s three biggest automakers going all in on fuel cells, the country’s long-term future as an automotive powerhouse could now hinge largely on the success of what they hope will be a key technology of the next few decades.The auto sector carries special significance in Japan, providing nearly one in 11 jobs and about one-fifth of its manufacturing output. It is also one of the few big industries where Japan remains at the pinnacle of global competition after losing much of its edge in electronics and elsewhere.Japan’s ruling party is pushing for ample subsidies and tax breaks for consumers to bring the cost of a fuel cell car down to about $20,000 by 2025. The government is also aiming to create 100 hydrogen fuel stations by end-March 2016 in urban areas where the vehicles will be launched initially.“To stay globally competitive, Japan cannot afford to lag behind in this area,�� said Yuriko Koike, a former environment minister who heads a group of ruling party lawmakers advocating hydrogen energy.A fuel cell vehicle, running on electricity from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen, emits only water vapour and heat. Hydrogen fuel production from hydrocarbons emits some carbon dioxide, although Japan hopes to implement carbon-free production by 2040.Hydrogen vehicles can run five times longer than battery-operated electric cars, and their tanks can be filled in just a few minutes compared with recharging times from 30 minutes up to several hours for electric cars.The challenges for fuel cell cars nevertheless remain daunting and growth could be slow, especially given the expense of building up an infrastructure of hydrogen fuel stations and the likely reliance on subsidies until costs come down.“Even after 10 years, fuel cell cars are likely to be less than 10 percent of the Japanese market,�� said Ryuichiro Inoue, a professor at Tokyo City University and an expert in the auto industry.“This isn’t a strategy to talk about for the next 10 years, but for the next 20 to 30 years.”Even Toyota only expects tens of thousands of fuel-cell cars to be sold annually a decade from now as the new technology will need time to gain traction.The government’s commitment to hydrogen vehicles in its growth strategy, however, shows how far the technology has come since Toyota and Honda began leasing fuel cell-powered cars in Japan 12 years ago. Japan had set out bold predictions, later abandoned as unrealistic, of putting 5 million fuel cell cars on the road by 2020.Engineers have since overcome a variety of technological challenges, including cold-weather ignition glitches due to water freezing and the need to reduce loadings of platinum - the precious metal that fuel cells use as a catalyst.Rivals such as South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Daimler AG are also producing fuel-cell vehicles, but Japan believes it will have an advantage after the UN adopted many of its proposals for global fuel-cell safety standards last June. This means it can avoid major changes to fuel cell specifications for exports, keeping costs low.Toyota, which astounded rivals 17 years ago by developing the Prius hybrid car in barely two years and then swallowed initial losses to establish its dominance in the segment, is confident of its prospects in fuel cells.“When we first introduced the Prius, there was little way we could make a profit and our vision was longer-term, for the second- and third-generation models,�� Toyota managing officer Satoshi Ogiso told Reuters in March.“Unless you are willing to accept losses initially, it’s not possible to increase sales.�� (Editing by Edmund Klamann and Rachel Armstrong)	1.838767345

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico should move to deepen its economic ties with China after U.S. congressional approval of a new North American trade deal, a senior Mexican official said late on Saturday.Jesus Seade, the deputy foreign minister for North America and Mexico’s top trade negotiator, said that as the second year of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s six-year term got underway, boosting economic ties with China was vital.Last week, the U.S. Senate completed ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a deal negotiated at the behest of President Donald Trump to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Canada’s parliament is expected to approve soon.Writing on Twitter shortly before midnight, Seade said Mexico should take steps to capitalize on the investment potential China offered, noting that his country’s appeal to the Asian economy “grew enormously�� with the USMCA deal.Some Asian businesses wasted little time in committing investment to Mexico once the USMCA had passed U.S. Congress.One day later, Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corp said it would move production of its mid-size Tacoma pick-up truck from the United States to Mexico.	-3.188650091

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T plans a $1.8 billion share buyback, Japan's biggest automaker said on Thursday, after beating quarterly forecasts on higher global vehicle sales and an improved performance in North America.Operating profit rose 14% to 662.3 billion yen ($6.1 billion) for the three months to September 30 as Toyota enjoyed its strongest second quarter since 2015.The profit beat an average forecast of 592.3 billion yen, based on estimates from nine analysts, Refinitiv data showed.It sold 2.75 million vehicles globally, up from 2.18 million a year earlier.Sales in North America, Toyota’s biggest market, rose 5.6%, while sales in Asia climbed 3.4%.Operating profit in North America, which has been a sore spot for Toyota over the past two years, more than doubled helped by less discounting.“New models of the RAV4 and the Corolla, as well as last year’s Camry, have been well received in North America, so we’ve been able to lower incentives,�� Operating Officer Kenta Kon told reporters at a briefing.For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit and vehicle sales, click on tmsnrt.rs/312ftUgToyota said it would buy back up to $1.8 billion worth of its common stock, or 34 million shares, by end-March.It maintained its forecast for operating profit in the year to March to fall 2.7%, after three years of gains, as it expects a strengthening yen to weigh.It lowered its forecast for annual global car sales by 2.7% to 10.7 million units, weighed by weakening demand in India, Indonesia and Thailand. Still, it expects record sales topping last year’s 10.6 million.‘EVERY LAST DROP’Toyota's projected profit slip is subdued versus smaller rivals including Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T Subaru Corp 7270.T and Mazda Motors Corp 7261.T, which have slashed their full-year outlooks by up to 67% this month amid weaker demand for their cars.Many of them acknowledge they are struggling to contain costs amid the need to invest heavily to develop self-driving cars and electric vehicles.Toyota also said higher R&amp;D investments and rising labor costs had made cost-cutting a challenge, but it managed an additional 45 billion yen in cost savings during the quarter.Executive Vice President Mitsuru Kawai told reporters that the company was looking at every possible way to cut production costs and improve efficiency at its factories, including scraping out “every last drop�� of vehicle body paint from the can before opening a new one.��(Each drop of paint) on its own would represent only a fraction of a yen in savings, but if we add up these efforts we can build a savings effect,�� he said.	-0.6789864203
* Rally Mexico cut short due to coranavirus travel restrictions* Teams needed to end early to be sure of getting home* Ogier wins event for sixth time, leads championship (Adds detail)March 15 (Reuters) - Sebastien Ogier won Rally Mexico for a sixth time on Sunday after the world championship event was cut short due to changing travel restrictions resulting from the global coronavirus outbreak.The decision to end the rally after Saturday’s second leg, enough distance to allow full championship points to be awarded, was to ensure teams and officials could travel home to Europe from Mexico.The United States is imposing new restrictions on entry from midnight on Monday and battered U.S. airlines are planning more flight cuts. Some European countries have also gone into lockdown.“A victory is a victory of course, but this one feels different from any other,�� said six times world champion Ogier, who now leads the championship from Toyota team mate Elyn Evans by eight points.“It’s hard to celebrate in these circumstances.”Reigning world champion Ott Tanak finished second for Hyundai, fighting back from a Friday setback to end 27.8 seconds behind Ogier, with M-Sport Ford’s Teemu Suninen third and previous championship leader Evans fourth.Ogier had led the Leon-based gravel event in the state of Guanajuato since Friday morning and finished with four stage wins.The victory was the Frenchman’s first since he joined Toyota from Citroen at the end of last season and sixth in eight years in Mexico. Ogier has also now won in Mexico with four different manufacturers and racked up 48 career wins.With the cancellation of Sunday’s final leg, the usual bonus points available from the closing ‘Power Stage�� were not awarded.Toyota are 21 points clear of Hyundai at the top of the manufacturers�� standings.Portugal, on May 21-24, is the next scheduled round of the championship but that could change.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s commerce minister has asked automakers to find ways to reduce royalty payments to foreign parent companies for use of technology or brand names, two sources told Reuters, in an effort to boost local investment and reduce outflows.In India's competitive auto market, top-selling carmakers Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and Hyundai Motor's 005380.KS local unit pay millions of dollars in royalties to parent companies in Japan and South Korean for using their technology and brand to build and sell cars.The minister, Piyush Goyal, in a meeting last week asked officials from groups representing carmakers and auto parts manufacturers to review such payments with a view to reducing them, said people with direct knowledge of the discussions.“The concern raised during the meeting was that the outflow is high, even for old technologies, and something should be done about it,�� said one of the sources.The sources declined to be named as the talks are private.The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.India, for years, has debated imposing stricter caps on royalty payments which spiked after 2009 when foreign investment rules were eased and restrictions on such payments were removed.The country’s markets regulator last year suggested imposing curbs on payments exceeding 2% of revenue. The limit was finally set at 5% after complaints from some sectors and fears it may dissuade foreign firms from investing or sharing technology.Recently however, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has made a renewed push to make the country a major manufacturing hub by encouraging domestic production and curbing imports. It also wants to increase local investment and reduce foreign outflows.While India does not restrict the amount that can be paid as royalty, any payment by a locally listed company exceeding 5% of revenues needs shareholder approval.Listed companies such as Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and parts makers including Bosch BOSH.NS, Schaeffler India SCHE.NS and Wabco India WABC.NS typically pay royalties of between 1%-5% to their foreign owners.Maruti Suzuki paid 38.2 billion rupees ($510 million) as royalty to its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor 7269.T in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, amounting to 5% of its revenue, according to its annual report. Privately-owned companies such as Hyundai's local unit paid $150 million or 2.6% of revenue as royalties to its South Korean parent in fiscal 2019 and Toyota Motor's 7203.T India arm paid $88 million or 3.4% of revenue to its Japanese parent, government data shows.Royalty provision has been important in attracting foreign investments into various sectors in India, especially autos, said Vaibhav Gupta, partner at tax firm, Dhruva Advisors.“Depending on the form in which the government brings back such caps ... it may impact the ability of auto companies to benefit from the use of foreign brands and technical know-how,�� said Gupta.He said for many foreign companies royalties are a profit repatriation strategy and changes to these could impact operating and supply chain structures from a fiscal perspective.Maruti, Toyota and Bosch declined to comment. Hyundai, Schaeffler and Wabco did not respond to emails seeking comment.Such payments have also been a long-standing issue with minority shareholders.A February report by proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services showed royalty paid by 31 leading Indian companies with foreign parents, including Maruti and Bosch, grew 9% in fiscal year 2019 to total $1.11 billion.	-0.7100066563
"WASHINGTON/WARREN, Mich. (Reuters) - The head of the United Auto Workers union on Thursday said it was “too soon and too risky�� to reopen auto plants and Michigan’s economy in early May, citing insufficient scientific data and coronavirus testing to assure workplaces are safe.The warning from UAW President Rory Gamble on Thursday afternoon came as General Motors Co GM.N , Ford Motor Co F.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T took new steps toward reopening North American vehicle manufacturing operations in an environment where consumer demand is uncertain and worker safety paramount.Unionized Detroit automakers and non-union German and Asian automakers have been preparing to restart U.S. vehicle making operations by early May. Companies have shifted reopening dates amid uncertainty about government stay-at-home orders.Gamble’s statement appeared to derail plans by the Detroit Three to start bringing UAW workers back to vehicle manufacturing jobs on May 4. The longer the automakers cannot produce profitable U.S.-made trucks and sport utility vehicles, the longer they burn cash.The UAW leader’s statement was also aimed at Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has come under pressure from conservative groups and President Donald Trump to ease coronavirus stay-at-home restrictions.“At this point in time, the UAW does not believe the scientific data is conclusive that it is safe to have our members back in the workplace. We have not done enough testing to really understand the threat our members face,�� Gamble said.“We strongly suggest to our companies in all sectors that an early May date is too soon and too risky to our members, their families and their communities.”Gamble said the union was “happy with the auto companies�� response and cooperation on working through the health and safety protocols we will need in the workplace when it is appropriate to restart.”Earlier Thursday, GM began notifying front line managers to come back to work next week to get trained on new safety protocols designed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus as workers return to plants.“What we are doing is making sure the people who are going to lead in our plant facilities, and lead period, understand the protocols well enough,�� GM’s global head of manufacturing, Gerald Johnson, told Reuters in an interview Thursday at a former transmission factory in Warren, Michigan, where workers are now making face masks for donation to hospitals and GM’s own use.Johnson spoke before Gamble issued his statement. The GM executive took questions while wearing a surgical mask and protective glasses - gear workers will be required to wear on the job as they return, he said.Many GM managers must now learn how to deal with “additive and new�� safety procedures, Johnson said.GM will not rush to ramp up production, he said. “We think it’s smart to be limited and phased in our restart,�� he added, saying it “has to be metered by demand.”Johnson did not say when GM plans to restart operations. Suppliers said before Thursday they expected the automaker to begin some production work May 4.Separately, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Thursday it expects to gradually resume North American production starting May 4 and will impose significant new safety procedures after it halted operations in March because of the coronavirus outbreak.The largest Japanese automaker said it expected production will be slow next month. The company added it was not yet clear when the industry will be allowed to resume operations in Mexico. Toyota will add temperature checks for all plant employees, personal protective gear, use “touchless�� entrances and exits and will even bar non-emergency use of elevators.“There is no going back to normal for the foreseeable future,�� said Toyota Motor North America chief administrative officer Chris Reynolds. He said he expected production to ramp up later in May “to meet consumer demand,�� however.Ford Motor Co F.N is considering asking some workers to return next week to prepare for restarting production, a person familiar with the matter said. But Ford said it has not decided on a date for resuming production.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI previously said it hoped to resume North American production on May 4. But the company said in a statement Thursday ""we will only restart operations with safe, secure and sanitized workplaces to protect all of our employees.""Other automakers have outlined plans to restart U.S. plants over the next two to three weeks. Honda Motor Co 7267.T said on Thursday it was extending a shutdown of its North American auto plants by one week through May 8."	1.264686684
WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has recalled 3.37 million cars worldwide over possible defects involving air bags and emissions control units.The automaker on Wednesday said it was recalling 2.87 million cars over a possible fault in emissions control units. That followed an announcement late on Tuesday that 1.43 million cars needed repairs over a separate issue involving air bag inflators.About 930,000 cars are affected by both potential defects, Toyota said. Because of that overlap, it said the total number of vehicles recalled was 3.37 million.No injuries have been linked to either issue.Toyota on Wednesday said evaporative fuel emissions control units in models produced from 2006 to 2015 including the Prius, Auris compact hatchback and Corolla were prone to cracks, which could lead to fuel leaks over time.Of the 2.87 million vehicles recalled due to the emission control units, Toyota said 1.55 million are in Japan; 713,000 in Europe; 35,000 in China; and 568,000 in other areas.Late on Tuesday it recalled Prius models and Lexus CT200h cars made from 2010 to 2012 over air bag inflators that could have a small crack in a weld, which could lead to the separation of the inflator chambers.Of the 1.4 million vehicles recalled over the air bag inflators, 482,000 are in the U.S. market.The inflator could partially inflate and enter the vehicle interior, increasing the risk of injury, Toyota said.Sweden-based auto safety gear maker Autoliv Inc ALIVsdb.STALV.N confirmed on Wednesday that it supplied the air bag inflators involved. Autoliv said about 90 percent of the affected inflators were in Prius cars.Autoliv said it was aware of seven incidents where a side curtain air bag has partially inflated in parked Toyota Prius cars, but no injuries were reported.Autoliv has benefited from an earlier recall involving faulty air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata 7312.T.The company said in an April regulatory filing that it was investigating six incidents related to its air bags and a possible recall could cost it between $10 million-$40 million, net of expected insurance recoveries. (1.usa.gov/2946IzQ)Autoliv said on Wednesday it expected the cost of recall to be at the lower end of the range.The company's U.S.-listed shares ALV.N were down 3.6 percent at $106.06.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he was concerned about the Trump administration’s proposed June 1 implementation date for the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, saying that this would put undue compliance pressures on U.S. automakers amid the coronavirus crisis.In remarks on the Senate floor, Grassley said the quick launch date for the trade agreement is problematic for the industry when it is “facing significant supply chain disruptions to COVID-19.”Grassley said he was urging the administration to take very seriously the auto industry’s concerns about certifying compliance for their vehicles in such a short period and “to ensure a reasonable timely for entry into force of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement auto regulations.”�It would be prudent right now to let these companies focus instead on the health of their workforce and supply chains,�� Grassley added.Canada on Friday became the last of the three North American trading partners to ratify the agreement, with Parliament rushing through a vote before taking a three-week break to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.Groups representing U.S. and foreign automakers - including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, as well as auto dealers and suppliers - said in a letter that day to the U.S. Congress that they were ""gravely concerned"" by the June 1 date, including the new automotive rules of origin.The new trade deal, which replaces the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, will require 75% North American content compared to 62.5% under NAFTA, and 40%-45% content from “high wage�� areas. This is phased in over three to four years, but automakers have to certify compliance with the initial requirements when the agreement takes effect.Honda Motor Co said on Wednesday it is temporarily halting production in North America for six days because of the anticipated decline in auto sales due to the coronavirus outbreak, and will reduce production by about 40,000 vehicles."	2.943415377
TOKYO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The yen remains very strong against the dollar and the euro even after the Japanese currency’s recent weakening, the head of Japan’s auto lobby said on Thursday.The yen has dropped on expectations that Japan’s next prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will pressure the Bank of Japan to adopt aggressive monetary easing.“This is merely a correction of yen strength. Even now, the yen is extremely strong,�� Akio Toyoda, who is also president of Toyota Motor Corp, told reporters.Japan’s auto exporters are sensitive to fluctuations in the yen, which rose to a record high of 75.311 yen to the dollar in October 2011. A stronger yen reduces what car makers and their suppliers earn overseas and hurts their ability to match competitors such as South Korea’s Hyundai Motors on price.	2.375040484

(Reuters) - Car-sharing startup Getaround Inc has raised about $300 million in the latest funding round led by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, the San Francisco-based firm said on Tuesday.Toyota Motor Corp and some other existing investors were also part of the Series D funding round, Getaround said.The company, founded in 2013, has been operating its car-sharing service in 66 U.S. cities including San Francisco, Chicago and Washington D.C.The company said it will use the latest funding to expand in North America and around the world and to develop partnerships with automakers.Peer-to-peer car sharing is seen as a threat to traditional car ownership and many global automakers, including General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, have adapted to the changing face of the sector by entering into partnerships with firms like Getaround.The startup, which partners with Ford Motor Co and Toyota, also collaborated with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in April to launch Uber Rent in San Francisco.Last year, Getaround raised $45 million in new capital, led by venture capital firm Braemar Energy Ventures. Some of the company’s other investors include asset management firms Menlo Ventures, automotive services provider Cox Automotive Inc and actor Ashton Kutcher.SoftBank, with its $93 billion Vision Fund, is known for its appetite for big technology investments and is the largest shareholder in Uber. It has also taken stakes in China’s ride-hailing app Didi, India’s Ola and Southeast Asia’s Grab.	0.7919831906
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T will join on Tuesday a growing number of companies signing a White House pledge to boost U.S. job training opportunities.The third largest Japanese automaker will announce in Ohio it will provide expanded job training opportunities to 50,000 workers by 2025.Other major companies including Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google unit, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, American Airlines AAL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and General Motors Co GM.N are among more than 400 firms that previously agreed to offer education and training opportunities for U.S. students and workers.Rick Schostek, executive vice president of Honda North America, said in an interview that the company has long been committed to offering job training for its employees, but was trying to be more public about it. He said the 50,000 training figure “was a bit more than in the past.”Last week, Honda announced it had built its 20 millionth automobile in Ohio since launching production in 1982 in Marysville, Ohio.Honda has not always seen eye to eye with the White House. The company drew the ire of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump when it joined three other automakers last summer in adopting a voluntary emissions deal with California.It also was among Japanese automakers that expressed dismay with Trump’s March 2019 declaration that some imported vehicles and parts posed a threat to U.S. national security.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has emphasized the significant U.S. investments and employment by Japanese automakers in an effort to head off potential punitive U.S. tariffs on imports of Japanese-made vehicles and parts.Honda employs about 15,000 people in Ohio, a key state in the 2020 election and nearly two-thirds of all Honda automobiles sold in the United States last year were made in America.White House adviser Ivanka Trump said companies who are taking part “have pledged to ensure the continued success and growth of the American workforce.�� She added Honda’s announcement “means that 50,000 people will now have the key skill sets needed to contribute to the jobs of tomorrow.��	-1.780163888
TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday said it would reduce vehicle production in Japan by 122,000 units in June, as a lack of demand for new cars due to the coronavirus prompts the automaker to keep its plants running on limited operations.The Japanese automaker said the reduced output represented a 40% cut from plans for June made earlier in the year.

FRANKFURT/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s Teklas Kaucuk, which supplies parts to carmakers such as General Motors and BMW, has put itself up for sale in a deal that could value the company at as much as 700 million euros ($782.9 million), two people familiar with the matter said.The family-owned company - which makes rubber hoses and metal tubes mainly for use in air conditioning, brakes and electric vehicles - is being advised by JP Morgan on the sale.Teklas, which also supplies parts to Daimler, FCA, Toyota and Volkswagen, was not immediately available for comment. JP Morgan declined to comment.Teklas tried to sell itself in 2015 but the plan stalled after a diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen prompted investors to assess the impact of the scandal on Teklas’s sales. The cars sector has seen high-profile deals in recent months including KKR’s acquisition of Magneti Marelli and ZF Friedrichhafen’s purchase of Wabco for over $7 billion.But there has been less interest in companies producing technology tied to conventional combustion engines, which are under pressure as the industry shifts towards electric vehicles.The auction for Teklas is expected to kick off soon with potential suitors such as Cooper Standard and Bain Capital being targeted, the sources said.Teklas is expected to be valued at seven to eight times its annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about 80-90 million euros, suggesting it could fetch between 600-700 million euros, the sources said. Founded in 1970s, Teklas Kaucuk is based in the western Turkish province of Kocaeli. It employs more than 4,800 people at sites in Europe, Mexico and China.($1 = 0.8941 euros)	3.561301084
NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. 7203.T said it will move its U.S. sales headquarters from southern California to suburban Dallas, delivering the latest blow to California in a fight for jobs with arch-rival Texas, whose Governor Rick Perry has been actively poaching businesses from the Golden State.The relocation from Torrance, a Los Angeles-area city of about 150,000, will bring much of the Japanese automaker’s U.S. operations under one roof in Plano, Texas, including sales, service, marketing, advertising and quality. Also moving to Texas will be some manufacturing staff now based in Erlanger, Kentucky, and corporate operations staff based in New York City.Toyota is the largest employer in Torrance, accounting for more than 5 percent of all jobs in the city with 3,837 workers in 2013, according to the city’s annual financial report. About 2,000 people from Toyota Motor Sales in Torrance will be affected by the move, and about 4,000 U.S. employees in all, the company said.Toyota’s move, which will take place in stages between this summer and the end of 2016, is the latest by a major employer to defect to the Lone Star State from California. Toyota has been in California since 1957, when it set up shop at a former Rambler dealership in Hollywood.In February, Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY.N said it would move from Los Angeles to Houston. In 2009, power company Calpine Corp CPN.N abandoned San Jose for Houston and in 2006 engineering company Fluor Corp. FLR.N relocated to the Dallas area from Orange County.It’s “sad news,�� Torrance mayor Frank Scotto said at a press conference Monday. “Toyota has been an integral part of the city.�� He said his son-in-law works for Toyota, so he faces the prospect of having to travel to Texas to see his daughter and grandchildren.Toyota's decision also means all three of the major Japanese carmakers will have exited the state where they first got their footholds in the United States. Nissan Motor Co 7201.T in 2006 moved most of its operations from Gardena, California, to Franklin, Tennessee, outside Nashville. Last year, Honda Motor Co 7267.T decided to move a number of executives from Torrance to Columbus, Ohio.Perry has made luring businesses from other states a priority, making personal recruiting trips to sell what the Republican touts as a superior business climate, particularly lower taxes. California and New York State, both with Democratic governors, have been particular targets for the effort.On a poaching trip to New York last week, Perry challenged New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to a debate over which of the two states has a better business climate. There are about 50 people working in Toyota’s Manhattan office, and not all will be required to move.Toyota’s chief executive for North America, Jim Lentz, said Perry had no role in Toyota’s decision to move.Perry “is an interesting guy,�� Lentz said in an interview. “I’ve never met him. I talked to him on the phone today for the first time. This was never about Governor Perry courting us.”The company never gave California a chance to make a counter-offer, Lentz said, adding that it weighed as many as 100 possible sites over the past year.“California didn’t work out for a number of reasons, especially the distance from our U.S. manufacturing operations,”he said. It would have been “disingenuous�� to seek an alternative proposal from California.When it came time to decide on the site from the four finalists, Plano “was clearly No. 1,�� Lentz said, but not because of the incentives it offered the company.“Our decision was not based on the dollar amount we received,�� but rather on a friendly overall business climate and certain advantages for Toyota employees, from affordable housing and shorter commutes to the absence in Texas of a personal income tax.Those supposed quality of life advantages don’t ensure success in a big corporate relocation, however.Larry Dominique, a former Nissan executive, recalled how Nissan lost about two-thirds of its California employees in the move to suburban Nashville.While some employees liked the lack of income tax in Tennessee, which was akin to “getting a 20-percent raise,�� Dominique said many others couldn’t be persuaded to go. That included a sizeable number who were not their family’s primary earners.Culture change is another challenge likely to be on Toyota’s horizon, said Dominique, who now heads an automotive research and consulting firm in Santa Barbara.“You lose centuries of institutional knowledge,�� he said. “In some departments, like in planning or branding, you have to retrain people on who you are.”Some employees will begin to move this summer, though most won’t until construction of a new headquarters in Texas is completed in late 2016 or early 2017, the company said.Toyota has a truck assembly plant in San Antonio, Texas, as well as manufacturing and assembly plants in eight other states, including Kentucky, Indiana and Mississippi.Meanwhile, the departure from Torrance will leave more than a gap in employment.According to the city’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the company was also Torrance’s third-highest property taxpayer, with a taxable assessed value of $473 million or over 2 percent of the city’s total taxable assessed value last year. Toyota also paid the city $203,037 in water revenue.Torrance had a $271.5 million budget in 2013 and about $121.5 million in long-term debt. In December 2012, credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Torrance to Aa2 from Aa1, citing a moderately weakened general fund compared to pre-recession levels, increasing pension payments and public safety costs.The departure could also hurt efforts by Los Angeles to regain its footing in the job market. The region’s unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent in February, well above the national rate of 6.7 percent.	3.711627907
TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s slower-than-expected growth in Southeast Asia, its third biggest regional market, is becoming a headache as the world’s best-selling carmaker closes on its six-year-old profit record.In ASEAN - the biggest market for Toyota after North America and Japan, overwhelming Europe or China - the company has been hurt by government policy swings in Thailand and Indonesia and underperformed industry-wide growth.In Southeast Asia’s biggest car market Thailand, Toyota sold around 237,000 vehicles in January-June, down 2 percent from the same period a year ago. That compared to an industry-wide growth of 22 percent, as it was hit by the end of a government subsidy as well as weakness in fuel-efficient small cars.In Indonesia, Toyota’s vehicle sales are likely to have increased year-on-year in the first half of 2013, but at a considerably slower pace than the market as customers hold off purchases ahead of an expected launch of a new small car.Toyota’s ASEAN exposure is higher than its rivals Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co. ASEAN represents a little more than 10 percent of Toyota’s total global sales.Globally, Toyota has posted a 5.4 percent rise in its biggest regional market North America in January-June as the United States is seeing the strongest pace of annual sales in more than five years.In Japan, its second largest market, sales dropped 12 percent year-on-year after green car subsidies ended last year, but it is seeing strong sales of profitable luxury models.Toyota, which is expected to this year become the first automaker to produce more than 10 million vehicles in a year, had been on track to hit or get near its record annual operating profit this financial year.But its Southeast Asian markets could get in the way.“In the short term, sales are lower than expected in these countries and that could weigh on Toyota’s business performance,�� said Issei Takahashi, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.At the same time, export dependent Southeast Asian countries are bracing for a slowdown after years of easy credit, buoyant consumer demand and strong domestic investment. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to soon start tapering its stimulus programme that has fuelled the surge of credit in the region.A weakening yen that makes exports profitable and lets it convert money made overseas at a favourable rate have set Toyota nicely to boost its performance.On Friday, it is expected to post an April-June operating profit of 649 billion yen, or $6.60 billion, up 84 percent year-on-year, according to the average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.That would be the biggest quarterly operating profit in six years and just shy of its record, in April-June 2007, of $6.9 billion, or 675.4 billion yen, and is stronger than Volkswagen AG’s group April-June operating profit of $4.5 billion and General Motors Co’s $1.8 billion.For the financial year ending March 2014, Toyota is likely to post an annual operating profit of $23.1 billion or 2.27 trillion yen according to an average of 26 analyst forecasts, nearing its record profit of 2.27 trillion yen it booked in the year ended March 2008.Toyota, whose Thai market share dropped to about 32 percent in January-June from around 36 percent in 2012, last month cut its 2013 sales forecast for the market by 10 percent to 450,000 vehicles, despite having raised its outlook for industry-wide sales by 8 percent to 1.3 million vehicles.Toyota lags rivals in small, fuel-efficient cars that are increasingly popular in Thailand. Rival Honda has seen strong sales of the Brio Amaze in Thailand. Toyota has said it plans to sell a new model later this year.In Indonesia, where Toyota holds a 35 percent share, it has been hit by a delay in the implementation of the government’s Low Cost Green Car Programme to promote small cars, which was recently signed into law but is still on hold pending review. The government also rolled back fuel subsidies in June.	-7.466686518
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and auto-parts maker Denso Corp on Wednesday said they have agreed to set up a joint venture to develop next-generation automotive semiconductors as the industry moves toward connected and autonomous vehicles.Denso, a Toyota Group supplier, will own 51% of the new company, with Toyota holding the remainder, the companies said in a joint statement.They said they aim to establish the company in April 2020 with a capitalization of 50 million yen ($458,968) and about 500 employees.The venture will focus on components such as power modules for electric vehicles and periphery monitoring sensors for automated vehicles.Computing power is rising in importance as cars increasingly become connected to each other, transportation infrastructure like traffic lights, and just about everything else.Autonomous driving systems will also need the capacity to sense the world around them, interpret that data, and then make decisions such as whether to brake or veer to the right to avoid an obstacle, all within a fraction of a second.Toyota and Denso agreed in June of last year to consolidate their electronic components production and development at the supplier in order to improve efficiency and accelerate innovation.The two companies also banded together with another Toyota Group supplier, Aisin Seiki Co Ltd, to set up a development center for autonomous driving in Tokyo in March of last year, called Toyota Research Institute - Advanced Development, or TRI-AD.	1.16765286
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it will continue production at its domestic assembly plants between May 16 and May 21, as it was able to procure auto parts from a supplier whose plant sustained damage in a series of earthquakes that hit southern Japan last month.The automaker has extended production by roughly a week, after resuming operations between May 6 and May 14. Toyota stopped production lines last month for a week following the deadly earthquakes in Kumamoto.Toyota said it will determine whether the plants will continue to operate beyond that date after examining its supply situation.	4.835432751
JAKARTA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co may be missing out on a big opportunity in Indonesia by failing to build a major car factory in the country and paying too little attention to local needs in what has become a key emerging market for global auto makers.PT Hyundai Indonesia Motor -- the South Korean auto maker’s exclusive distribution partner -- plans to sell 8,000 Hyundai cars this year, grabbing less than 1 percent of overall auto sales which are expected to grow to 1.25 million cars this year, according to company officials.One big problem is the lack in its line-up of a small, no-frills multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) to challenge the likes of Toyota Motor Corp’s Avanza, according to two people familiar with PT Hyundai Indonesia’s operations.“Hyundai needs to wake up and understand the true potential of Indonesia,�� one of the sources said, noting that many global brands have invested heavily in the country in recent years. Among those is General Motors Co which is expected to start production of a small affordable car soon.The market, according to some industry officials, appears poised to surpass Thailand as Southeast Asia’s biggest by 2016, if not earlier, with sales reaching 2 million cars a year.The budget MPV with three rows of seating is a high-volume car in Indonesia, where such vehicles account for more than 50 percent of the total demand.The segment is currently dominated by the Avanza, Daihatsu Motor Co’s Xenia and Suzuki Motor Corp’s Ertiga - offerings that will soon be joined by a model called the Chevrolet Spin from GM.“If we don’t have a small MPV, how could Hyundai generate big volume?�� said one of the sources.Maintaining an ample supply of cars is also a challenge for PT Hyundai Indonesia -- a closely-held company part-owned by Indonesian businessman Bambang Trihatmodjo, son of former President Suharto -- due to manufacturing constraints stemming from Hyundai’s decision a few years ago to slow capacity expansion around the world and focus on quality.As part of that expansion freeze, which has crimped sales in the United States and India, among other markets, Hyundai has scrapped plans to build an assembly plant in Indonesia.Hyundai has also been focusing its resources on other growth markets such as Brazil and India.“Hyundai Motor has been expanding rapidly worldwide in recent years, forcing us to allocate our resources in other markets first,�� said Brian Sir, a Seoul-based Hyundai spokesman, in an email.“We acknowledge that the Indonesian market has great potential and continue to keep a close eye on new opportunities. For the moment, we do not have plans to build a manufacturing plant there.”The lack of sufficient supply for products also stems from Hyundai’s limited production capacity for right-hand-drive cars.Hyundai sales in Indonesia grew 33 percent and 26 percent in 2011 and 2012, respectively. But the brand remains a tiny player in a market dominated by Japanese auto makers.Toyota for example, sold some 400,000 cars last year, or slightly more than a third of the country’s overall demand.Hyundai’s Indonesian distributor currently sells cars through about 45 retail outlets. It plans to add seven more dealers this year and aims to sell some 10,000 cars in 2014.The company has a fairly large line-up of cars: the mini Accent and mid-size Sonata sedans, the Tucson and Santa Fe sport-utility vehicles, as well as the large Starex van. Of those, the distributor assembles Starex vans locally using near fully assembled vehicle kits shipped from South Korea.	1.364655425
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Detroit’s Big Three automakers on Monday reported higher Canadian sales for June and for the first half of 2016, on an annual basis, with forecasters expecting another record-breaking year.June sales hit a new record for the month, rising 7.4 percent to 191,088 on an annual basis, according to Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers on Monday. Sales of trucks, SUVs and vans grew 13.9 percent, even as sluggish sales of sedans declined 2.9 percent on an annual basis, he wrote in a note.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI, reported a total of 27,776 vehicles sold in June, up 2 percent compared with the same month in 2015. For the first half of 2016, FCA Canada said it sold 152,439 vehicles, a record high for the automaker.“At the mid-year point, FCA Canada is on pace for another record-setting sales year,�� said Dave Buckingham, ChiefOperating Officer, FCA Canada, in a statement.According to a June report by Scotiabank, Canadian auto sales are expected to rise to 1.96 million vehicles in 2016, up from a record-breaking 1.9 million units last year.In May, Canadian auto sales slipped 1.5 percent on an annual basis, the first monthly decline since December 2015, in part because the month had two fewer selling days.“The market rebounded strongly in June after a slower month in May,�� DesRosiers said. “Sales finished 6.0 percent higher for the first half of 2016, without a clear sign of slowing down.”Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors Co GM.N, reported higher Canadian sales in June, which had 26 selling days, compared to 25 during the same month in 2015. Ford said in a news release it sold 28,718 vehicles in June, up 7 percent for the month. Ford’s sales during the first half of 2016 rose nearly 12 percent to 149,942 vehicles.GM delivered 26,045 vehicles in June, up 8 percent on an annual basis. GM said its sales for the first six months of 2016 rose 2.3 percent to 130,202 units.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T sold 22,004 vehicles in June, up 6.4 percent compared to 2015. Sales for the first half of the year reached 113,410 units, up 8 percent on an annual basis.In the United States, which reported results on July 1, the pace of auto sales slowed in June compared to a year ago, as slumping sales of sedans offset strong demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles.	13.23855616
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Toyota's 7203.T zero-emission vehicle sales in California this year amount to a drop of hydrogen in an ocean of gasoline.The world’s largest automaker has so far sold about 270 hydrogen fuel cell cars in the state, where it delivered nearly 400,000 gas-powered vehicles last year, according to an Edmunds.com analysis of IHS Markit data. Toyota does not currently sell an electric vehicle.And yet the automaker will have no trouble meeting California’s zero-emission vehicle mandates �� because it can satisfy those obligations with state-awarded environmental credits instead of current zero-emission vehicle sales.The Toyota example underscores how the California’s complex credit system has left the state well off the pace needed to meet its clean-car sales goals. The state has estimated its regulations would result in zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs, making up about 15 percent of all California auto sales by 2025, but the current share has been stuck at 3 percent since 2014.For a graphic detailing California and U.S. zero-emission vehicle sales, see: tmsnrt.rs/2bFa91IToyota and other automakers have amassed stockpiles of credits through past ZEV sales or by purchasing credits from competitors that produce more zero-emission cars, such as Tesla Motors TSLA.O or Nissan Motor Co. 7201.T Some automakers have enough credits to satisfy state mandates for years without selling a single zero-emission vehicle, according to a new analysis from the Natural Resources Defense Council.The system also masks a more fundamental problem with the business of selling zero-emission vehicles �� weak demand from consumers.The California Air Resources Board, which regulates greenhouse gas emissions, plans to take up ZEV program changes by December, with a likely focus on the credit system, the backbone of its policy. That prospect has ignited tensions between traditional automakers and Tesla, the Silicon Valley electric car maker.State regulators are caught in the middle, taking criticism from both sides. Mary Nichols, chair of the state board, acknowledged the sluggish sales of ZEVs, which include electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. She said regulatory changes could be needed to meet state sales goals.“I’m concerned,�� Nichols told Reuters in an interview. “It’s a very ambitious goal and would require - if you look at where we are today and where we need to go - a big change in what consumers are seeing and what they’re buying.”Any policy changes will be closely watched globally by automakers, regulators and environmentalists, many of whom view California as the leading laboratory for green-car policy.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk recently told investors that state regulators “should damn well be ashamed of themselves�� for failing to require major automakers to produce more zero-emission vehicles.Others in the industry argue car makers have only limited control over how quickly consumers embrace vehicles that �� at least for now �� are inherently expensive or impractical.“It’s a mandate for us to produce vehicles, but there is no mandate for customers to buy them,�� said Michael Lord, an executive engineer at Toyota who manages regulatory affairs.‘IT JUST TAKES TIME’Tesla has benefited from some automakers�� decisions to buy more credits instead of build more cars: The electric car maker has to date reported more than $600 million in environmental credit sales.The credits and related subsidies have helped finance Tesla’s success so far in creating consumer demand for high-end electric cars, but the company has yet to turn a profit from selling $100,000 sedans and crossovers. Its long-term growth depends on widespread consumer acceptance of more affordable battery-powered cars.Now, Toyota and Honda Motor Co. 7267.T are building their own expensive, futuristic vehicles, ones that will net the companies far more credits than sales.Both automakers recently unveiled hydrogen fuel cell cars, which convert the fuel into electric power. They are essentially electric cars that can be refueled instead of recharged, which can take hours.Neither Toyota nor Honda expects these fuel cells to find a mass market. Hydrogen stations are nearly impossible to find outside of Los Angeles or San Francisco, and both cars start at about $60,000.But the Toyota Mirai and the Honda Clarity will pay off handsomely in credits �� nine of them for each sale, compared to four credits the state now gives a Tesla Model S or the three it gives a Nissan Leaf.The credits are currently worth about $3,000 to $4,000 each, according to a source with knowledge of the private credit-trading market among automakers. But they are worth far more to Toyota and Honda as a mechanism to satisfy state mandates while continuing to sell hundreds of thousands of gasoline-powered vehicles each year in California, the nation’s biggest auto market.The credits also buy time to develop more viable zero-emissions cars, said Honda’s Robert Bienenfeld, assistant vice president for energy and the environment. The credits, he said, make it easier to carry out the difficult and expensive development work required to bring zero-emission vehicles into a tough market.“Things do not always go smoothly,�� he said.Toyota has spent two decades and billions of dollars on research and development of hydrogen fuel cells, and the company believes deeply in the technology, Lord said. But he does not expect hydrogen cars to serve a substantial market for at least five or ten more years.In the short term, that may mean fewer ZEV sales as a tradeoff for developing higher-quality vehicles with longer driving ranges. Getting the cars on the street, even in small numbers, is essential to jump-starting consumer demand and the hydrogen-fueling infrastructure needed for wider adoption, Lord said.“It just takes time,�� he said. “Just as with hybrids, every generation is better the one that came before.”Building the cars may be easier than selling them, especially with falling gas prices and rising gas mileage of traditional vehicles. Nationally, zero-emission vehicles still account for less than one percent of U.S. auto sales.Most customers continue to shun electric cars because of their limited driving range - often less than 100 miles - and long recharging times.Tesla and Chevrolet are planning new models that both companies say will start at about $35,000 and travel 200 miles on a charge, raising hopes of overcoming consumer concerns. Tesla’s Model 3 is scheduled to begin deliveries late in 2017, following the Chevy Bolt late this year.Toyota has been a global leader in pushing vehicle electrification, but with a focus on gas-electric hybrids, such as the Prius, more than all-electric cars.Toyota also believes in a middle ground between the two - plug-in hybrids, which can travel some distance on all-electric power before a gas engine kicks in.California plans to give automakers fewer credits for plug-in hybrids after 2018, a move Lord called ill-advised.“We think plug-in hybrids have a bigger role to play, particularly in this transitional phase of electrification,�� he said. “It removes that range anxiety issue.”The credit glut is the main concern of regulators, Tesla and environmental advocates. The Natural Resources Defense Council study predicts the industry’s zero-emission offerings will only reach 6 percent of annual sales by 2025, even after a planned tightening of regulations in 2018.Nichols, California’s top auto regulator, said she likes the idea of limiting the number of credits any automaker could redeem in any given year, which could force companies to sell more zero-emission cars. It could also devalue the credits, however, which would hurt Tesla’s bottom line.Tesla has a different proposal - one that would boost the value of its credit bank. The electric car maker proposes quadrupling the number of credits automakers need to satisfy state mandates.Earlier this month, Tesla’s Diarmuid O’Connell, vice president of business development, sparred with lobbyists for major automakers during a conference near Traverse City, Mich. He chided the industry for fielding electric cars that don’t sell because they are slow and have all the panache of household “appliances.”John Bozzella, head of a group that represents several Asian and European auto makers, countered that most consumers don’t want electric vehicles - and pointedly wished Tesla well in its quest to achieve profitability.Many automakers, having made major investments in part based on California policy, are wary of any substantial changes. Nissan makes the all-electric Leaf, along with a fleet of gasoline models, and so it has incentives to argue both sides of the debate. But the automaker would prefer if the state board left the program alone.“Nissan is concerned with any proposal that materially changes a regulation midstream,�� said Ken Srebnik, senior manager, Corporate Development at the company.Nichols said it’s “not impossible�� that the state could meet its goals for zero-emission car sales under current rules. But it’s not going to be easy, either.“I certainly can’t tell you I have a vision of exactly how it happens,�� she said.	-4.759543877
NAIROBI (Reuters) - German automaker Volkswagen (VW) VOWG_p.DE plans to double output at its Kenyan assembly plant and could build a second model there, Kenya's presidential office said without giving a timeline.VW set up the vehicle assembly plant in 2016, resuming production in Kenya after a four decade break.

SEOUL, Aug 7 (Reuters) - South Korean imports of Japanese beer slumped 45% in July from the previous month in the wake of a consumer boycott sparked by an escalating political and economic dispute between the two Asian neighbours, data showed.Japan shipped $4.3 million worth of beer to South Korea in July, down from $6.6 million a year earlier and $7.9 million in June, according to preliminary customs office data provided by lawmaker Kim Jung-woo to Reuters.On July 4, Japan tightened export controls for materials used to make chips, South Korea’s top export item, intensifying a row over wartime forced labour and inviting a consumer backlash in Korea.Such anger has prompted a widespread boycott of Japanese products and services, from beer, clothes and cars to travel.Many supermarkets and convenience stores have been removing Japanese items such as beer from their stands and stopping new orders.South Korea buys 61% of Japan’s beer exports, spending 7.9 billion yen ($73 million) in 2018 for the shipments, according to Japan’s finance ministry.Asahi Group Holdings said last week the spread of the South Korean consumer boycott of Japanese goods was affecting its beer sales as it lowered its profit guidance slightly.A boycott campaign is expected to grow as Japan is taking steps to remove Korea’s fast-track export status, industry officials and experts say.Japanese automakers such as Toyota and Honda are bracing for further sales drops in South Korea in the coming months, after they posted sharp sales declines last month.A slew of South Korean airlines are also suspending flights to Japan as they brace for a dwindling number of tourists. South Korea’s second-largest carrier Asiana Airlines Inc and budget carrier Eastar Jet said on Wednesday they would temporarily halt a combined four more flights between Korea and Japan.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE will need to address some regional gaps as it seeks to become the world's largest carmaker, head of personnel Horst Neumann told German daily Handelsblatt, citing weakness in vans and light trucks in emerging markets.“We must not believe that we’ve made it, that we’re rich and invincible now,�� Neumann was quoted as saying in an excerpt of an interview to be published on Monday and made available to Reuters on Sunday.""Only then can we address remaining weaknesses. Compared to strong competitors such as Toyota 7203.T and Hyundai 005380.KS we have yet to establish a presence in certain segments, for instance in compact commercial vehicles in emerging markets.

* Wolfsburg HQ plant gathering planned for Wednesday* VW CEO and works council chief to address employees* Inefficiencies growing at VW - analystBERLIN, July 22 (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s chief executive will address thousands of workers at its biggest plant on Wednesday as he attempts to win their support for cost cuts at the carmaker’s core VW brand.Europe’s largest carmaker keeps boosting sales to new records but profitability gains are not keeping pace with the 12-brand group’s rapid expansion.CEO Martin Winterkorn plans to cut costs by 5 billion euros ($6.74 billion) a year from 2017 as part of efforts to streamline work processes at all levels of VW’s namesake brand, its biggest division by sales and deliveries.After telling managers on July 14 to step up their game, Winterkorn will on Wednesday address a special closed staff gathering at VW’s main factory in Wolfsburg, Germany that could draw about 20,000 blue-collar workers, two company sources said.Analysts have said the cost-cutting could expose rare differences between management and labour at VW where employee representatives, occupying half of the 20 seats on the carmaker’s supervisory board, enjoy considerable influence over corporate decisions.While there is no suggestion that the carmaker plans to cut any jobs, the efficiency drive also indicates that VW workers in Germany could be facing more difficult times ahead after years of generous wage increases and annual bonus payments.Bernd Osterloh, VW’s works council chief who also sits on the supervisory board, has urged management to cut out its own mistakes as it reviews corporate strategy.Management must prepare production plans - especially in car-body making - more carefully to reduce unnecessary overtime, and improve sales operations in foreign markets, he wrote in an internal document dated July 17 obtained by Reuters.“What’s at stake is an intelligent use of our resources rather than cost-cutting,�� said Osterloh, who will address Wednesday’s gathering after Winterkorn.At 1.8 percent, the VW brand’s first-quarter profit margin lagged a margin target of at least 6 percent because of fixed costs that it says are high relative to Japan’s Toyota.The VW brand’s 2013 profit margin was 2.9 percent, compared with auto division margins of 8.8 percent at Toyota and 9.5 percent at Hyundai Motor Co of Korea.“Costs are slowly beginning to run out of control,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Centre of Automotive think-tank near Cologne. “Inefficiencies are growing, that cannot be entirely avoided at a company as big as VW.”To boost efficiency across its whole 310-model empire, Winterkorn has urged “painful action�� such as ceasing to make low-profit cars, reining in costs of R&amp;D as well as new factories, speeding up model launches and catering more to the needs of foreign markets.“It’s not just the world outside that is putting us to the test,�� the CEO told managers on July 14. “We have taken a critical look at ourselves and found that we’re also dealing with home-made problems.��	-4.471238382
(Reuters) - Toyota’s Elfyn Evans was one stage away from victory in Rally Sweden after doubling his lead over world champion Ott Tanak in Saturday’s second leg.Sunday has only one, 21.19km, Power Stage remaining with the rally shortened due to an unusually mild winter and a lack of snow.Evans, in only his second rally for Toyota after switching from M-Sport Ford for this season, started the day 8.5 seconds ahead of Hyundai’s Tanak.He ended the leg with a 17.2 sec advantage after winning three of the four stages.“Hopefully we can find the same rhythm as the last two days,�� said the Welshman of Sunday’s final stage.“We need to hit the nail on the head, it’s a long stage and you can easily lose a lot of time if you don’t gel with the conditions.”Toyota team mate Sebastien Ogier was third, moving up from fourth but 28.8 sec off the pace, with Hyundai’s championship leader Thierry Neuville in sixth after winning the last stage of the day.	-14.70081791
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is taking an unprecedented route to meet China's stringent green car quotas: its showrooms will sell an electric vehicle without the Japanese company's distinctive triple-oval logo.Instead, it will feature the label of GAC Motor 601238.SS, Toyota's Chinese partner, and will be built around GAC's lower-cost technology. The move - a first for Toyota - will give GAC access to the Japanese carmaker’s stringent quality control, prestige and sales channel. For Toyota, it presents a quick way to meet Beijing’s requirements that such vehicles represent 10 percent of an auto manufacturer’s production by 2019.According to two company executives familiar with the matter, Toyota plans to start selling the GAC Toyota ix4 by the end of the year. The car is a battery-powered compact SUV based on GAC’s Trumpchi GS4, and has been in development for two years.Selling a car derived from a Chinese partner’s vehicle would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But the idea gained momentum at Toyota because of the Chinese government’s push to get more electric vehicles on the road, the executives said.The government mandates have spurred other new alliances, such as Ford Motor Co's F.N agreement to develop electric vehicles with Zotye Automobile Co 000980.SZ. Ford is waiting for regulatory approval for its partnership, which calls for designing and manufacturing several jointly developed no-frills EVs and selling them through a new China-only brand.It wasn’t immediately clear which parts of the ix4 Toyota would provide, or which company’s design standards were used. Quality experts say GAC cars rate relatively high.According to Jeff Cai, a Beijing-based senior director at JD Power &amp; Associates, some of GAC’s cars, such as the Trumpchi GS8 crossover SUV, already stack up well head-to-head with vehicles marketed by global automakers.“The GS4 is a good car with acceptable quality,�� Cai said. He added that the GS4 ranked No. 1 among Chinese brands and No. 3 among all brands for initial quality in the compact SUV category.One question, however, is GAC cars�� longer-term reliability and dependability, Cai said.Under the new Chinese regulations taking effect next year, carmakers must amass credits for so-called new-energy vehicles equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales by 2019. That level rises to 12 percent for 2020. New-energy vehicles are defined as all-electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid cars.Although the ix4 gives Toyota a cheaper and quicker way to meet the quota, it also shows the company’s anxiety about getting a toehold in the Chinese EV market before its own all-battery vehicle is available in 2020, industry officials and experts said.“It’s a creative solution to a critical issue all automakers face in China: how to meet the strict production quotas for electric cars,�� said James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific head of consultancy IHS Markit.Until recently, Toyota was one of the industry’s major hold-outs against full electrification. The company had planned to more or less skip battery-powered cars and turn instead to hydrogen fuel-cell technology as a mainstream alternative to gasoline-fueled cars.But China’s seemingly inexorable drive toward electric cars changed that attitude.At the Beijing auto show last month, Toyota unveiled plug-in electric hybrid versions of its Corolla and Levin, due to go on sale in 2019. The company is also developing an all-electric battery car of its own, which the company has said should hit the market in 2020.“All this means our partnership has entered a new phase,�� the second Toyota executive said.The GAC-Toyota joint venture, established in 2004, has always produced and sold Toyota vehicles modified to sell in China or China-only Toyota cars.To be sure, industry officials and analysts believe GAC Motor cars such as the Trumpchi GS4 have been developed through studying global brands' cars, including those from its partners Toyota and Honda Motor Co 7267.T.Toyota is negotiating to execute a similar EV deal with its second partner, FAW Group [SASACJ.UL], but nothing has been finalised, according to the first Toyota executive.Both executives declined to provide other details, including a target sales volume for the all-electric car or a pricing strategy for it. Toyota will assemble the vehicle at a factory in Guangzhou.The second executive said, however, that Toyota and GAC Motor would have to sell a “fairly sizable number�� of ix4s to help the Toyota-GAC joint venture meet Beijing’s quotas.(This version of the story has been refiled to update editing signoff.)	0.3528374008
* Ford sued by 20 consumers from 14 U.S. states* Complaint claims Ford sold defective vehicles* Suit covers over 30 models made from 2002-2010DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co was sued on Thursday by 20 consumers seeking compensation from the second-largest U.S. automaker for selling vehicles over nearly a decade that they said were vulnerable to unintended acceleration.The lawsuit filed in a West Virginia federal court alleged that more than 30 models equipped with electronic throttle control system did not have in place reliable safety systems, such as a brake override system.The Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars and trucks covered in the lawsuit were built from 2002 to 2010.Among the models were the 2004-2010 Ford F-Series pick-up trucks, the country’s top-selling vehicle, as well as the 2005-2009 Lincoln Town Car and 2002-2005 Mercury Cougar.“They’re trying to be compensated for their economic losses by having overpaid for cars that contained defects,�� Adam Levitt, a partner at Grant &amp; Eisenhofer and head of the law firm’s consumer practice group, said in a phone interview.“Had they and the other class members been aware of these defects, they either wouldn’t have bought the cars or would have paid a lot less for them,�� he added.Concerns over unintended acceleration prompted Toyota Motor Corp to recall more than 10 million cars from 2009 to 2011.In late 2012, Toyota agreed to spend $1.1 billion to settle U.S. class-action litigation over claims that millions of its vehicles has possible safety defects.Ford said studies by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have concluded that driver error is the “predominate�� cause of unintended acceleration events.“NHTSA’s work is far more scientific and trustworthy than work done by personal injury lawyers and their paid experts,�� Ford said in a statement in response to the complaint.“In rare situations, vehicle factors, such as floor mats or broken mechanical components, can interfere with proper throttle operation, and manufacturers have addressed these rare events in field service actions,�� Ford added.Starting in 2010, Ford began installing a brake override system in some of its North American models, according to Thursday’s court filing.The plaintiffs come from 14 U.S. states.Levitt said the law firm is calculating potential monetary damages.The case is Belville et al v. Ford Motor Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of West Virginia, No. 13-11111.	15.13534875
(Repeats story with no changes to text)BERLIN/DETROIT, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Ulrich Hackenberg isn’t yet a household name but if Volkswagen’s $70 billion bet on his big idea pays off, he may join the likes of Henry Ford, Alfred Sloan and Taiichi Ohno in the canon of auto industry pioneers.Since the heyday of Henry Ford and his Model T, the world’s automakers have considered the “global car�� to be their Holy Grail - the same basic design that can be built, in subtle variations, and sold in different markets.Take that fundamental concept, stretch it across many different vehicle types, sizes and brands, then build them by the millions, and you begin to sense the enormity of Volkswagen’s rapidly evolving “mega-platform�� strategy and its potential impact on competitors around the globe.Auto engineer Hackenberg nurtured this bright idea for three decades, after early pitches to auto executives were largely ignored, until somebody finally bought it wholesale. The man who bit was Volkswagen Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn.Hackenberg’s fundamental rethink of vehicle platforms, the industrial Lego from which cars are designed and made, is helping power the German company to the top of the global sales charts several years ahead of its 2018 target. It could also make VW one of the most profitable carmakers in the world.The strategy is not without risk. It could, for instance, expose Volkswagen to the threat of a massive global recall if a single part, used in millions of cars, fails.But rivals have taken note of the power behind its move. Volkswagen’s modular platforms are being benchmarked by most of the world’s top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Ford Motor Co, according to company executives.“We’d be crazy not to,�� said a senior Ford official, requesting anonymity because of the proprietary nature of the subject.VW’s work on its largest mega-platform, known internally as MQB, began in earnest in 2007 and is being implemented over the next four years at a cost of nearly $70 billion, estimates Morgan Stanley. The potential payoff is compelling: Projected annual gross savings by 2019 of $19 billion, according to the bank, with gross margins approaching 10 percent.The automaker is expected to announce a record profit for 2012 of more than $30 billion later this month (Feb. 22), according to Bernstein Research, whose senior analyst, Max Warburton, observes: “VW looks to have unstoppable momentum - in China, the U.S., Europe and most of the rest of the world.”That momentum has been building for some time, even before the initial deployment last year of Hackenberg’s brainchild.Industry-leading levels of commonality - the proportion of parts that can be shared among different models - are nothing new to VW. At a gathering in Japan five years ago, Renault and Nissan executives lifted the hoods on several VW Group vehicles side by side - including models from Skoda, Seat and Audi brands - and saw trouble.“They had the same engines, the same clutches, the same ventilation - all identical parts,�� says an executive who attended the presentation. “It was a level of commonality that didn’t exist at Renault-Nissan.”Late in 2011, as the outlook darkened for French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen, its board was given a similar demonstration, and a similar shock, at the company’s high-security research center in Velizy, southwest of Paris. Technicians took apart the front ends of two different VW cars and swapped most of their components.“They were a little dumbstruck by the realization that there was a whole new world out there - and their development was 10 years behind,�� recalls one participant.After a six-year gestation, VW has just begun to implement its sophisticated and highly flexible platform with the deceptively simple label MQB, a German acronym for “modular transverse matrix.�� Virtually all of the group’s small and medium front-wheel-drive family models, including the latest generations of the VW Golf and Audi A3, are being designed around MQB as their base.The new platform features a far greater degree of plug-and-play modularity, flexibility and parts commonality than at Toyota, General Motors Co, Ford and other competitors.MQB “could be the single most important automotive initiative of the past 25 years,�� says Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Consulting in Northville, Michigan. “It really changes the game.”With the new mega-platform strategy supporting its 12 brands, from spartan Skoda to Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, VW is poised to snatch the global sales crown from Toyota as early as next year, according to investment bank Morgan Stanley.VW envisions enormous leverage from MQB. The plan is to boost global sales to 10 million or more, with roughly two out of every three cars - some 40-plus models totaling 6.3 million sales a year - built on some variation of the MQB platform, according to U.S. research firm IHS Automotive.None of VW’s competitors has the diversity of brands, the breadth of technology, the sweeping geographic footprint or the deep pockets necessary to support and take advantage of such a wide-reaching initiative as MQB.Even Toyota, the current global sales leader, is playing catch-up with its German rival.“There’s no doubt we have fallen behind,�� says a senior Toyota executive who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the subject. “We have not even begun to make the fundamental structural changes that VW has�� in designing and applying flexible vehicle platforms.The sense from competitors and auto analysts is that VW’s rollout of MQB is likely to be as influential as such earlier innovations as Ford’s adaptation of standardized parts, GM’s “ladder�� of brands and Toyota’s streamlined production system.VW’s suppliers see MQB as a watershed event, a break with a past when really big vehicle platforms might have yielded orders for as many as 5 million or 6 million identical components over their typical six- to seven-year life cycle.Now, with the implementation of MQB, “they’re being asked for quotes on 35 million parts,�� says a senior European industry executive.More importantly, the modularity enables VW to design, engineer and build a wide variety of vehicle size and shapes - from a subcompact Polo hatchback to a full-size, seven-passenger crossover that’s due in the United States in 2015.The flexibility of the MQB system also allows VW to create more cars that are more tailored for specific markets at a lower cost, and it doesn’t have to sell so many units to break even, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Stuart Pearson.MQB isn’t the only weapon in Hackenberg’s arsenal.Larger Audi, VW and Porsche models with longitudinal engines - mounted in a north-south configuration - will use a similar set of components dubbed MLB that already underpins a number of Audi vehicles.And many of the group’s ultra-luxury and performance brands will employ a third component set called MSB, designed for premium rear- and all-wheel-drive vehicles such as the Porsche 911, the Bentley Continental and the Lamborghini Gallardo.Each of the three modular component sets will come in different variations that will enable enormous flexibility in terms of product design, while accommodating a wide range of powertrain options, from gas and diesel engines to electric motors and batteries.“Modular platforms have grown beyond the technology (alone) to become a management tool which helps support the brands�� development. The toolkits help the brands to preserve their character and sharpen their individuality,�� said Hackenberg, now development chief for the Volkswagen brand.The modular tool kits seem like the ideal complement to VW’s other strengths, not the least of which is the company’s sheer size: Group revenue this year is projected by Bernstein Research to top $275 billion.But the huge volumes planned for the MQB derivatives alone could also expose the group to the same sort of mass recalls of millions of cars experienced in recent years by Japanese rival Toyota. If a single part has a problem, and that part is in many different models, a recall affects many more vehicles.Analysts, including Morgan Stanley’s Pearson and Frankfurt-based Metzler Bank analyst Juergen Pieper, also express concern about VW’s growing reliance on emerging markets, notably China, for future growth.The company was an early investor in China and the only European automaker to form joint ventures with that country’s top two manufacturers, FAW Group and Shanghai Auto.Now, China accounts for 30 percent of VW’s global sales. The German group operates 10 assembly/component factories in China and plans to pump another $13 billion with its JV partners over the next three years into plants, equipment and models.Excess exposure to a single market such as China contradicts VW’s philosophy of spreading growth evenly and potentially makes it vulnerable to negative market developments and possible government interference, says Pieper.To hedge its potential emerging-markets exposure, VW also has overhauled its loss-making North American operations - an estimated $4-billion investment, according to Morgan Stanley, that could more than double U.S. sales by 2018 to 1.3 million.Even then, it would remain a mid-level player in the U.S. market dominated by GM and Ford, which sell nearly 5 million vehicles a year between them.VW is supporting its recent growth spurt with additional production capacity, including a new Audi assembly plant in Mexico, expansion of VW’s existing facility in Puebla and a potential increase at the new Chattanooga plant in Tennessee.The latter two plants will be updated to accommodate new models that use the MQB platform - the latest Golf in Puebla and the big crossover in Chattanooga, according to VW executives.Top managers are scanning other overseas markets where the company lacks local production facilities, including Africa, much of Latin America and most of the ASEAN region, where VW’s modest presence is dwarfed by that of market leader Toyota.VW is in the process of boosting global capacity, including the investments in China and the United States, to nearly 12 million by 2015, from 8.6 million in 2010, according to Morgan Stanley.The full rollout of MQB may not be accomplished until the end of the decade, estimates Pearson. By then, the chief stewards of VW’s corporate strategy - CEO Winterkorn and Chairman Ferdinand Piech - may be retired and the next generation of management moved into the top slots.The Austrian-born Piech, 75, is a third-generation auto executive. A mechanical engineer by training, he is the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, the legendary Austrian designer of the original VW Beetle.VW’s supervisory board has yet to clearly anoint potential heirs to Piech and Winterkorn, 65, and it will not be easy, particularly since much of the power has been closely held by the two patriarchs since Winterkorn became CEO in 2007.As for the company’s strategic vision after Piech steps down, Morgan Stanley’s Pearson says: “His legacy is (building) the world’s largest and most successful auto company. I don’t think the strategy will change any time soon.�� (Reporting By Laurence Frost in Paris, Andreas Cremer in Berlin, Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Claudia Parsons)	-1.23056377
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers.The proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers.Attorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle.Toyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles.“We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,�� Toyota said in a statement.Under the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement.The settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years.Toyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys�� fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.	10.10019682
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it was recalling about 124,050 Avalon large sedans globally, with most in the United States, to fix an electrical issue that may cause the front airbags to inadvertently deploy.The Japanese automaker said late on Thursday the 2003 and 2004 model-year cars are being recalled because certain circuits in the airbag control module may be damaged by exposure to electrical noise from other electrical components. In addition to the airbags, the seatbelt pretensioners could inadvertently deploy as well.A Toyota spokeswoman said there was one report of a minor injury, but no accidents or fatalities.Dealers will address the issue by adding an electrical noise filter to the airbag control module, Toyota said.About 119,000 of the cars, built at the company’s plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, were sold in the United States, about 4,000 in the Middle East, about 1,000 in Canada and another 50 in China, a spokeswoman said.Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified of the recall by mail, Toyota said.	-5.163861825
* February sales climb 2.4 pct to 105,693 vehicles* Chrysler Canada takes sales lead with 18,522 vehicles* Truck sales climb 9.7 pct as car sales fall 7.3 pctTORONTO, March 3 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales chugged 2.4 percent higher in February as record-setting truck sales helped offset slumping demand for cars and severe winter weather, an independent auto industry analyst said on Monday.Auto sales in the country climbed to 105,693 vehicles, marking the third-best February since 2007 and signaling a “steady as she goes�� sector recovery, said Dennis DesRosiers, of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.Truck sales accelerated to 64,579 vehicles in February, from 58,867 last year, while car sales fell to 41,114 vehicles, from 44,359, he wrote.“Trucks overall continued to grow their sales with a 9.7 percent increase in February. Passenger cars, on the other hand, saw a 7.3 percent decline in unit sales during the month,�� he wrote.“Chrysler continued to build on its market lead, selling ... more than 2,000 units ahead of second placed Ford.”Chrysler Canada, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , posted a 10 percent jump in monthly sales to 18,522 vehicles, marking its fifty-first consecutive month of year-over-year growth.Truck sales soared 16.5 percent to 16,352 vehicles, with record volumes for the Ram pickup, Jeep Wrangler and Chrysler Town &amp; Country van, the company said, while car sales slumped 22 percent to 2,170 vehicles.Ford Motor Co of Canada said sales slipped 0.4 percent in February to 16,234 vehicles from 16,301 in the same period last year, as growing demand for trucks failed to outweigh the sharp drop in car sales.Truck sales grew 4.3 percent to 13,094 vehicles, driven by an 8 percent jump in F-Series sales, but car sales tumbled 16.1 percent to 3,140 vehicles in February.Monthly sales at General Motors Canada tumbled 7.2 percent, the company said, to 12,981 vehicles. Truck sales declined nearly 4 percent as car sales fell 13.7 percent.Toyota Canada Inc said monthly sales rose 1.5 percent, to 10,942 vehicles, with year-to-date sales up 5.8 percent over the same period in 2013.Toyota-branded vehicle sales edged up 0.5 percent, to 9,763, buoyed by a second straight month of record truck sales, the company said.Sales of Lexus-branded vehicles rose 20 percent, to a new February record of 980, while Scion-branded sales fell 19 percent, to 199 for the month.In the United States, auto sales in February were slightly brisker than expected as hefty incentives lured customers into dealerships late in the month despite cold and snowy weather, raising concerns about industry profitability.General Motors Co said it expected industry-wide U.S. auto sales of 15.4 million vehicles in February on an annualized basis, matching a forecast of analysts polled by Reuters.The frost on sales for January and February will thaw in March as temperatures rise and customers return to showrooms in greater numbers, some industry analysts said. However, late February’s high customer incentives, the discounts to lure buyers into showrooms, will carry over into March, cutting in to companies�� profit, they said.In January, four of the top five U.S. auto sellers blamed tough winter weather for disappointing sales.Weather also hurt Canadian auto sales last month, which nudged just 0.3 percent higher. Total sales rose to 95,639 vehicles in January, as a 4.7 percent increase in truck sales offset a 5.9 percent drop in passenger car sales.	-2.039753494
DETROIT, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s best-selling 2013 Camry received a “poor�� crash-test rating on Thursday from an insurance industry group that awarded high marks to Honda Motor Co’s redesigned Accord sedan.The Camry -- the top-selling passenger car in the United States for 14 of the past 15 years -- and the Accord were among a group of 2013-model midsize cars tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a non-profit group funded by the insurance industry.The 2012 Camry, after it was redesigned last year, was named a Top Safety Pick by IIHS. It also received a 5-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as part of the federal safety group’s New Car Assessment Program.IIHS this year has implemented a more stringent frontal crash test, designed to “replicate what happens when the front corner of a car collides with another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole.”It said only two cars -- the 2013 Accord and the 2013 Suzuki Kizashi -- received the top rating of “good�� in the new test. Two cars -- the 2013 Camry and the 2013 Toyota Prius v -- received the lowest rating of “poor.”Eleven cars, including the redesigned 2013 Ford Fusion and 2013 Nissan Altima, were rated “acceptable�� and three cars, including the 2013 Chevrolet Malibu and the 2013 Hyundai Sonata, were rated “marginal.”�Toyota engineers have a lot of work to do to match the performance of their competitors,�� IIHS said in a statement released Thursday with the latest crash-test results.Toyota spokesman Mike Michels said the automaker “will respond to the challenge.”�We are evaluating the new test protocols and can say that there will not be one single solution to achieve greater crash performance in this area,�� Michels said.Through November, Camry’s U.S. sales totaled 373,479, up 36 percent from the previous year, while Accord sales totaled 302,444, up 39 percent.	2.375040484
ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE is holding talks with officials in Ankara over Turkey's vehicle tax regime as it seeks to conclude a 1-billion euro investment to build a production plant in Turkey, two sources said on Thursday.The company said last month that no decision had yet been reached on the location of a new multi-brand plant, but the sources familiar with the talks said Volkswagen is positive about investing in Turkey and was close to taking the step.The sources did not say what assurances Volkswagen is seeking on vehicle tax. Car purchases in Turkey incur a special consumption tax which ranges from 45% to 60% for engines up to 1.6 liters and rises to 100%-110% for engines up to 2 liters.“Volkswagen is largely ready to invest a billion euros into Turkey,�� one of the sources said.“The only standing request VW has is on taxation on the vehicle market,�� the source added, saying Turkey was trying to find a formula that would address Volkswagen concerns without putting existing car producers at a disadvantage.Major producers such as Fiat FCHA.MI, Renault RENA.PA, Ford F.N, Hyundai 005380.KS and Toyota 7203.T produced more than 1.3 million motor vehicles in Turkey last year.The steep Turkish taxes on larger cars limit most buyers and local producers to smaller engine sizes. Cars with engines of less than 1.6 liters made up 96% of Turkey’s new car market in 2018.Volkswagen had also been looking at the new production plant in Bulgaria, but the sources said it was now close to finalizing the deal with Turkey.“There is only one issue left and that is the taxation system,�� the second source said, adding that the differences could be overcome.“Even if it is not implemented immediately, a pledge for change (in the tax system) at a specific date in the future would be enough. They are planning to convey this request to the Turkish president. A final decision will materialize shortly.��	2.954910817
* Sees sales falling to 1.2 mln vehicles this year* Compares with record 1.43 mln in 2012* Cites ending of first-time buyer subsidies* Toyota Thai sales seen down 3.1 pct to 500,000 units* Says to invest 12 bln baht in new plant this year (Adds details)BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Thai automotive industry sales look set to drop 16 percent in 2013, retreating from a record 2012 boosted by government subsidies, Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Monday.The group said it expected sales to decline to 1.2 million vehicles this year, after an 80 percent surge in 2012 fuelled by government subsidies for buyers of first cars.Industry sales had jumped to a record 1.43 million vehicles in 2012, also boosted by pent-up demand after severe flooding in late 2011, Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Motor Thai unit, told a news conference.“Thai auto sales this year will not fall much from last year. We think the economy will still be good, but there is no first-car scheme this year,�� he said.For Toyota itself, 2013 sales are set to fall 3.1 percent to 500,000 units, giving it a 40 percent market share, with sales of passenger cars down 11 percent. It aims for exports of 412,000 vehicles worth 168 billion baht this year, plus 70 billion baht of auto parts.In 2012, its auto sales jumped 78 percent to 516,086 vehicles, with passenger cars up 62.8 percent.Toyota plans to invest 12 billion baht ($404 million) in the southeast Asian country to build a second plant at the Gateway industrial park to produce environmentally friendly cars as well as vehicles for export, Tanada said.The plant is expected to be completed in the middle of this year, which will help boost the firm’s capacity at Gateway to 300,000 units per year from 220,000.Vice Chairman Ninnart Chaithirapinyo said risks to exports included a stronger baht, caused by capital inflows, and economic problems in the United States and Europe.Thailand’s daily minimum wage rose to 300 baht ($10) this month and Tanada said the company would have to increase productivity by measures such as increased automation to help reduce costs.The daily minimum wage rose by an average 25.5 percent from Jan. 1, depending on the region, on top of a 40 percent nationwide increase last April.

TORONTO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Canada’s largest private-sector union said on Wednesday it plans to hold an organization vote for about 7,000 workers at two Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada Inc assembly plants in Ontario early this year.More than 40 percent of employees at the Toyota plants, in Woodstock and Cambridge, Ontario, have signed union cards, a legal requirement before a certification vote can be held, John Aman, head of organizing for the union, Unifor, said.Unifor, formed in last year’s merger of the Canadian Auto Workers and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers union, dedicates 10 percent of its revenue to such union drives and has made Toyota a priority, Aman said.A Toyota Motor Canada spokesman said the company was unaware of the timing of any such vote.The CAW had to withdraw a certification application for Toyota from the Ontario Labour Relations Board in 2001 because the requisite 40 percent of a proposed bargaining unit had not signed union cards, Aman said. The International Association of Machinists also withdrew a Toyota unionization bid in 2008 due to inadequate support.Unifor represents workers at Canadian plants operated by Ford Motor Co, Chrysler and General Motors Co .Unifor is “very comfortable�� with its support at Toyota, Aman said, but he would not specify when the union will hold the certification vote, beyond saying early in 2014.Key issues that concern workers include being hired on temporary contracts, which have reduced benefits and don’t allow participation in the company’s pension plan, Aman said.He said the pension plan itself is also an issue after the company said last year it would put new permanent hires on a defined contribution plan, versus a defined benefit plan.Toyota, which began assembling vehicles in Canada in 1988, has never laid off an employee, Toyota Motor Canada spokesman Greig Mordue said.“First, people are hired on contract basis and only when we can make a long-term commitment to them, in terms of their employment security, do we transition them into permanent status,�� he said.“Over the past 12 months or so we’ve hired 1,000 new team members and we’ve also made 900 contracts permanent,�� Mordue said.Unifor, which launched its latest Toyota union drive about 15 months ago, will next increase its efforts at Honda Motor Co Ltd’s Alliston, Ontario, assembly plant, where it began a campaign some five months ago, Aman said.	-2.73414776
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T plans to make and sell hybrid versions of its Corolla and Levin sedans in China next year, fitting them with locally-made components, in its first bid to entirely manufacture gas-electric hybrids outside Japan.The backdrop to Toyota’s plans are efforts by foreign and domestic automakers to kick-start sales of hybrid cars in China, as the world’s largest auto market warms to the vehicles in its efforts to cut pollution and reliance on fossil fuels.Toyota, an industry leader in hybrid vehicles, already makes the Prius and Camry hybrids in China, but has to import key parts, such as hybrid systems, making it tough to generate volume due to high import tariffs.In 2015, the Corolla and Levin hybrid sedans will carry made-in-China batteries, hybrid transaxles and inverters, Executive Vice President Yasumori Ihara, said at the Auto China car show in Beijing on Sunday.Ihara, who oversees Toyota’s emerging markets business, also said the world’s largest carmaker aimed to double auto sales in China to around 2 million vehicles a year, but gave no time frame for the target.Toyota, playing catchup to rivals such as Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, General Motors GM.N, Hyundai and Nissan Motor Co. 7201.T in China, aims to become the third best-selling carmaker in China and surpass Nissan in the future, he said.To do so, Toyota will introduce 15 new models in the country by end-2017, he said. China now accounts for about 10 percent of Toyota’s global sales.In 2013, Toyota sold 917,000 vehicles in China, up 9 percent from a year earlier, recovering from a sales plunge after September 2012 due to a diplomatic row between Japan and China over a set of isles. Its market share was at around 5 percent.It sold around 20,400 hybrid vehicles in China in 2013, up from just 7,900 in 2012.If Toyota hits its sales target of 1.1 million vehicles or more this year, it would be meeting the objective of selling 1 million vehicles a year in China four years later than initially planned.Toyota runs joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group 601238.SS2238.HK.	-0.8928571429
* Toyota to replace air bag inflators on cars recalled earlier* Decision prompted after airbag in Nissan car ruptures* Nissan has also reissued recalls to replace the Takata part (Adds comment from Toyota, details, changes media slug from TOYOTA-RECALL/AIRBAGS )TOKYO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday said it would replace Takata Corp airbag inflators in 1.6 million cars in Japan that had previously been recalled after concluding that they may still be unsafe.The decision was prompted after a passenger in a Nissan Motor Co vehicle was injured this year when an airbag ruptured, despite the inflator having been checked in an earlier inspection.Nissan this month reissued recalls for around 310,000 vehicles in Japan due to the incident.In earlier inspections, automakers had checked the inflators using ammonium nitrate for air leaks and deemed some safe enough not to be replaced. But Toyota said in emailed comments that it would now replace all of those inflators. The replacement parts will be made by Takata.The recall affects around 20 domestic models produced between 2004 and 2008, including the Vitz compact. The initial recalls were conducted in May and June.Information on how this may affect recalls outside Japan was not immediately available.U.S. regulators have linked Takata inflators using ammonium nitrate, which can explode upon deployment and spray shrapnel, to eight deaths, triggering the recall of tens of millions of vehicles worldwide.This month, Toyota, Nissan and other major car manufacturers said they would stop using ammonium nitrate inflators manufactured by Takata in new models. Takata says it has yet to determine the root cause of the defect.The embattled airbag maker was fined $70 million by U.S. regulators, which also ordered the company to stop using the potentially dangerous propellant.	0.08040524242
* Takata says more vehicles could be recalled* Discovers record-keeping errors at plant in Mexico* Honda, Nissan, Mazda check for problem* 7 million cars with Takata air bags recalled in last 5 years* U.S. safety regulators open probe (Adds Takata, Chrysler comments in paragraphs 5 and 16)By Yoko Kubota and Ben KlaymanTOKYO/DETROIT, June 11 (Reuters) - Takata Corp’s safety crisis deepened on Wednesday after Toyota Motor Corp recalled almost 2.3 million vehicles globally, many for the second time, and the Japanese air bag maker warned that further fixes may be needed.Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, called back 1.62 million vehicles outside of Japan that it recalled last year as well as 650,000 more in Japan not previously recalled. The additional vehicles brought to more than 7 million the total number of cars equipped with Takata air bags to be called back worldwide over the last five years.The 2.3 million cars, many of them sold in the United States, are being recalled to replace faulty air bag inflators.Also on Wednesday, U.S. safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into vehicles equipped with Takata air bags.Takata, the world’s No. 2 manufacturer of auto safety equipment, said other automakers may have to issue recalls because of problems with tracking potential defects related to air bag inflators that date back over a decade.Toyota expanded its recall because Takata said it had discovered record-keeping errors at a Mexican plant where potentially faulty air bag inflators were made in 2001 and 2002.While Toyota’s recall covers passenger side air bags, NHTSA investigation documents cited reports of both driver and passenger side air bags not working properly or rupturing. Takata said it was cooperating with NHTSA’s probe but declined to comment further.Toyota’s expanded recall comes at a time when General Motors Co is under intense scrutiny over why it took more than a decade to discover a defective ignition switch linked to at least 13 deaths.In 2013, carmakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co , Nissan Motor Co and BMW recalled about 3.6 million vehicles because of flaws in Takata air bag inflators that could cause them to explode in an accident.Takata did not disclose how much it expected Wednesday’s Toyota recall to cost, but last year’s recall cost the Tokyo-based auto supplier $300 million. The company’s shares were down more than 4 percent when the Tokyo market closed.Previously, Takata told U.S. safety regulators it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of the explosive propellants used to inflate air bags. It also kept inadequate quality-control records, making it impossible to identify vehicles with potentially defective inflators.The Takata-related recall in 2013 was the largest air bag-related recall in history and came after a series of recalls, accidents and at least two deaths alleged to have been caused by faulty air bags.Toyota said on Wednesday it was expanding its April 2013 recall involving 2.14 million vehicles manufactured between 2000 and 2004. The serial numbers Takata provided for potentially flawed inflators had been incomplete, Toyota said.In an unusual step, Toyota said it would also instruct dealers in the United States and other overseas markets to begin replacing suspect Takata inflators in all vehicles covered in a recall announced last year. Previously, the automaker had asked dealers only to replace inflators that were defective.“We have judged that it is more certain to replace everything,�� Toyota spokesman Naoki Sumino said.More than 766,000 Toyota vehicles were affected in last year’s recall in the United States.NHTSA said it has opened a probe into an estimated 1,092,000 vehicles made by not only Toyota, but also Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Fiat SpA’s Chrysler Group after receiving six reports of air bags not deploying properly in the humid climates of Florida and Puerto Rico.Honda, Nissan and Mazda said they were investigating whether they needed to recall more vehicles due to problems tracking faulty Takata parts. BMW said it was not aware of any impact on its vehicles. Chrysler said its engineers were analyzing the issue and that the automaker is cooperating with NHTSA’s probe.In January, Takata began investigating whether there were other vehicles with potentially faulty inflators not covered by the previous recalls after being contacted by Toyota, Takata spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa said.Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the automaker had been notified of one case in which a defective front passenger-side air bag inflator caused a seat cover to burn and two cases where the inflator ruptured when the air bag deployed.Toyota vehicles covered by the recall include Corolla and Camry sedans, and Tundra trucks.The inflators under investigation were manufactured between September 2001 and September 2002 at Takata’s Mexico plant, the company said. Some of the explosive wafers used in the air bag inflator may have been exposed to excessive moisture or pressed into shape with too little force.That could cause the inflator to explode when the air bag is deployed, potentially sending pieces of shrapnel into the vehicle, the previous investigation found.It was not immediately clear how many Takata air bag inflators could have defects. Takata said it will supply the replacement inflators in the Toyota recall.	4.148433398
DETROIT, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators said on Monday they have opened a preliminary evaluation into consumer complaints that front airbags on the best-selling Honda Odyssey minivan deploy unexpectedly.The investigation could result in a recall for some 320,000 Odysseys from the 2003 and 2004 model years in the United States manufactured by Honda Motor Co.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it received six consumer complaints about improper airbag deployment in Odyssey minivans, three of which resulted in injuries.All six of the drivers who complained to NHTSA said the Odysseys were on the road, either while in motion or at start-up, when the airbag deployed without the vehicle being involved in a crash.Also, NHTSA said it has received 41 consumer complaints that the air bag warning light was illuminated.NHTSA said that it was alerted to possible problems with the airbags in the Odyssey by a supplier that made similar airbags for Chrysler products that were recalled.In the first five months of 2013, Odyssey was the top-selling minivan in the United States, with 25 percent of the minivan market, followed closely by the Toyota Motor Corp Sienna at 24.3 percent, the Dodge Caravan at 23.5 percent and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country at 23.3 percent.Dodge and Chrysler are both brands of the Chrysler Group LLC, which is majority owned by Fiat.A Honda spokesman said the company would cooperate with NHTSA investigators.	7.813542362
DETROIT, March 4 (Reuters) - EcoMotors, a Michigan-based engine maker backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, has formed a joint venture in China with a subsidiary of First Auto Works.The FAW subsidiary, First Auto Works Jingye Engine Company, is investing more than $200 million in the venture, BEM (Shanxi) Co, which aims to begin building an advanced engine designed by EcoMotors in 2015 in China’s Shanxi province.FAW’s manufacturing partners in China include Volkswagen AG , Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors Co .It is the second China venture for EcoMotors, a suburban Detroit startup, which announced a similar deal last April with China’s Zhongding Power. The privately held Chinese firm plans to ramp up production this year in Anhui province, supplying engines for use in commercial and off-road vehicles.Both China ventures will build EcoMotors�� OPOC engine, which is more compact than conventional gas and diesel engines of similar power. It is also said to be cheaper and to deliver higher fuel economy and fewer emissions.Braemer Energy Ventures is also an investor in EcoMotors, which was founded in 2008.

Jones posts first Xfinity victory at TexasFORT WORTH, Texas -- Teenager Erik Jones turned his first NASCAR Xfinity Series pole at Texas Motor Speedway into his first series victory Friday night, schooling NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stars Brad Keselowski and Dale Earnhardt Jr. en route to the checkered flag in the O’Reilly Auto Parts 300.Jones, 18, held off Keselowski on a restart on Lap 175 of the scheduled 200 at the high-banked, 1.5-mile quad-oval for a 1.624-second margin of victory in the first night race of the season.Jones�� first series win came in his ninth start. In the process, Jones became the second-youngest series winner at Texas at 18 years, 10 months, 11 days -- a record set last year by Chase Elliott at 18 years, 4 months, 7 days when he posted his first series victory in this event.“This is surreal. That confidence is something I never doubted in myself,�� said Jones, who shared the Victory Lane celebration with crew chief Michael Wheeler. “This is just amazing. We beat Cup guys tonight. Just a really cool day and something I’m really proud of not only for myself but everybody at Joe Gibbs Racing. It’s a great feeling knowing you had to work for it, that it was not just handed to you.”Jones previously had competed in the NASCAR Camping World Series. He started fifth and finished 11th in last June’s annual summer night race.Jones took the lead for good on Lap 151 from Earnhardt and paced the final 50 circuits. Jones led six times for a race-high 79 laps, 23 more than Keselowski, who started from the rear of the field because of “unapproved adjustments.�� Before taking the lead, Jones ran up to the back of Earnhardt’s rear bumper and gave him a warning tap.“That was fun and frustrating,�� Jones said. “I knew what he was doing. It was hard racing, two drivers giving 100 percent. I learned a lot from him. He definitely raced us hard and we raced him hard. At the end of the day, we got to race against Dale Earnhardt Jr., a guy I’ve watched forever on TV. He’s a great race car driver and has a great team and to beat him is really, really cool. Man, what a battle. It was fun for me and I hope just as much fun to watch.”Keselowski, meanwhile, sounded the horn for NASCAR’s latest youth movement.“Erik had a great camp and did a great job,�� Keselowski said. “We raced side-by-side for about two laps but eventually he cleared me, so that was good racing.“It was good side-by-side racing and we ran wide-open there, and that’s always cool when you’re running wide open and side by side. It was a matter of who was going to lift first and nobody lifted. We came up a bit short. We were pretty strong at times ... got a little damage on that last pit stop cycle, but who knows? Just up and down and barely missed it at the end.”Keselowski overtook Earnhardt on Lap 167. Keselowski’s last best shot to beat Jones was set up after series veteran Brendan Gaughan and Cale Conley crashed exiting Turn 2 after Conley’s car blew a right front tire. But Jones held his ground on the restart against Keselowski, the 2012 NSCS champion.Earlier Friday, Jones qualified on-pole at 185.166 mph. The race, slowed by five cautions, took 2:15:21. Jones�� winning average speed was 132.989 mph.NASCAR XFINITY Series Race - O’Reilly Auto Parts 300Texas Motor SpeedwayFort Worth, TexasFriday, April 10, 20151.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T four-year run as the world's top-selling automaker has ended as the Japanese company said on Monday its global sales for 2016 fell short of Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE.Toyota said global sales across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu minicar and Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T truck brands rose 0.2 percent to 10.18 million last year from 2015. This was less than the 10.3 million sold by Volkswagen, which posted record high global sales despite its diesel emissions scandal.Toyota’s overall global sales were supported by a 5.5 percent rise in domestic sales for the Toyota brand following new launches for models including the Prius, while overseas sales slipped 0.6 percent as demand eased in North America, in and around the Middle East and Africa.Toyota, which had been the world’s top-selling automaker on an annual basis since 2012, estimates global sales to increase to around 10.23 million vehicles in 2017.	-1.145860257

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deepening uncertainties over the direction and timetable of Brexit negotiations may force Toyota 7203.T to shift some UK production elsewhere if they are not addressed, the Japanese carmaker warned on Tuesday.Early government assurances that free trade with the European Union would survive Britain’s departure have been replaced by talk of transition periods, Toyota Executive Vice President Didier Leroy told Reuters.“A few months ago the UK government was saying, ‘We’re sure we’ll be able to negotiate (a deal) without any trade tax,’� Leroy said in an interview at the Frankfurt car show. “They are not saying that any more.”He added: “It’s clear that if we have to wait two to three more years to have a clarity on this topic, we will have a big question-mark about our future investment in the country.”Brexit talks have become bogged down in recent weeks, with the EU’s chief negotiator saying not enough progress had been made to begin discussing a free trade deal, amid differences over the size of the “divorce settlement�� London should pay.Britain’s car industry is increasingly anxious that its exports could face tariffs and other barriers after 2019.PSA Group PEUP.PA boss Carlos Tavares sounded an impatient note on Tuesday, saying Brexit uncertainties were complicating integration with Opel and its British Vauxhall plants, acquired by the Peugeot maker from General Motors GM.N.“Until we have more visibility on the trade dimension it’s very hard to define a strategy,�� Tavares said in Frankfurt.Jaguar Land Rover TAMO.NS, Britain's biggest automaker, also warned last week that Brexit was already deterring EU workers and suppliers. Toyota announced plans in March to begin upgrading its Burnaston plant in central England in preparation for future models at a cost of 240 million pounds ($318 million), after receiving written assurances from London.But Leroy, Toyota’s top foreign executive, said the company could not wait indefinitely before deciding whether to build a new model at the site after production of the aging Avensis model ends. Burnaston also builds the smaller Auris.“We cannot take this kind of decision before we have clarity on the future trade relationship,�� said Leroy.“We will not close the plant tomorrow morning, but if in two to three years we have to decide some future investments, of course the key point will be the competitiveness of this plant in future.”Leroy declined to say how much of the upgrade funds had already been spent, stressing that considerably larger sums would be needed to launch production of any new vehicles.Without further investment, Burnaston’s output “will probably start to decline before we will be able to take a decision,�� Leroy said. “The longer we have to wait, the more potential there is to move to another factory.”He added: “We will not postpone a new product for three more years just because the negotiation is going to take three more years. So really there’s a strong need for us to have clarity as quickly as possible.��(This version of the story was refiled to fix Reuters Instrument Code in first paragraph)	5.805677043

(Reuters) - Champions Audi seized the top three grid spots for the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race on Thursday with Frenchman Loic Duval securing pole position for the number two car shared with Denmark’s Tom Kristensen and Britain’s Allan McNish.The lockout by the three diesel hybrid factory cars was Audi’s first since 2002 at the Sarthe circuit.Duval’s best time of three minutes 22.349 seconds was set in Wednesday night’s first session with changeable weather and red flag interruptions thwarting others�� efforts to go faster on Thursday.The number one Audi R18 e-tron shared by Andre Lotterer, Marcel Fassler and Benoit Treluyer - winners for the last two years - will start in second place with the number three car of Oliver Jarvis, Lucas Di Grassi and Marc Gene in third.Toyota, Audi’s main rivals for victory on the 90th anniversary of the endurance classic, which is in its 81st edition, qualified fourth and fifth but threaten to be stronger in the race.Kristensen is chasing his ninth Le Mans win while McNish is a double winner.Audi, who also started on pole last year, have won the race for the last three years and 10 times in the last 13. The start is on Saturday.	8.992053534
NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of foreign companies rose on Tuesday, boosted by hopes negotiations in the “fiscal cliff�� talks were beginning to inch forward.A deal to avert the “fiscal cliff�� - a series of tax hikes and spending cuts that could send the U.S. economy into recession - looked closer after House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner kept the support of his Republican colleagues for compromises in talks with President Barack Obama.The BNY Mellon index of leading American depositary receipts gained 1 percent, while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index rose 1.1 percent and was on track for its best two-day performance in a month.Nokia Corp climbed 4.6 percent to $4.13 in New York trade, buoyed by growing expectations of strong sales of the company’s new Lumia smart phone models.The BNY Mellon index of leading European ADRs gained 0.8 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed up 0.4 percentThe BNY Mellon index of leading Asian ADRs advanced 1.5 percent, as the Nikkei average neared the 10,000 mark and remained at an 10-week high on expectations of an aggressive monetary easing policy in the wake of recent elections.The anticipation of an easing policy helped move lift shares of exporters, with Canon Inc up 4.4 percent to $39.42, Honda Motor Co up 2.4 percent to $34.79 and Toyota Motor Corp up 3 percent to $89.18.Toyota also rose after the Nikkei reported the automaker will keep its global output target for 2013 nearly unchanged from this year at 9.9 million vehicles despite a production cut at home.The BNY Mellon index of leading Latin American ADRs advanced 0.9 percent.	5.663911846
(Adds Honda, Hyundai sales, plus industry total)DETROIT, May 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry in April rebounded sharply from a bitter and extended winter, with car sales rising 8 percent from the previous year.Six of the top seven automakers reported year-to-year sales gains on Thursday, but only four topped analysts�� expectations.The industry delivered 1.39 million cars in April, up 8 percent from the previous year, according to research firm Autodata Corp.Tapping consumer demand that began to increase as the bad weather broke in late March, General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co beat expectations, with Toyota and Nissan both posting double-digit increases.Chrysler Group LLC, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , also registered a double-digit sales gain in April, but narrowly missed expectations, as did Ford Motor Co whose April sales slipped 1.0 percent. Honda Motor Co, up 1 percent, also missed.“Sales momentum from March rolled into April, pushing the industry to its best back-to-back monthly sales pace since the fall of 2007,�� said Bill Fay, general manager of Toyota brand.Toyota group sales, including the Lexus and Scion brands, totaled 199,660, up 13 percent. Nissan sales, including Infiniti, were a record 103,934, up 18 percent. Honda sales, including Acura, were 132,456.Chrysler said U.S. auto sales rose 14 percent to 178,652. GM said sales increased 7.0 percent to 254,076. Ford sales fell to 211,126.Combined Hyundai and Kia sales in April climbed 8 percent to 119,783.April was seen as a second strong month in a row, after the cold and snowy weather in January and February dampened car buyers�� enthusiasm.“The economy continues to strengthen,�� said Kurt McNeil, head of GM’s U.S. sales operations. “Retail demand was steady in April, and truck sales and transaction prices were especially strong.”The industry sold cars at an annual rate of 16.04 million in April, according to Autodata. Economists polled earlier by Reuters expected the industry’s annual sales rate in April to come in at 16.2 million vehicles, which would be slightly slower than March.Negative publicity over GM’s recall earlier this year of 2.6 million vehicles linked to 13 deaths does not appear to have had a significant impact on the company’s image or the appeal of its brands to U.S. consumers, said Larry Dominique, executive vice president at industry researcher TrueCar.The GM recall, for which the automaker took a $1.3-billion writedown in the first quarter, is “almost a bigger industry story than a consumer story,�� Dominique said.All four of GM’s U.S. brands reported year-to-year increases in April. Chevrolet and Cadillac were each up 5.0 percent, Buick jumped 12 percent, and GMC rose 13 percent.Sales at both the Ford and Lincoln brands declined in April - Ford down 0.3 percent and Lincoln off 11 percent.Sales at Chrysler’s Jeep line, which is to be the primary global brand of a merged Fiat and Chrysler expected later this year, rose 52 percent in April from a year earlier.Jeep U.S. sales of 205,593 in the first four months of the year were 46 percent higher than a year earlier. Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne has set a target of 1 million sales globally for Jeep for the year.Sales of large pickups remained strong in April, driven by hefty discounts from manufacturers and dealers.Chrysler’s Ram truck sales rose 17 percent to 36,674. Ford’s best-selling F-series pickup climbed 7.0 percent to 63,387, the best April tally since 2006. GM’s Chevrolet Silverado jumped 9 percent to 42,755.Two of the best-selling green cars in the country, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, have had mixed results this year, although sales for both picked up in April.The battery-powered Leaf saw sales rise 8 percent to 2,088, with year-to-date sales up 33 percent to 7,272. Sales of the Volt gasoline-electric hybrid were up 19 percent in April to 1,548, but year-to-date sales are off 7 percent to 5,154.Sales among smaller manufacturers were mixed. Volkswagen AG , whose brands include Audi and Porsche, reported sales down 1 percent to 50,556. (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Jeffrey Benkoe, Andrew Hay and Cynthia Osterman)	3.656872555
(Reuters) - Canadian police said on Tuesday they found “several items directly linked�� to two teenage boys charged with killing a university lecturer and suspected in the murders of two tourists.The pair, Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, both of Port Alberni, British Columbia, have been on the run for nearly three weeks with no confirmed sightings since July 22.The evidence, details of which were not revealed, was found on the banks of the Nelson River, 9 km (5.59 miles) along the shore near Gillam, Manitoba, the tiny northern community that was the center of the search last week, before the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) scaled back the manhunt.On Sunday, RCMP sent dive teams into the Nelson River, which is wide, fast-flowing and powers several hydro-electric dams, as part of the search for McLeod and Schmegelsky. That search proved futile.McLeod and Schmegelsky were first reported as missing on July 19 after their Dodge pickup truck was found in flames near Dease Lake, British Columbia, 2 km (1.24 miles) from where a body - later identified as university lecturer Leonard Dyck, 64 - was found.Days later the RCMP said the pair was being considered as suspects in the July 15 murders of Chynna Deese, 24, of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Lucas Fowler, 23, of Sydney, Australia, which took place 500 km (310.69 miles) away from where Dyck was found, near Liard Hot Spring.Schmegelsky and McLeod were charged on July 24 with the murder of Dyck.Northern communities across Canada have since been on edge as sightings of the two teens occurred first in Saskatchewan, and then in Gillam, Manitoba, 3,000 km (1864.11 miles) away from the sites of the murders, where a gray Toyota RAV4 they were known to have been driving was found in flames on a highway just outside of the town.	2.987053502

NAGOYA, March 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp on Wednesday said they planned to produce electric vehicles (EVs) and compact cars for each other to better compete with fast-changing technologies in the global auto industry.The agreement builds on a partnership between the two Japanese companies announced in 2017 under which Toyota is helping Suzuki to develop and market electric cars in India, while Suzuki helps Toyota increase its presence in the fast-growing Indian market.Under the latest agreement, Suzuki will source hybrid systems for cars it sells worldwide from Toyota, which pioneered hybrid vehicles with the Prius more than 20 years ago, the companies said in a joint statement.Suzuki’s hybrid vehicles for the Indian market will be made using engines and batteries locally produced by Toyota. In addition, Toyota will produce electric vehicles based on its RAV4 SUV crossover and Corolla wagon for Suzuki in the European market.In return, Suzuki will produce two compact models for Toyota in India based on its Ciaz and Ertiga models, and supply Toyota with gasoline engines for compact vehicle models sold in Europe.Suzuki will also produce its Baleno, Vitara Brezza, Ciaz, and Ertiga models for Toyota to sell in Africa.	3.088674859

* Canada and Australia pull out and demand postponement* Olympic body and Japan promise decision within month* Athletes worried about disrupted training, health risks* Billions of dollars�� investment, sponsorship, rights at stake* World Athletics willing to move 2021 world championshipsTORONTO/TOKYO, March 23 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee has decided to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games because of the coronavirus pandemic, IOC member Dick Pound said on Monday, as a window slowly began to open that would allow the showcase to be staged next year.Major sporting nations Australia and Canada had already withdrawn on Monday as organisers came under global pressure to postpone the event for the first time in its 124-year modern history.“On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,�� Pound said in newspaper USA Today. “The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.”Pound told Reuters that a one-year postponement looked like the best solution. This would mean the Games, which had been scheduled for July 24-Aug. 9, are likely to be held in the summer of 2021.Japan and the IOC have said calling off the Games entirely is not an option. But finding a new date could be complicated as the summer 2021 calendar is already crowded, while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.Pound said a large number of stakeholders from the organising committee, to athletes to broadcasters and sporting federations would all need to be consulted before a plan could be finalised but there were early signs of a willingness to accommodate a 2021 Summer Games.World Athletics said on Monday they would be willing to move their 2021 world championships scheduled for Aug. 6-15 in Eugene, Oregon to clear a path for a 2021 Olympics.“World Athletics has already been in discussion with the Oregon 21 Organising Committee regarding the possibility the Olympic Games may move to next year and they in turn have held discussions with their key stakeholders and have reassured us they will work with all of their partners and stakeholders to ensure that Oregon is able to host the World Athletics Championships on alternative dates should that prove necessary,�� athletics�� global governing body said in a statement.An Olympics postponement would be a blow for host country Japan, which has pumped in more than $12 billion of investment, and huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters.But a groundswell of concern from athletes - already struggling to train as gyms, stadiums and swimming pools close around the world - appeared to be tipping the balance, along with the cancellation of other major sports events.More than 337,000 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 14,600 have died in a pandemic that the World Health Organisation said was accelerating.The IOC and the Japanese government have both edged back from weeks of insistence that the Games would go ahead, announcing a month-long consultation.‘STRESS AND UNCERTAINTY’The Olympics have never before been delayed, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the two world wars, and major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984 respectively.“The moment the IOC indicates that it is thinking about other solutions, it has already decided to delay the Games,�� said French Olympic Committee president Denis Masseglia.Canada and Australia both bluntly said they would not participate if the Games were not put back to 2021 and Britain may have followed suit.“We are in the midst of a global health crisis that is far more significant than sport,�� Canada’s Olympic Committee and Paralympic Committee said in a statement.A raft of other nations and sports bodies piled pressure on the IOC to make a quick decision.Athletes were sad but broadly supported a delay.“The right choice was made, but it doesn’t make it any easier,�� said Canadian world champion swimmer Maggie MacNeil, who was hoping to make her Olympic debut in Tokyo.“Sometimes you just need a good hug.”Japanese authorities seemed to be bowing to the inevitable, despite the losses and logistics headaches it would entail.“We may have no option but to consider postponing,�� Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending, told parliament.The organising committee is already scaling back the torch relay to avoid crowds, national broadcaster NHK said.Japanese sponsors, from Toyota Motor Corp to Panasonic Corp, were watching nervously. But Tokyo stocks sensitive to the success of the Olympics surged on Monday, after sharp falls in prior weeks, thanks to expectations of a delay rather than a cancellation.Ad agency Dentsu Group’s shares jumped 12%.Pound told Reuters the IOC had tried to hold fire in order to be able to present the hosts, sports federations and sponsors with a clear alternative plan.“Probably what turned the tide in the last couple of days is the curve on the COVID-19 virus. It is getting very, very steep now and this is clearly not something that is going to be under control by June or July and probably not by the end of the year.��	9.297929793
BEIJING, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp could divert shipments from China’s Tianjin port where operations have been indefinitely disrupted after a massive explosion last week, a senior Beijing-based company executive said on Wednesday.Shanghai and Dalian ports should have enough capacity to prevent a severe logistical problem for Toyota in the world’s biggest auto market, the executive said, as global carmakers come to terms with the partial shutdown at China’s main car import terminal.“Port of Tianjin will likely be unusable for a long while, although I have no idea at the moment how long these disruptions would last,�� the official told Reuters, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak with reporters.“There are a lot of unknowns at this time.”A company spokesman in Japan confirmed Toyota was considering rerouting cars to other ports.Huge explosions ripped through Tianjin port on Aug 12, killing at least 114 people. Investigators have not determined the cause of the blasts at the world’s 10th-largest port, the gateway to China’s industrial northeast.It could take at least a couple of months for normal port operations in Tianjin to resume, research firm IHS Automotive said.In addition to Toyota, automakers like Volkswagen AG and BMW said they had made moves to switch to Shanghai and other ports in the aftermath of the explosions.Toyota’s two final assembly plants near the port suspended their operations from Monday to Wednesday, in part to assess the damage from the blasts.Toyota produced 432,340 vehicles at the two plants in Tianjin last year, according to IHS. It estimated a production loss of 2,200 cars per day as a result of the explosions.The port accounts for about 40 percent of China’s imported cars, the research firm said.

KYOTO, Japan (Reuters) - The global push among carmakers to make ever lighter vehicles is leading some auto suppliers in Japan to turn to what seems like an unlikely substitute for steel - wood.Japanese researchers and auto component makers say a material made from wood pulp weighs just one fifth of steel and can be five times stronger.The material - cellulose nanofibers - could become a viable alternative to steel in the decades ahead, they say, although it faces competition from carbon-based materials, and remains a long way from being commercially viable.Reducing the weight of a vehicle will be critical as manufacturers move to bring electric cars into the mainstream. Batteries are an expensive but vital component, so a reduction in car weight will mean fewer batteries will be needed to power the vehicle, saving on costs.“Lightweighting is a constant issue for us,�� said Masanori Matsushiro, a project manager overseeing body design at Toyota Motor Corp.“But we also have to resolve the issue of high manufacturing costs before we see an increased use of new, lighter-weight materials in mass-volume cars.”Researchers at Kyoto University and major parts suppliers such as Denso Corp, Toyota’s biggest supplier, and DaikyoNishikawa Corp, are working with plastics incorporated with cellulose nanofibers - made by breaking down wood pulp fibers into several hundredths of a micron (one thousandth of a millimeter).Cellulose nanofibers have been used in a variety of products ranging from ink to transparent displays, but their potential use in cars has been enabled by the “Kyoto Process��, under which chemically treated wood fibers are kneaded into plastics while simultaneously being broken down into nanofibers, slashing the cost of production to roughly one-fifth that of other processes.“This is the lowest-cost, highest-performance application for cellulose nanofibers, and that’s why we’re focusing on its use in auto and aircraft parts,�� Kyoto University Professor Hiroaki Yano, who is leading the research, told Reuters in an interview.The university, along with auto parts suppliers, are currently developing a prototype car using cellulose nanofiber-based parts to be completed in 2020.“We’ve been using plastics as a replacement for steel, and we’re hoping that cellulose nanofibers will widen the possibilities toward that goal,�� said Yukihiko Ishino, a spokesman at DaikyoNishikawa, which counts Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp among its customers.Automakers are also using other lightweight substitutes. BMW uses carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) for its i3 compact electric car as well as for its 7 series, while high-tensile steel and aluminum alloys are currently the most widely used lightweight options because they are cheaper and recyclable.“SPRUCE GOOSE”Yano said he was inspired in his research by a photo of the “Spruce Goose��, a cargo plane made almost entirely of wood in 1947 by U.S. billionaire entrepreneur Howard Hughes. At the time, it was the world’s largest aircraft.“I thought that if Howard Hughes could find a way to use wood to build a massive plane, why not use wood to make a material that was as strong as steel,�� he said.The cost of mass producing a kilogram of cellulose nanofiber is currently around 1,000 yen ($9).Yano aims to halve that cost by 2030, which he says will make it an economically viable product, since it would be combined with plastic, and so competitive against high tensile steel and aluminum alloys, which currently cost around $2 per kg.Industry experts anticipate that carbon fiber prices will fall to around $10 per kg by 2025.Analysts say high-tensile steel and aluminum will be the more popular alternative for many years to come, considering parts makers would need to overhaul production lines and figure out ways to fasten new materials like cellulose nanofiber onto other car parts.Anthony Vicari, an applied materials analyst at Lux Research in Boston, said it “would be a big deal�� though if Yano’s projections prove to be correct.But for now, it remains “a very big ‘if’�, he said.	3.372175141
BANGKOK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - PTT Global Chemical Pcl , Thailand’s largest petrochemical producer, is investing in a $900 million polyols facility with two Japanese partners, the company said on Friday.PTTGC CEO Supattanapong Punmeechaow announced in a statement a joint venture in Thailand between PTTGC, Sanyo Chemical Industries and Toyota Tshusho Corporation, Toyota’s trading arm, called GC Polyols.The plant, to be located in the eastern province of Rayong, will have the capacity to produce 130,000 tonnes of polyether polyols per year and PU (polyurethane) system of 20,000 tonnes per year. It will be operational in 2020, the statement said.Polyols is a key material for polyurethane, which is used in the automotive, electrical and electronics and construction sectors.The project has received 23.1 billion baht ($693.7 million)of financing from Krung Thai Bank, Land and Houses Bank, Thanachart Bank and Kiatnakin Bank, the statement said.PTTGC, the petrochemical arm of state-owned energy giant PTT , will hold 82.1 percent of the venture, while Sanyo Chemical and Toyota Tsusho will take 14.9 and 3 percent, respectively.PTTGC said on Tuesday it would invest $5 billion from 2017-2022, at a rate of $1 billion each year.

(Corrects to show that state of California, not Toyota, has pledged to fund building of filling stations in last paragraph)LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles are gaining traction in California, where 22 of the company's Mirai cars have been delivered in its first month of availability, company officials said on Tuesday.Toyota has ambitious plans to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles globally by 2020, ramping up from an expected 2,000 next year. Fuel-cell vehicles are a key component of the company’s plans to curb polluting emissions to nearly zero by 2050.Toyota will accelerate the ramp-up of plans to sell the Mirai in the United States, Bill Fay, U.S. general manager of the Toyota brand, said at a National Automobile Dealers Association-J.D. Power conference linked to the Los Angeles Auto Show.Toyota sells the Mirai at eight California dealerships, and will expand to nearly 40 dealerships there and at a handful of stores in the U.S. Northeast by the end of 2016.“We are at the ground floor of something that could be huge�� Fay said.The first Mirai was delivered to a California customer on Oct. 21.Toyota has received more than 2,000 expressions of interest in the Mirai. The selling of these cars requires that hand-raisers be contacted to determine if they are eligible, including whether they are near a hydrogen filling station.The Toyota executive said there is a “chicken-and-egg�� situation of expanding fuel-cell vehicle sales and establishing a network of hydrogen filling stations.Toyota works with two companies to expand hydrogen filling stations, FirstElement Fuel of California and Air Liquide AIRP.PA of France. On Tuesday, Air Liquide said it would buy U.S. peer Airgas ARG.N in a $13.4 billion deal.Mirai launched in Japan last December and the company is taking orders in Europe as well as in California. Sales will expand next year to five U.S. states - New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.Mirai, which means “future�� in Japanese, is a four-person sedan that has a range of 300 miles. California has pledged $200 million to help build 100 filling stations over the next decade in the state.	0.613447413
LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Aston Martin will challenge for outright victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours race in 2021 with its Valkyrie hypercar, the British luxury sportscar maker announced on Friday after organisers rewrote the rules.The governing FIA, who oversee the World Endurance Championship, and race organisers Automobile Club de L’Ouest, revealed earlier that hypercar derivatives would replace prototypes as the top category from the 2020-21 season.Aston Martin will field two works Valkyries, powered by V12 normally-aspirated engines, as part of a multi-year commitment to a championship currently dominated by Japanese manufacturer Toyota.The announcement comes 60 years after Aston Martin’s sole overall triumph at Le Mans in 1959 with Britain’s Roy Salvadori and American Carroll Shelby.The 2021 Le Mans will also be the 100th anniversary of Aston’s first entry at the Circuit de la Sarthe.“I think you’d say from the brand’s point of view, there’s a little bit of unfinished business to be done,�� Group Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters.Top Formula One designer Adrian Newey, who has won championships with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull, helped create the Valkyrie.The limited edition road legal version costs in the region of 2.5 million pounds ($3.17 million).“We don’t under-estimate the difficulty of an outright win at Le Mans and you never under-estimate the tenacity and resources of Toyota,�� said Palmer.“On the other hand, we’re not coming just to make up the numbers. We’re coming here to give it a bloody good shot.”Palmer said the new regulations would significantly reduce the costs of competing, without giving details about the likely budget, and hoped commercial rivals McLaren and Ferrari would take up the challenge.“It’s not going to cost a shed load of money because that’s the way the regulations have been written,�� he added.The luxury carmaker, which floated on the London Stock Exchange last year, posted an adjusted pre-tax profit of 68 million pounds ($90 million) in 2018.It also reported 136 million pounds of one-off costs due to its initial public offering, pushing it to a reported pre-tax loss of 68 million pounds.Champions Toyota are currently the sole manufacturer in the top LMP1 category and Palmer said the new rules would breathe fresh life into the series.“Very clearly you want to get passion back into the series. Having an almost fait accompli winner slightly takes the polish off the win, doesn’t it?,�� he said.“There’s a huge British fanbase that goes down to Le Mans, so hopefully they will be cheering for David in the David and Goliath competition.”Aston Martin, title sponsors of the Red Bull Formula One team, have a new mid-engined Vanquish model in the planning pipeline to take on Ferrari and Palmer said the company’s motorsport ventures laid the groundwork for that.“It’s all about seeding the ground, making it not unexpected for Aston to come with a world class mid-engined car because we’ve proven it in Formula One and at Le Mans,�� he said.“And therefore it becomes a natural competitor to a Lamborghini or a Ferrari or a McLaren.��	2.786502376
DETROIT - (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N on Wednesday unveiled the new-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact car, a linchpin of its effort to attract new buyers to the brand and a symbol of the U.S. automaker's competitive challenges.The 2016 Cruze, which goes on sale early next year, will be larger than its predecessor but about 250 pounds lighter. It will generate $1,500 more profit per car than the old model, GM estimated.Cool technology features are aimed at young buyers, including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to link smartphone screens to the car’s dashboard screen. GM sells the Cruze in 40 markets, including the United States, China, Brazil and India.The more high-tech Cruze is part of a broader product strategy that GM Chief Executive Mary Barra points to when making her case that GM can thrive without taking on a partner, such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI.GM’s revamped compact sedan will drive into a crowd of competitors with similar performance, features and functionality in the same price range �� about $16,000 to $26,000 in the United States.GM touted the 40 miles per gallon the car's new four cylinder engine should deliver on the highway. This would match the fuel economy rating for Ford Motor Co's F.N competing Focus model on sale now.Sales of the current Cruze in the United States, Chevrolet's largest market, lag those of the small car leaders, Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Corolla and Honda Motor Co Ltd's 7267.T Civic.Toyota has sold 159,486 Corollas in the United States through May 31 this year, while GM has sold 105,291 Cruzes. Many small and midsize sedans have taken a hit in the United States and China as consumers opt for sport utility vehicles.GM Executive Vice President Alan Batey, global head of the Chevrolet brand, said Wednesday one of his goals for the new Cruze is to rely less on sales to rental car fleets. While that would dent sales, the expected gain in resale values for the car would help it in the long term, he said.Batey said Chevrolet will not entirely abandon fleet sales for the Cruze, but going forward “somewhere between 15 to 20 percent is a pretty good number.”Chevy also plans to reduce sales to rental fleets of its redesigned midsize Malibu sedan due to be launched later this year.	-2.283680581
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. 7203.T said on Sunday it will not resume operations through Wednesday near the Chinese port of Tianjin, where huge explosions last week killed more than 100 people.Wednesday’s explosions came during holidays for the Japanese carmaker, so there has been no impact so far on production at its three lines near the affected area, Toyota said in a statement.“However, due to ongoing evacuation advisories, none of the three lines at Tianjin FAW Toyota Motor Co Ltd will be (in) operation from Aug. 17 through 19,�� Toyota said.The company said it had no further information on damage or injuries. It said Friday more than 50 of its employees were injured in the explosions.The death toll in the port city hit 112 on Sunday with 95 people still missing, the official Xinhua news agency said, suggesting the toll could rise significantly.Tianjin is the gateway to northeast China, though which about 40 percent of China’s imported cars enter the country.	-4.590599828
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS said on Tuesday its China sales jumped 26 percent to 86,729 vehicles in April from a year earlier, maintaining its momentum in the world's biggest car market.The results come as Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor 7203.T attempt to recover from sluggish sales in China last month.	-1.378359752
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is considering trimming its 2012 group-wide production plan by about 2 percent because of a drop in sales in China after a territorial row, a Japanese newspaper reported, but the company denied it had altered its target.Asia’s top automaker may cut its calendar-year production forecast for 10.05 million vehicles by around 200,000 vehicles, the Mid-Japan Economist newspaper said on its website on Thursday, without citing sources. The regional daily is based in central Japan, where Toyota’s headquarters is located.“The figure cited in the report is not based on anything announced by us, and at this time there are no changes to the figures we presented earlier,�� said Toyota spokeswoman Shino Yamada.Shares in Toyota had risen 1.8 percent as of 0204 GMT to 3,115 yen, outperforming the Nikkei .N225 index, which was up 1.26 percent.Tetsuro Ii, the Chief Executive Officer of Commons Asset Management, said the shares rose because of a favorable dollar-yen exchange rate, and that investors do not see a big dent in the firm’s profits from the possible production cut.“Because Toyota is very aware of the global slowdown at the moment, they’re trying hard to control their inventory and so they tend to put out very conservative estimates,�� he said.The yen, which has been trading recently in the 78-yen range against the dollar, weakened to about 79.1 yen in morning trade. A strong yen makes it more expensive for Japanese automakers to export cars from Japan.Toyota's original production target, which includes output at Daihatsu Motor 7262.T and Hino Motors 7205.T, would make Toyota the first automaker to produce more than 10 million vehicles in a year.Showroom traffic and sales across China have plunged at Japanese car makers since mid-September when violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out in China over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.Toyota and its two local Chinese partners saw sales drop 48.9 percent in September from a year earlier to 44,100 vehicles.A source previously told Reuters that Toyota’s production cutbacks in China were likely to extend through November, a move that would almost certainly put the company’s goal of selling 1 million cars in China this year out of reach.Toyota, whose sales in China accounted for about 12 percent of its total global vehicle sales in 2011, is less exposed to the world's biggest auto market than rivals Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T.Analysts have said that Japanese automakers could see a dent in sales in China for months. Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said that the impact could last three months in an optimistic scenario and up to six months in a pessimistic scenario.Toyota has forecast group-wide global sales of 9.76 million vehicles in calendar year 2012. The automaker is set to announce its July-to-September earnings results on November 5.	6.113870844
June 11 (Reuters) - Audi’s Le Mans winner Loic Duval emerged unscathed from a huge high-speed crash that halted practice for the 24 Hours sportscar race on Wednesday.The Frenchman, a first time winner last year who shares his car with Denmark’s nine-time champion Tom Kristensen and Brazilian Lucas Di Grassi, was extracted from the mangled wreckage and taken to hospital in Le Mans.Audi Sport reported on their official Twitter feed that the driver, whose car was destroyed in the impact after leaving the track at the Porsche Curves, was “unhurt apart from two grazes to the skin��.The team added that they would do all they could to get the number one car ready for qualifying.Last year’s race was marred by tragedy when Kristensen’s compatriot Allan Simonsen, who was driving an Aston Martin, died in an accident only minutes after the start.Audi will be chasing their 13th Le Mans victory this weekend since their debut in 1999, and fifth in a row.They face a tough challenge from Toyota and Porsche, returning as a full works team for the first time in 16 years with Australian former F1 driver Mark Webber.The 82nd edition of the race, to be waved away by Ferrari’s double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso, starts at the Sarthe circuit in western France on Saturday.

OSAKA Japan/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is struggling to crack the affordable end of India's car market and has called on mini-car affiliate Daihatsu for help - a tacit admission that the Japanese autos giant doesn't always get it right in emerging markets.A similar partnership between Toyota and 51 percent-owned Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T has proved successful for years in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest car market - though that crown may be slipping now. Toyota Executive Vice President Yasumori Ihara asked Daihatsu management earlier this year to help design affordable small cars suited to buyers in India, where Toyota models tend to come with a relatively high price tag, said four Daihatsu executives and a Toyota executive with knowledge of the matter.The request could see Daihatsu take the lead in developing no-frills cars that would be sold under the Toyota name and through Toyota’s sales channels in India. Unlike in Indonesia, Daihatsu currently doesn’t sell cars in India.“Toyota is struggling big time in India�� largely because it uses relatively “high-quality, high-spec�� components for its cars there and failed to make use of cheaper parts available from indigenous local suppliers, a senior Daihatsu executive told Reuters.In contrast, rivals such as Suzuki 7269.T have set up comprehensive local supply chains for low-cost parts in India.“We’re currently looking extensively into why a strategic no-frills car like (Toyota’s) Etios doesn’t sell well in India ... as part of an effort to ready ourselves in case we’re asked (to develop low-cost cars) formally by Toyota,�� another senior Daihatsu executive said. The executives didn’t want to be named as they are not authorized to talk to the media.They gave no specific details of how Daihatsu would help Toyota’s India effort, but said Indonesia would likely serve as a model. There, several models including the most affordable minicar, the Agya, which Toyota markets, are supplied by Daihatsu, which also competes in the market.“We always look at various options, including collaboration with Daihatsu. However, no decisions have been made,�� said Ryo Sakai, a Tokyo-based Toyota spokesman, declining to elaborate.Daihatsu spokesman Kazuki Inoue said: “We have been discussing ways to quickly realize an expansion of our business cooperation with Toyota beyond Indonesia and Malaysia for some time, but nothing specific has been decided at this point.”Daihatsu already sells cars that start from $7,000-$8,000 and aims to come up with even cheaper models to drive its business in emerging markets.Toyota has struggled to ignite demand for its cars in China and other emerging markets, and India �� which consultant IHS Automotive predicts will overtake Japan as the world’s third biggest auto market by as early as 2019 �� has proved particularly tough.“India is a key market for the next decade. All major automakers will have to figure out how to compete in this market effectively,�� said James Chao, IHS Automotive’s Asia-Pacific director.Toyota launched the Etios for the Indian market in late 2010 and sold 50,157 of them in the year to March 2012. But sales of the compact model, which starts at 570,000 rupees ($9,280), fell 23 percent the following year and 19 percent, to 31,137, in the latest year to end-March. Sales of the Etios Liva hatchback, a 480,000 rupee ($7,813) model launched in 2011, declined nearly a third in the year to March compared with two years ago, to 22,201 cars.Toyota's overall India sales for the year to March fell 22 percent to 128,811 vehicles, dwarfed by market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's MRTI.NS 1.05 million vehicles sold. To put the Japanese giant's Indian business in context, Toyota expects to sell a total of 9.05 million vehicles worldwide in the year to March 2015. IHS Automotive forecasts sales in India of so-called light vehicles - below 6 tons - will increase just 0.2 percent this year to 3.14 million.	8.216061347
TOKYO, June 11 (Reuters) - The self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank Corp and Toyota Motor plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia next year, in its first overseas foray, its chief executive said on Tuesday.Monet, which is developing an on-demand self-driving service platform, is planning to export a basic version of the system, Chief Executive Junichi Miyakawa told Reuters.“Our first step will likely be to Southeast Asia, as applications like transportation services in smart cities, or airport shuttle systems,�� Miyakawa said, adding that Monet could begin introducing such services in 2020.Monet is the first-ever alliance between Japan’s No. 3 telco and its largest automaker. SoftBank Corp, a unit of investment behemoth SoftBank Group Corp, is the largest shareholder in the venture, which was announced last October, with a 40.2% share, while Toyota owns 39.8%.It plans to roll out on-demand bus and car services in Japan in the next year, and a platform to operate self-driving vehicles as early as 2023 based on Toyota’s boxy “e-palette�� multi-purpose vehicle.Honda Motor Co and Toyota’s truck making subsidiary Hino Motors took a roughly 10% stake each in the venture in March, and Miyakawa said that it would soon take more investment from the domestic auto industry.“We’re planning to announce an expansion in our stakeholders sometime this month,�� he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Most Japanese car makers including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T have resumed operations at their plants that were suspended after heavy snow disrupted parts deliveries, companies said on Tuesday, limiting impact on their domestic production volume.But Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T said it suspended operations on Tuesday morning at its plant in Hiroshima as parts deliveries were delayed and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said operations at one of its plants were still stalled.Heavy snow around Japan has closed many roads, disrupting the delivery of goods and suspending car production for one or more days at Toyota, Nissan, Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T, Mazda and Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T as they rush to meet strong demand for cars ahead of a sales tax hike in April.“It may be difficult to fully catch up on the lost production volume, though that is up to how much the companies can operate their plants on the weekends,�� said Satomi Hamada, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive.There will be little impact on domestic sales, she added, because car makers are likely to focus on making vehicles for the domestic market to meet strong demand rather than for exports.Toyota resumed operations on Tuesday at all four plants affected by the weather, including the Tsutsumi plant where it makes the popular Prius hybrid, spokeswoman Kayo Doi said.The four plants account for about 30 percent of Toyota’s Japanese production and about 60 percent of vehicles made at the four plants are exported, according to an estimate by IHS Automotive’s Hamada.Honda, Suzuki and Fuji Heavy also resumed operations on Tuesday at their suspended plants, company spokespeople said. Fuji Heavy said it is still undecided on plans for Wednesday.	-6.813053289
TOYOTA CITY, Japan, March 27 (Reuters) - In a corner of Toyota’s oldest factory, the Japanese carmaker’s longest-serving employee preaches the benefits of craftsmanship, saying manual labour is the key to success in a highly automated automotive industry.Mitsuru Kawai, 67, joined Toyota’s technical academy from junior high school more than half a century ago, and believes that even in today’s sleek, streamlined, robot-filled factories there’s a place for manual skills to be learned, honed and encouraged.The world’s biggest automaker will this year launch its first car as part of its Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) initiative - where common platforms and powertrains will be used across many models, cutting production costs by as much as a fifth.This should make production processes “simpler and slimmer�� by cutting down on the variations of parts across the range of models. But Kawai, senior technical executive, has made it his mission to set aside part of each Toyota factory for manual labour - an area where creative ideas keep flowing.“Today’s automation is the result of quantifying, standardising and building in the exceptional skills that people honed by hand,�� Kawai told reporters at the Honsha plant on Friday, noting that even the model for the new TNGA platform was hand-forged, then worked into a blueprint.“To keep building better cars, we have to take our manual skills to the next level. Machines can’t train machines,�� said Kawai, the last surviving employee to have worked with Taichi Ohno, the founder of the vaunted Toyota Production System, which gave the world ‘just-in-time�� production.One recent ‘kaizen��, or improvement, introduced at the Takaoka plant in central Japan this year: a molding machine that uses electric currents rather than a gas furnace, helping reduce the space needed for the process by 60 percent, and costs by a fifth.Kawai’s ‘back to basics�� approach fits Toyota President Akio Toyoda’s strategy for the company his grandfather founded. Despite brisk sales growth, Toyoda declared a 3-year freeze from 2012 on new factories, calling an “intentional pause�� to ensure Toyota’s expansion is measured and sustainable.“When I graduated from the academy and started working in 1966, Toyota had two factories producing 300,000 vehicles,�� Kawai recalls. “Last year, we built 10 million ... We’re at the stage where we’re trying to make sure sustainable growth can continue.”Toyoda recognises the role that factory hands have played in the company’s success. Kawai, 67, will be promoted next month to senior managing officer - the first blue-collar worker to join Toyota’s executive ranks. (Editing by Ian Geoghegan)	-1.325850579
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T cars won in six of the 19 categories in an annual auto industry reliability survey published on Wednesday, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU.N trailed in the bottom three of the report's main rankings.Consultancy J.D. Power’s closely-watched 2018 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study, put Toyota ninth overall and its Lexus luxury vehicle division first in the survey of owners of three-year old cars.Overall the study showed a 9 percent improvement in vehicle dependability from 2017, the first time the industry-wide score has improved since 2013.“Strong dependability scores not only improve demand for used vehicles, but also are a contributor to higher residual values,�� Jonathan Banks, Vice President of Vehicle Analysis and Analytics at J.D. Power said.“Improving dependability ultimately supports new vehicle sales and provides a better perception of the brand.”Lexus topped the rankings for a seventh consecutive year with a score of 99 problems per hundred cars, compared to 127 for Toyota overall.Porsche was a close second with 100 problems per hundred and Buick third with 116 �� the strongest performance for dependability among mass-market brands.The study measures the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles during the past 12 months by original owners of 2015 model-year vehicles, with a lower score reflecting higher quality.The survey also said that, while FCA was the third worst rated overall with 192 problems per hundred, Fiat was also the most improved.“All FCA US brands improved their scores year-over-year in J.D. Power’s 2018 Vehicle Dependability Study, with the exception of the Chrysler Brand,�� FCA U.S said in a statement.“The Chrysler Brand’s ranking is primarily attributed to a launch year of the Chrysler 200, which is no longer in production.”The study is based on responses from 36,896 original owners.	-5.499704317
TOKYO/BEIJING, May 14 (Reuters) - Takata Corp will not set aside more cash to pay for an expanding car recall linked to its air bag inflators because the defect cited by automakers was not “officially recognised��, analysts quoted its chief financial officer as saying.Takata CFO Yoichiro Nomura was speaking to analysts on Thursday at a company briefing that was closed to the media, but two analysts told Reuters that the executive said he saw no reason to set aside more cash.Earlier, Honda Motor Co and Daihatsu Motor Co said they would recall more than 5 million cars to replace potentially fatal air bag inflators made by Takata, a day after Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co said they were taking back 6.5 million vehicles.

* May factory output falls 8.4% m/m, more than forecast -5.6%* Jobless rate at 3-year high, job availability at 5-year low* Weak data suggests economy sliding deeper into recession* Manufacturers expect output to rebound* Govt maintains view output is “lowering sharply�� (Adds bankruptcies data, car output, detail)TOKYO, June 30 (Reuters) - Japan’s industrial output fell for a fourth straight month in May to the lowest level since the global financial crisis and the jobless rate hit a three-year high, underscoring the broad economic pain caused by the coronavirus.The world’s third-largest economy is bracing for its worst postwar recession, hurt by coronavirus lockdown measures at home and overseas that have upended supply chains, kept businesses shut and depressed consumer spending.Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) data out on Tuesday showed that factory output fell 8.4% month-on-month in May to 79.1, a level not seen since March 2009 when the financial crisis sapped global demand.“The economy likely suffered a big contraction in April-June due to weak domestic and external demand,�� said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.“Domestic demand may look up from June, but exports will remain very weak, putting a drag on overall economic recovery,�� he said, adding that the worsening of the economy would flow on to the labour market.The deterioration in economic conditions has triggered an increase in the jobless rate and a fall in the number of available jobs, while stoking fears of bankruptcies.The seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 2.9% in May from 2.6% in April, separate government data showed, the highest rate since May 2017.While the jobless rate remained below 3%, less than in many advanced countries, economists say the actual figure is higher, given the rise in furloughed staff and the impact of discouraged workers who have stopped seeking jobs.The coronavirus fallout has pushed 290 firms into bankruptcy since the end of February, with many service-sector firms like restaurants, hotels and inns and apparel suffering the most, data from private credit research firm Teikoku Databank showed.The decline in factory output followed a 9.8% drop in the prior month, and was much bigger than the median market forecast of a 5.6% drop in a Reuters poll of economists, the data showed.On a positive note, manufacturers surveyed by METI expect output to rise 5.7% in June and 9.2% in July.The government, however, left its assessment of industrial production unchanged, saying it was “lowering sharply��, the bleakest official view since late 2008.Output of cars, production machinery, steel and other broad industries were hit hard by slumping demand at home and abroad due to the pandemic. All industries surveyed posted a fall in output.Global production at Japan’s major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, slumped 62% in May from a year ago, following a 55% fall in April, as car demand plunged globally amid lockdowns to stop the virus from spreading.Japan’s economy shrank an annualised 2.2% in January-March, slipping into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years, and analysts expect the health crisis to have driven a deeper slump in the current quarter.The number of employees fell in May by 730,000 workers compared to a year earlier, posting the biggest annual decline since November 2009, a government official said.The number of furloughed workers stood at 4.23 million, the second highest on record after hitting an all-time high of 5.97 million in April.The jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.20 in May from 1.32 in April, falling at its fastest pace since 1974 to mark the lowest reading since July 2015, labour ministry data showed. It means six jobs were available per five job-seekers. (Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Richard Pullin)	-2.523282655
SEOUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Hankook Tire Co Ltd said on Monday it has begun supplying tyres to Daimler AG for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class and E-Class sedans, a step up in brand recognition for South Korea’s top tyre maker which has been eager to expand further in the premium tyre market.The deal with the luxury car maker was one of several new contracts for Hankook, currently the world’s seventh-largest tyre maker.It also said it has added Nissan Motor Co Ltd to its customer base with a deal to supply tyres for the new Altima sedan.Hankook also plans to expand its partnership with BMW to the 5-Series premium sedans, on top of the 1- and 3-Series, and will supply tyres for Toyota Motor Corp’s new Corolla compact sedan in addition to the iQ minicar.Hankook Tire, a family-controlled business owned by Chairman Cho Yang-rai, also counts Audi AG, Honda Motor Co Ltd , Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co among its customers, in addition to Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp.	2.70313757
TORONTO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp has been fined C$4.7 million ($4.25 million) for rigging bids to supply equipment for Toyota Motor Corp cars made in Canada, the country’s Competition Bureau said on Thursday.Panasonic pleaded guilty to two counts of bid-rigging under the Competition Act and was fined by Ontario courts.Evidence showed Panasonic conspired with another Japanese parts manufacturer on which company would win bids to supply certain switches and sensors to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada Inc, a unit of the Japanese auto maker, the Competition Bureau said.The parts were supplied to Toyota in Canada for 2008 models of the Corolla, Matrix, and RAV4, and for the 2009 model of the Lexus RX 350,the bureau added.The competition bureau’s investigation began more than four years ago as part of a major international probe into auto component supplies.	-7.220216606

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk put electric heavy commercial trucks on the map in November 2017 when he unveiled the company's futuristic, battery-powered Semi, booked hundreds of orders and said he would start delivering the vehicles by 2019.Now, it looks like 2020 could be the big year for electric big rigs. Incumbent truck makers are accelerating their electric truck projects toward launches that year, while Musk told investors in June production of the eye-catching Semi freight hauler should begin “basically (in the) first half of 2020�� instead of 2019.Driven by regulatory pressure to cut diesel pollution, commercial truck makers have made a flurry of fresh announcements to deliver battery electric or hydrogen-fueled vehicles. They have landed orders from big fleet operators such as Walmart Inc WMT.N, United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and Anheuser Busch Inbev NV ABI.BR. The challenge is gauging how big the market for electric commercial trucks will be, especially outside of China.The limited range of most first-generation electric or hydrogen commercial trucks and a lack of charging infrastructure threaten to limit sales to short-haul operations.In China, regulators are considering a long-term plan to replace 1 million diesel big rigs with cleaner trucks, including electric models, and some Chinese ports and cities are banning diesel trucks, which could significantly boost sales.In the United States, the outlook for electric truck demand is cloudier. Some analysts estimate that by the mid-2020s, U.S. annual electric truck sales may number only in the hundreds. Over the last 12 months, North American diesel and so-called semitruck orders totaled 497,000 units.Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T experience at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach illustrates the potential, and the problems for clean truck technology.The first of Toyota’s working hydrogen fuel-cell trucks was designed with a 200-mile (322 km) range for daily operations and has already logged more than 10,000 miles running short routes around the ports.The newer second iteration has a 300-mile range but that is still well short of the 1,000 miles or more diesel trucks can run between refueling stops.Toyota has not provided a production timeline, but executive program manager Chris Rovik said “so far we feel confident the technology is absolutely applicable to this type of use case.”�CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM”Fueling infrastructure is a major headache for electric and hydrogen trucks.Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS commercial vehicle director Mark Freymueller describes a chicken-and-egg problem: Trucking companies are reluctant to buy trucks without fueling stations, but fuel station operators will not install them without trucking customers.Battery electric trucks can take hours to recharge and charging stations are scarce in most U.S. states. Hydrogen trucks can be refueled in about the same time as a diesel truck - but hydrogen refueling stations are even rarer, with most concentrated in California.“Fueling infrastructure is a very important first step,�� said Chris Cannon, chief sustainability officer for the Port of Los Angeles. “The trucks may work great, but if they can’t get any fuel they can’t operate.”Last month, the California Air Resources Board announced $41 million in grants to the port toward building 10 new hydrogen fuel-cell electric trucks to be developed by Toyota and Paccar Inc PCAR.O unit Kenworth. The grant will also partly-fund two new hydrogen fuel stations to be built by Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.AS. Most manufacturers see short-haul routes such as drayage services to or from ports or rail yards as likely first adopters of electric or hydrogen trucks.""We think the first applications are going to be shorter haul,"" said Denny Mooney, Navistar International Corp's NAV.N vice president of engineering. ""We're going to start out where the business makes sense.""Tesla customers like Deutsche Post DPWGn.DE unit DHL, which has ordered 10 Semis, say they could save tens of thousands of dollars on maintenance and fuel annually. CEO Musk says the Semi’s range could hit 600 miles. But a spokesperson said running uphill with air conditioning on or running other appliances would cut that range. Many modern 18-wheelers contain televisions, fridges and other appliances.Package delivery giant UPS has pre-ordered 125 Tesla Semis and will use them on daily routes hauling packages between hubs and on UPS Freight routes between businesses - mostly shorter routes.“In many ways we are ideally suited to be an early adopter of this technology because we don’t have much long-haul business,�� said UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara.Tesla is working with potential customers including UPS, Pepsico PEP.O and Anheuser-Busch to build charging stations at their facilities.Nikola Motor Co, a startup offering a fuel cell truck, has ambitious multibillion-dollar plans to build 700 U.S. hydrogen fueling stations over the next decade, starting along the major routes of Anheuser-Busch, which has ordered up to 800 trucks, says CEO Trevor Milton.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Kion KGX.DE and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T are in talks to buy Japanese forklift truck maker UniCarriers [INCJPG.UL] for up to 100 billion yen ($833 million), a source familiar with the matter said, confirming a Nikkei report.UniCarriers is strong in Japan and in the United States where Kion, which has been steadily growing through acquisitions over the past years, has only a small presence.It made sales of 175 billion yen in fiscal 2013.Kion, the world's biggest forklift truckmaker after Toyota Industries 6201.T, is strong in Europe, China and South America and in the premium segment of the forklift truck market, while UniCarriers is stronger in mass-market forklifts.A spokesman for Kion declined to comment on the report.Kion owns brands including Linde, Still and Baoli as a result of its takeovers, and allows the companies it buys to keep their own identity in a so-called multibrand strategy.Shares in Kion were up 0.4 percent to 38.60 euros by 0830 GMT.($1 = 120.1000 yen)	1.068746389
Rookie Byron wins first Xfinity raceBy Rob Gray, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeNEWTON, Iowa -- Last week, a blink-of-an-eye moment weighed heavily on William Byron.Saturday, the driver of the No. 9 JR Motorsports Chevrolet lifted his head and shouted out a pent-up yelp that formed the suitable soundtrack the rookie’s first career NASCAR Xfinity Series victory, the American Ethanol E15 250 presented by Enogen.“I feel it all kind of comes around in racing and last week we were so close,�� said Byron, who finished .012 seconds behind Joe Gibbs Racing veteran Denny Hamlin last Saturday at Michigan International Speedway. “You’ve got to have a little bit off luck to win every race that we win and I feel like we got one back for last week.”The final restart with 10 laps to go came just 11 laps after the previous one during which Byron pitted and capped off fuel while taking tires.Good fortune finally found Byron again, who never was seriously challenged down the stretch, but only had four or five laps of fuel left before his last pit stop helped set the stage for victory.“We definitely got a huge break the way the caution fell right there,�� Byron’s crew chief, Dave Elenz, told FS1 pit reporters during a caution period with 15 laps to go.Byron made the most of it. He won last year at Iowa, but in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.“It’s awesome just to kind of come this far,�� said Byron, who received a congratulatory call from Rick Hendrick after the win.The ninth caution of the night also benefitted some less familiar top-10 finishers, including Ryan Sieg, who ran second to notch his fourth career top-five finish in 117 series starts. Tyler Reddick took third.“It was fun racing with Tyler at the end,�� Sieg said. “We had a little bit of a battle.”Christopher Bell -- in the second leg of his first double-duty weekend -- started on the pole and remained on point the entire first stage, fending off an early challenge from teammate Kyle Benjamin, and a late charge from Sam Hornish, Jr., who made his first start in nine months.Hornish led 183 laps while winning last season at Iowa, but misfortune struck 19 laps into stage two as Bell made contact with his rear fender -- an encounter that sent Hornish careening into the wall.It also ended the veteran stock car and open-wheel racer’s first night back with Team Penske.“He came up pretty hard when he got loose and hit me,�� said Hornish, who is slated to run a limited schedule this season. “Of course, we got the brunt of it. I’m disappointed. This is one of my favorite places to come to.”Points leader Elliott Sadler shares that sentiment -- even though mostly bad luck plagued his night.He qualified fourth, but was sent to the rear after an unapproved pre-race adjustment was made on his car. No matter. He’d ascended to fifth by the end of the first stage and ended up eighth.Bell settled for 16th after he was collected in an incident involving Brennan Poole and Ryan Reed -- the caution that benefitted Byron and others.Bell led 152 laps to Byron’s 78, but as both drivers know, it’s the last lap that counts.Especially Byron, who vocally and visually celebrated this week after enduring quiet disappointment the last.“To get second last week kind of hurt, just because we were that close,�� Byron said. “But I feel like it gave us extra motivation, and I feel like last year the beginning of the summer was when I kind of hit my stride and I think we won back-to-back, so to now have a second and a first feels really good.”NASCAR Xfinity Series Race -- American Ethanol E15 250 presented by EnogenIowa SpeedwayNewton, IowaSaturday, June 24, 20171.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's 7267.T quarterly profit surged nearly eight-fold on a rebound in its key North American market, prompting Japan's third-biggest carmaker to reaffirm its full-year earnings outlook and maintain its ambitious global sales target.Sales volumes surged globally in the three months to June as Honda’s restored production network, wrecked by last year’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand, finally caught up with pent-up demand. The company’s market share has recovered to pre-quake levels in the United States, its largest market, industry data shows.While Honda still faces headwinds from a strong yen and its April-June profit missed analysts' forecasts, Japan's auto firms are showing signs of strength. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is set to raise its 2012 global sales target, according to Japanese media reports, while auto parts maker Denso Corp 6902.T boosted its full-year operating profit forecast by 22 percent.“There’s two tales here,�� said Christopher Richter, analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, of Honda’s quarterly results.“They’ve had some huge growth and decent margins but at the same time below what analysts have been expecting.”Honda, which makes Accord sedans and Super Cub motorcycles, was hit much harder than rivals Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Toyota in the last financial year by natural disasters in Japan and Thailand that disrupted supply chains.It has set a global sales target of 4.3 million vehicles in the financial year to March 2013, up 38.4 percent from the previous year, with North America to account for about 40 percent of the total.“While there are various risk factors such as economic conditions and currency moves, as well as a uncertainty over demand, Honda will maintain its forecast,�� Honda Chief Financial Officer Fumihiko Ike told reporters.“We think that our (April-June) operating profit of 176 billion yen ($2.25 billion) is basically on track when we compare it with our guideline of 620 billion yen for the financial year,�� he said.Whether Honda can achieve its ambitious sales target will depend in part on how its flagship Accord sedan is received in the U.S. market after a revamp this fall with a new generation of engines and transmissions to boost fuel efficiency.But competition has heated up, especially from a resurgent U.S. industry and emerging South Korean rivals.“There are too many models in a segment that used to be dominated by Japanese brands,�� Kunihiko Shiohara, managing director at Credit Suisse in Tokyo, said before the announcement.Japan's auto giants have proved their resilience, however, with Toyota leapfrogging past General Motors Co GM.N as the world's largest automaker in the first half of this year as its production network recovered from last year's disasters.Toyota has forecast record sales of 9.58 million vehicles for this year, and the output revisions that Japanese media said on Tuesday would soon be announced will bring it close to the 10 million mark.Denso boosted its full-year operating profit forecast by 22 percent to 250 billion yen, lifting its shares by 1.8 percent to their highest close in three weeks.But Japan’s exporters have also got little respite from the steady rise in the yen, which reduces their competitiveness against South Korean automakers and other overseas rivals, and eats into income earned abroad when it is converted into yen.Nissan, Japan’s No.2 automaker, and the quickest to recover from last year’s disasters, reported a worse-than-expected 20 percent drop in quarterly profit last week.The company stuck to its full-year target, however, vowing that a revamped version of its Altima sedan would bolster its earnings.Honda’s falling short of expectations in its latest quarter, said CLSA’s Richter, followed the same pattern.“I think it’s similar to what we saw with Nissan -- higher sales expenses in North America ... geared to clearing out inventory and preparing for new launches.”Shares in Honda have fallen nearly 20 percent in the financial year that began in April, the biggest drop among the top three Japanese carmakers.Before the earnings announcement on Tuesday, Honda shares ended at 2,551 yen, up 2.1 percent, versus a 0.7 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei 225 average .N225.($1 = 78.1900 Japanese yen)	4.862109528
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it would market more than 10 all-electric vehicle (EV) models globally in the early 2020s, a target which could require the firm to look beyond a partnership with Panasonic Corp 6752.T to co-develop and supply batteries. Setting an annual sales target of around 1 million zero-emission battery EVs and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) by 2030, the automaker said in order to achieve this it would need to make an investment of over $13 billion to develop and make batteries.Toyota, the world's second-largest automaker by sales after Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, added it needed to accelerate the pace of battery development as tightening global vehicle emissions regulations would require a steep increase in manufacturing capacity for more powerful batteries.“As a mass-market automaker we need to expand our offering of electric cars,�� Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi said at a briefing in Tokyo on Monday, adding that Toyota would introduce pure-battery models initially in China, followed by Japan, India, the United States and Europe.Industry experts anticipate plug-in hybrid petrol-electric vehicles and all-battery EVs will account for as much as 26 percent of global car sales by 2030, versus just over 1 percent last year, data from the International Energy Agency shows.Toyota has ramped up its EV development since last year when it announced it would add fully electric vehicles to its product line-up, surprising some industry players as it had long touted a green-car strategy focusing mainly on plug-in hybrid and FCVs.Toyota expects EVs to account for around half of its global sales by 2030, when it aims to sell 4.5 million petrol-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles annually.Volkswagen is aiming for 2-3 million EV sales by 2025.Last week, Toyota said it and partner Panasonic were considering developing next-generation EV batteries, including solid state batteries, while it has also tied up with Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T on EVs.At the moment, supply of EV batteries is dominated by a huddle of producers including LG Chem 051910.KS and Panasonic.Terashi said joining forces with Panasonic may not be enough to meet its battery needs by 2030, and that Toyota was open to striking additional partnerships.Producing batteries for so many EVs would pose a challenge “on a different dimension��, said Terashi, who heads Toyota’s EV business planning department.“Even if we develop an advanced solid state battery, there’s no way we could mass produce it on our own.��	10.52466227
* Document circulated ahead of Riga energy talks* European Commission to publish energy union vision this monthBRUSSELS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Electric vehicles should be “a high priority��, the European Commission says in a discussion paper that maps out its vision for a single energy union based on improved power and gas connections and the free flow of fuel across the European Union.Some business interests, including major utilities, such as E.ON, as well as environmental groups, have been pushing for more focus on electric vehicles.“Electrification of transport should be a high priority, with full integration of electric vehicles in urban mobility policies and in the electricity grid,�� the Commission memo seen by Reuters says.Attempts to increase the share of biofuels to reduce emissions from transport have foundered after research showed the early biofuels could be worse for the planet than conventional transport fuel.More sophisticated biofuels, which do not cause rainforest clearance or fight with food supply, are still far more expensive than conventional fuel.Advocates of electric vehicles say that, provided the electricity is from renewable sources, they are a better solution to decarbonise transport, which accounts for about a third of EU fuel use. Currently the transport sector is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuel.A group of organisations, including Eurelectric, which represents EU utilities, and environment campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, make the case for including electric transport in discussion of improved cross-border energy links in a letter sent to all the EU commissioners, dated Feb. 1.Reducing dependence on imported fossil fuel from nations such as Russia is one of the main drivers of the latest EU push for a single energy union, which will be the subject of talks bringing together EU energy ministers and commissioners in Riga on Friday.The debate will be followed by formal publication of the Commission’s energy union strategy at the end of the month.Many member states provide tax incentives to encourage electric and hybrid vehicles, although for private cars the share of the overall vehicle market is still very small and hybrids, rather than pure electric plug-in vehicles that require grid infrastructure, have dominated.Toyota Motor Europe, which leads the European hybrid market, said its sales of Toyota and Lexus hybrid vehicles rose to over 178,000 in 2014, up 13 percent versus 2013.The Commission does not comment on unpublished documents.

* Combined company would be 4th largest in world* Fiat-Renault talks collapsed earlier this year* Deal may be announced as early as Thursday -source (Adds details of the potential deal, including potential dividend to FCA shareholders; adds details on expected board composition)MILAN/PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Talks between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA over a potential tie-up that could create a $50 billion car giant gathered pace on Wednesday, with one source saying a deal could be announced as early as Thursday.The two groups said in separate statements they were holding discussions aimed at creating one of the world’s leading auto makers, better placed to tackle a host of costly technological and regulatory challenges facing the global auto industry.Under the proposed deal Fiat Chrysler would pay shareholders a 5.5 billion euro special dividend, people familiar with the discussions said.Peugeot would spin off its stake in auto parts maker Faurecia valued at around 3 billion euros while Fiat Chrysler could dispose of its stake in factory robot maker Comau valued at about 250 million euros, these people said. Final terms of the agreement could change and have not been formally disclosed, they said.The combined company’s board of directors would have 12 members - five from Peugeot’s side, five from Fiat Chrysler’s, along with chief executive Carlos Tavares and as chairman, John Elkann, currently chairman of Fiat Chrysler, the people said.Both companies have called unscheduled board meetings on Wednesday to discuss the potential deal, the people said, while one source familiar with the discussions said an agreement could be announced as soon as Thursday.Spokespeople for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and PSA declined to comment on a timeline.After ditching a proposed merger with Renault in June, Elkann confirmed the group’s bid to pursue an alternative alliance as carmakers face huge investments in electrification, emission reduction and autonomous driving technologies.Milan-listed shares in FCA rallied more than 10% on Wednesday, after ending up more than 7.5% on Tuesday in New York. Peugeot share rose more than 6% to hit their highest in more than 11 years.The merged entity would still face substantial challenges, as auto manufacturers grapple with a global downturn in demand while trying to develop costly, cleaner car models as deadlines to meet ever more stringent anti-pollution rules loom.A combination of PSA and FCA would have to overcome a series of political, financial and governance hurdles, though it elicited an encouraging early response from the French government, a key PSA shareholder.France’s dithering over FCA’s pursuit of Renault - in which it is also a shareholder - contributed to the collapse of that merger plan.French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said Paris was following the PSA-FCA talks closely with an eye on the fallout for jobs, but said an enlarged group was ultimately “the best path to protecting employment.”The tie-up would leave France with two major players in the global industry, as opposed to the Renault-FCA-Nissan configuration, which left PSA trailing.Morningstar senior equity analyst Richard Hilgert said in a note that total volumes of FCA and PSA, including China joint venture partners, amounted to 8.7 million vehicles last year, ranking the eventual combined group fourth behind Volkswagen , Toyota and the Renault-Nissan alliance , each at more than 10 million vehicles.“We view the combination of these two companies as reasonable given global competition, high capital intensity, and industry disruption from electrified powertrain as well as autonomous technologies,�� Hilgert said.Italy’s industry minister, Stefano Patuanelli, said on Wednesday that Rome - which has no stake in FCA - was following talks between the two groups, but declined to comment further on a “market operation��.Rome is keen to avoid major job losses in Italy, where 58,000 workers are employed by FCA, and with most of its Italian plants heavily underused. Italian trade union FIOM said it was concerned a tie-up with PSA could hit jobs in the country even more than a Renault merger.In Britain, unions flagged their worries for PSA plants there, which make vehicles under the Vauxhall and Opel brands.In addition to the French government’s 12% shareholding in PSA, held via state bank BPI, the Peugeot family and the Chinese government, through Dongfeng Group, each have a similar holding.Dongfeng could use a merger deal to cash out of PSA, two sources close to the talks said. Dongfeng declined to comment. Speculation it was looking for an exit surfaced in August.The talks come as European carmakers struggle to meet tough carbon dioxide emissions targets.Strategy firm PA Consulting has forecast FCA faces a fine of 700 million euros ($777 million) unless it radically changes its emissions profile to sell more electric and hybrid cars.FCA’s first full-electric model, the small 500 BEV, is scheduled to reach customers next year. But a combination with Peugeot would give the carmaker access to PSA’s CMP modular platform, which has already spawned the Peugeot e-208 and the Opel Corsa-e mini.Investors have speculated for years that FCA, itself the product of an Italian-U.S. merger, was hunting for a further partner, encouraged by the rhetoric of the company’s late chief executive Sergio Marchionne.FCA, controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy’s Agnelli family, had discussed a combination with PSA earlier this year, before it proposed a $35 billion merger with Renault.At that time, FCA said a deal with Renault offered more advantages than a combination with PSA, but Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, broke off talks after the French government’s intervention.Lazard is advising Exor, Goldman Sachs is advising FCA, and Mediobanca is advising PSA through its Messier Maris &amp; Associés unit, sources said.($1 = 0.9000 euros)	1.241429087
DETROIT, July 1 (Reuters) - Chrysler Group on Tuesday reported a 9 percent gain in U.S. auto sales for June, beating forecasts for a month expected to show an industrywide decrease from a year earlier.Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, showed a 28 percent gain for Jeep, its biggest brand by sales, and a 12 percent increase for its Ram pickup trucks.Chrysler is the fourth-largest automaker by U.S. sales, behind General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp. Those automakers will report U.S. June sales later on Tuesday.Chrysler’s U.S. sales for June were 171,086, about 5,000 more than the average forecast of nine industry analysts.June sales for the U.S. market overall are expected to fall about 3 percent, but analysts say that is due to two fewer selling days than a year earlier rather than an indication of a weaker new-vehicle market.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The expansion of South Africa’s auto industry is central to the government’s economic development strategy but the coronavirus crisis has forced carmakers into survival mode and could push ambitious growth plans out of reach.Industry officials say the government needs to defer some tax payments for the auto industry and relax the criteria for investment incentives and allowances, or the pandemic could deal the sector a permanent blow.Before the crisis, the government had crafted a plan to supercharge the sector to help revive the country’s struggling economy and form a beachhead for expansion within Africa, the world’s last major untapped market for new cars.But a five-week lockdown has brought a manufacturing and retail industry that accounts for almost 7% of South Africa’s gross domestic product and 30% of its manufacturing output to a virtual standstill.“Those plans will be impacted massively,�� said Mike Mabasa, chief executive of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA). “Particularly for the short to medium term, that plan is completely out of the window.”South Africa has put its so-called automotive masterplan at the heart of attempts to revive growth through industrialisation after years of stagnation and to bring unemployment down from almost 30%.The plan aims to boost growth and create jobs by more than doubling the industry’s annual production to 1.4 million vehicles by 2035 and raising the proportion of auto components made locally to 60% from 39%.The new scheme comes after a series of auto industry development plans and will be supported by investment and tax incentives that have been in place in some form for years.They include a tax-free cash grant starting at 20% of the value of qualifying investments, rising to 25% for component makers, and a tax perk related to vehicle production, known as the vehicle assembly allowance.Mabasa said NAAMSA has asked the government to relax the minimum plant production capacity threshold of 50,000 cars a year needed for the investment incentive as carmakers believe it’s too stringent given the fallout from the crisis.As part of series of requests on behalf of the industry, NAAMSA has also asked the government to use 2019 production numbers and targets for 2020’s vehicle assembly allowance, as output is likely to take a major hit this year.The sector had some relief with the easing of the country’s lockdown on May 1 as it allowed auto manufacturers to return to 50% capacity. But it has had scant response from the government to its calls for specific financial help, besides requests for more information.The Department of Trade and Industry did not respond to requests for comment.Most of South Africa’s automakers referred Reuters to NAAMSA for comment.NAAMSA represents 41 firms - including BMW BMWG.DE, Ford F.N, Mercedes-Benz, Isuzu 7202.T, Nissan 7201.T, Toyota 7203.T and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE - which make some 600,000 vehicles a year in South Africa and export about 65% of them.Mercedes-Benz South Africa said it was not possible to predict the impact of COVID-19 on the 2035 industry targets.“We have constructive relationships with our key stakeholders in suppliers and the government, and are confident that we will be able to find solutions to maintain the competitiveness of the automotive manufacturing sector,�� its corporate affairs manager, Thato Mntambo, told Reuters.NAAMSA’s Mabasa warned that if carmakers struggle for liquidity in the crisis they may be unable to fulfil export orders, worth $9 billion a year across the industry. Local component makers focused on autos could also suffer badly.Industry officials said the damage could be permanent and open the way for upcoming rivals such as Morocco and more established centres like Thailand to steal market share.Andrew Kirby, chief executive of Toyota South Africa, said last month that the risk to the country’s role in global auto industry supply chains stemmed mostly from the vulnerability of its smaller component manufacturers.If either vehicle makers or parts manufacturers cannot deliver their products, international customers will rapidly take their business elsewhere, industry officials said.Renai Moothilal, executive director of the National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers, said there was a strong possibility smaller firms would not survive and that would be disastrous for the government’s drive to boost local output and double employment in the sector.He said levers the government could pull included levy waivers and support for utility and wage bills, but without help it was not hard to see how an industry that has already lost much of its business case might contract rather than expand.“Once global companies move export contracts, and invest in tools of production in another destination, the costs sunk into that move make it improbable that they would want to bring it back to South Africa,�� Moothilal said.NAAMSA’s Mabasa said the overseas headquarters of some local component manufacturers had already indicated they could shift production to divisions outside South Africa.About 90% of the business of one local supplier, SP Metal Forgings (SPF), is in the automotive sector. Chief executive Ken Manners said the initial three-week lockdown alone had probably cost it 12% to 15% of annual turnover.Another local component supplier, Pressure Die Castings (PDC), said it was expecting to lose 15% of its turnover for at least three months from the start of the lockdown.“If we were only in (auto) manufacturing, we probably would have closed the company,�� said Graham Smith, managing director of PDC, which supplies components to several industries.The car sector will benefit from some economy-wide tax measures already announced, such as deferred payments on a carbon tax, but the demands on South Africa’s strained public finances are huge, with many key industries in trouble.With the country’s debt rating now firmly in junk territory and an economic contraction inevitable, there are questions over how it will even pay for measures already announced.Meanwhile, the risk of a return to a more expansive lockdown looms and demand for vehicles at home and abroad has plummeted.IHS Markit senior analyst Walt Madeira said car production will fall too. It forecasts global light vehicle sales will drop to 69.6 million units this year from 89.7 million in 2019, with a 20% decline in South Africa. (tmsnrt.rs/2WbOIfb)And any change of tack by carmakers at the top of the production pyramid will ripple through the industry.“It’s like pushing a big reset button and nobody is quite sure what that means,�� SPF’s Manners said. “It’s very worrying in terms of what our businesses are going to look like in six months.��	7.830235236
NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of European companies fell on Friday, on fresh concerns that Greece may not immediately secure a deal to unlock access to urgently needed international aid.Euro zone finance ministers are unlikely to release a new tranche of loans to Greece on Monday as there is no agreement yet on how to make its debt sustainable but Athens is set to get two more years to cut debt, officials said.Adding to worries, comments by President Barack Obama and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner left investors little hope that a deal to avoid the “fiscal cliff�� - a combination of government spending cuts and tax rises to come into effect by law in early 2013 that may cut the federal budget deficit but also tip the economy back into recession - was on the horizon.European banks were among the hardest hit. U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank fell 2.1 percent to $42.35 and Credit Suisse fell 1 percent to $22.63. New York-traded shares of UBS fell 0.8 percent at $15.08.The BNY Mellon index of leading American depositary receipts was flat, while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index rose 0.4 percent.The BNY Mellon index of leading European ADRs lost 0.1 percent.The BNY Mellon index of leading Asian ADRs added 0.4 percent while the BNY Mellon index of leading Latin American ADRs fell 0.3 percent.U.S.-listed shares of Japan’s Toyota Motor rose 0.5 percent to $78.73 and Nippon Telegraph gained 2.3 percent to $23.30.	10.57915058
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to halt production on Monday morning at 12 plants in central Japan due to a typhoon that is hitting the area, spokesman Ryo Sakai said on Sunday.The 12 plants, which include four vehicle factories as well as engine and automotive parts plants, are all Aichi prefecture in central Japan. Toyota will decide whether to resume production later on Monday depending on the weather conditions, Sakai said.Mitsubishi Motors Corp also plans to halt production at its Okazaki plant in central Japan on Monday morning and afternoon, spokesman Manabu Yamanishi said.Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, Suzuki Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp plan to operate their factories as usual, company spokesmen said.Typhoon Phanfone, which was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, is moving northeast at 25 kph (16 mph) towards central and eastern Japan after lashing parts of the Kyushu and Okinawa islands, the Japan Meteorological Agency said on Sunday.	4.001713796
TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Japan’s Denso Corp, the world’s second-biggest auto parts maker, posted a 16 percent decline in six-month operating profit on Friday, as development costs and investment outweighed a rise in revenue.Denso, 22 percent-owned by Toyota Motor Corp, said operating profit totalled 161.3 billion yen ($1.47 billion) in April-September, while net profit fell 18.5 percent to 122.4 billion yen. Revenue rose 4.2 percent to 2.07 trillion yen.“Despite cost reduction efforts and the increase in production volume, research and development expenditures and investment costs for strengthening future growth led to the decrease in operating income,�� Chief Executive Nobuaki Katoh said in a statement.For the full year to March 31, Denso raised its sales guidance by 2.2 percent to 4.23 trillion yen and kept its operating and net profit forecasts at 350 billion yen and 248 billion yen respectively.Shares of Denso closed morning trade down 3.6 percent after the results were announced, while the benchmark Nikkei average climbed 1.7 percent.

(Reuters) - After surpassing Toyota Motor Corp as the world’s most valuable automaker and stunning with forecast-beating deliveries, Tesla Inc has taken time out to poke fun at the company’s naysayers - with sales of red satin shorts.“Limited edition short shorts now available,�� CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday.Musk has often taken umbrage at short-sellers and in 2018 sent a box of shorts to hedge fund owner and Tesla short-seller David Einhorn.The “Short Shorts�� on the Tesla shop website feature gold trim and “S3XY�� in gold across the back, which also happens to be formed from Tesla model names.The shorts cost $69.420, the last three digits an apparent reference to Musk’s infamous tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, with 420 also a code word for marijuana.That tweet landed him in hot water with the U.S. securities regulator, costing him his position as Tesla chairman.The Silicon Valley car maker, however, has reason to crow. Its stock has almost tripled in value this year to just over $1,200 per share and it sold more than 90,000 of its electric vehicles in the second quarter, defying a trend of plummeting sales for other automakers hit by coronavirus-induced lockdowns.“Run like the wind or entertain like Liberace,�� the product description says, adding: “Enjoy exceptional comfort from the closing bell.�� It will ship within 2-4 weeks.Tesla is expected to announce earnings results for April-June quarter this month, with analysts saying the second-quarter deliveries had heightened expectations that it will report four consecutive quarters of profit for the first time in its history.	-1.701055284

(in 11th para, deletes erroneous reference to the number of companies that have reported earnings so far)SYDNEY, May 13 (Reuters) - Japanese shares dipped further from a two-month high on Wednesday, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street on fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, while some profit taking also weighed on the market.The benchmark Nikkei average fell 0.5% to 20,267.05, with cyclical sectors leading the declines.Traders said some profit booking was inevitable sooner or later because of the recent rally. On Monday, both the Nikkei and the Topix climbed to their highest levels since March 6.Wall Street’s all three major indexes dropped about 2% on Tuesday following a warning from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, that premature moves to reopen the economy could lead to a second wave of cases and set back economic recovery.Investors also kept a watch on simmering U.S.-China tensions after a leading U.S. Republican senator proposed legislation that would authorize President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on China if it fails to give a full account of events leading to the virus outbreak.The broader Topix pared most of the early losses and ended the session at 1,474.69, just 0.1% lower on the day.Analysts suspected the Bank of Japan’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) buying, as part of its stimulus programme, buoyed the market in the afternoon.About two-thirds of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo exchange finished in negative territory.Highly cyclical iron and steel, insurance and air transport sectors were among the worst performers in the main bourse.“COVID-19 has had a significant impact on broad businesses, regardless of industry,�� said Keiichi Ito, chief quant analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.“Among companies which already announced earnings results, about 60% of them have suspended full-year profit guidance, compared with 10% usually.”Shiseido Co Ltd tumbled 4.2% after its net profit plunged by 95.8% in the January-March quarter and as the cosmetics maker withdrew full-year profit and dividend guidance, citing COVID-19 uncertainty.Toyota Motor Corp, the biggest Japanese company by market value, lost 2.2% following the automaker’s warning that its operating profit will slump almost 80% in the current financial year through March 2021.Bucking the overall weakness, NEC Corp jumped 6.5% to a 2-1/2-month high after the electronics maker surprised investors by raising its annual dividend forecast.

NEW YORK, March 28 - Toyota Motor Corp’s top North American executive voiced optimism on Thursday about the U.S. economy and said demand in the industry this year would be driven by the need for consumers to replace aging cars and trucks.Jim Lentz, newly appointed chief executive of North America, said the Japanese automaker sees U.S. industry new-car sales hitting 15.3 million this year, up from 14.5 million in 2012. Just six months ago, its 2013 forecast was for 14.7 million, but the company at the time believed talk of the fiscal cliff’s impact would dampen the economy.“We’re cautiously optimistic about a growing economy, but there’s still a lot of uncertainty that can derail the consumer’s attitude,�� Lentz said in an interview after the New York Auto Show.Offsetting his concerns were the improving mood of consumers, which is being reflected in a stronger housing market and rising stock market, and the need for people to replace cars and trucks, the average age of which has reached an all-time high in the United States of more than 11 years.“When people can look at their 401ks and see that not only have they not fallen, but they are now starting to gain ... that is a real positive to overall consumer confidence,�� Lentz said.Toyota should sell about 2.2 million cars and trucks under its three brands - Toyota, Lexus and Scion - this year, up from 2.08 million in 2012. The company is introducing nine new or updated vehicles this year.Automakers are scheduled to report March U.S. sales on Tuesday and Lentz said Toyota expects the industry’s annual sales rate to finish at about 15.4 million vehicles. That would mark the fifth straight month above the 15 million rate.However, Toyota has no plans to revisit its full-year estimate at this point as Lentz said the company is forecasting the sales rate to slow to a range of 15.1 million to 15.2 million in the second quarter.Lentz said a tightening of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve would have a minimal impact this year and in 2014 on consumers, many of whom have monthly car payments.“Whether you lease or whether you borrow money to buy a car, it’s still all about the monthly payment,�� he said. “Right now, if you look at car payments relative to income, cars have probably never been cheaper even though the price of cars continues to go up. That monthly payment is still very fixed.”However, Lentz agreed that the high residual values that automakers are setting on their leased vehicles is not sustainable. He said Toyota is already adjusting its residual values going forward.“In 2014-2015, this low, low lease party will come to an end,�� he said.Toyota shares closed down 46 cents at $102.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.	15.13534875
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Once at the heart of the global spice trade, Malacca is pumping nearly $3 billion into an ambitious plan to put itself in demand in a different hot commodity - oil.The Malaysian state is reclaiming land along the Straits of Malacca to build a port that can handle the biggest tankers on the planet. The target: a slice of traffic sailing on to nearby Singapore, the top but congested trading hub in a region with $600 billion in annual oil trade - a third of global oil demand.Funded largely by Chinese investors, port operator T.A.G. Marine and developer Linggi Base are building the 12.5 billion ringgit ($2.82 billion) Kuala Linggi International Port (KLIP) to offer storage, repair and refueling services. At Singapore, 200 kilometers away, ships can spend costly time just waiting to deliver or take on goods, refuel or undergo maintenance work.With Singapore's port rules also banning floating storage and ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, the potential for savings and streamlined business is clear for KLIP users like trading company Agritrade Resources 1131.HK. “Through our clients who are oil majors and oil traders, we see a competitive edge in locating our floaters (storage facilities) in KLIP resulting from lower costs and less congestion,�� said Ng Xinwei, Chief Executive of Agritrade, which owns three supertankers.Using 620-acres of reclaimed land, KLIP this month launched construction of a port with 1.5 million cubic meters of oil storage capacity, and dry docks to handle the biggest of oil tankers, hoping for completion within a decade.KLIP is aware business is now dwarfed by Singapore, which handles well over 100,000 vessel calls a year, compared to KLIP’s few thousand per year. KLIP did not provide targets, but analysts estimated it could handle three times current volumes within a decade.“Many of the shipyards in Singapore have been fully booked for three years,�� said Saifullah Noor, Chief Executive of T.A.G. Marine. “Given the close proximity, we aren’t competing with Singapore, but are actually complementing them.”Officials in Singapore did not comment on specific developments in Malaysia, but have previously said that growth in oil markets is strong enough to warrant further investment.That’s a view shared among shipping industry executives, though some also see significance in Malacca’s project being backed by Chinese investors.“I see this as a mainly China-led real estate investment project, under the ‘belt-and-road�� umbrella of Chinese economic expansion into south-east Asia,�� said Ralph Leszczynski of shipping brokerage Banchero Costa.The project is the latest in a string of developments trying to capture a piece of Asia’s rising oil demand. But while the waterways along the Straits of Malacca and Straits of Singapore - some of the busiest in the world - have created huge demand for port services, success is not guaranteed.Malaysia’s Asia Petroleum Hub project, to the West of Singapore, launched in 2005 but was wound up in 2012 amid ballooning costs.At KLIP, operator T.A.G. Marine remains confident that the early stages of the port development project show a track record of success that can continue.KLIP now has one of the region’s largest STS cargo transfer and floating oil storage zones, and has already handled some of the world’s largest oil supertankers, like the ultra large crude carrier “TI Europe�� - half a kilometer long.Singapore clients have been paying attention.One future potential KLIP customer is Singapore-based Toyota Tsusho Petroleum, part of Japanese trading company Toyota Tsusho Corp 8015.T. The fuels supplier has signed a memorandum of understanding with T.A.G. Marine to explore bunkering. “In KLIP, we have a newly developing port that will allow us to diversify our operations and better deploy our resources,�� said Nobuyuki Iida, Toyota Tsusho Petroleum general manager.Beyond the infrastructure, industry players say there’s a need to streamline some of Malaysia’s processes and regulations.“To get it right, (bunker suppliers) need support from the (Malaysia) government to have proper pricing and support from oil majors for cargoes to be competitive with Singapore,�� said Wan Mohd Fauzi, director of Malaysia-based bunker fuel supplier Alamgala Resources.	1.349745331
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is banking on American consumers' desire for something different from cars and crossover utility vehicles to drive demand for its Chevrolet Colorado when the mid-sized pickup trucks re-enter the U.S. market next autumn.As part of the No. 1 U.S. automaker’s so-called “three-truck strategy�� that includes the full-size and heavy-duty Chevy Silverado pickups, the 2015 Colorado and its GMC sibling Canyon are meant to appeal to lifestyle buyers much like Subaru has done with its vehicles, offering space, utility and a refined interior.GM believes the Colorado redux, which will debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday, will be far more successful than its last appearance when U.S. sales peaked in 2005 above 128,000. However, declining popularity and the company’s need to save money during its 2009 bankruptcy reorganization forced it to exit the U.S. market last year.GM, which never stopped selling the Colorado overseas, envisions a profitable return in a segment that was abandoned by its U.S. rivals, Ford Motor Co F.N and Chrysler Group FIA.MI.“We honestly believe from all the research that we’ve done that there’s a lot of people looking for mid-size�� trucks, Alan Batey, GM’s global Chevy chief told reporters ahead of the relaunch. “What happened in the segment was there wasn’t a lot of choice.”Research firm IHS Automotive, however, does not see sales as strong as GM does, predicting 100,000 annually in the U.S. market from the Colorado and Canyon combined.“The gap in pricing between Silverado and Colorado will be key,�� IHS senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. “If price gets too close or fuel economy is not better by at least five to six miles per gallon on the highway, that will hurt the Colorado.“The real question is how many people are really sitting in small crossovers wishing they had trucks,�� she added. “We don’t know the answer, but GM is betting on that.”It may be difficult to imagine in a market where full-sized trucks like Silverado, Ford’s F-150 and Chrysler’s Ram dominate television ads with images of brawny, haul-anything usefulness, but the mid-sized trucks once rivaled their larger siblings.In 1994, U.S. sales of the smaller pickups topped out at almost 1.2 million vehicles, or 8 percent of the market, compared with more than 1.6 million, or 10.7 percent of the market, for the full-size trucks. Last year, however, small pickups, mostly the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier, accounted for fewer than 280,000 sales, or 1.9 percent of the market, while the bigger trucks made up more than 11 percent.Industry sales in the U.S. mid-sized truck market fell 7.5 percent last year and are expected to slide another 12.7 percent this year, but rebound to almost 395,000 vehicles in 2020, according to research firm LMC Automotive.GM is betting the Colorado can top its peak U.S. sales year with demand coming not only from existing players in the mid-sized truck segment, but from the larger trucks of its rivals as well as crossover buyers looking for something different.Competitors are watching. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T claims GM's re-entry will only boost the segment and sales of its market-leading Tacoma.Bill Fay, group vice president for Toyota’s U.S. sales, said they have been anticipating the Colorado’s return. “More entries create more shoppers. A lot of that will make some people come take a look at Tacoma,�� he added.Fay said Toyota remains committed to the segment and he sees sales of Tacoma, last redesigned in 2004, rising over the next several years from the 141,000-plus sold last year. He agreed, however, that Toyota will likely need to increase advertising for its truck ahead of Colorado’s debut.Meanwhile, Ford shows no signs of swerving from its strategy of maximizing sales of the F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. market for more than three decades. Ford and Chrysler stopped making their mid-sized trucks, the Ranger and Dakota respectively, in 2011.“I’m not exactly sure what they see that we’re not seeing.�� Doug Scott, Ford’s truck group marketing manager, said of GM. “We’ll just have to see how things play out.”Ford officials added they have no plans to bring the Ranger, still sold overseas, back to the U.S. market as the proximity of that vehicle’s size to the full-size F-150 makes it unnecessary. They also said the smaller pickups appealed in the early 1990s partly as an option to entry-level cars because the trucks could be purchased with sub-$100 monthly leases. That is no longer true.Instead, Ford is boosting efforts to broaden its F-150 lineup. For instance, the sportier STX version, meant to appeal to younger buyers - launched as a distinct model in 2009 - is expected to make up 17 percent of the truck’s sales mix over the next year, up from 3 percent in the 2012 model year, Scott said.Colorado’s starting price the last time around was $18,285, and while it has not revealed what it will now be, the lack of a regular cab model suggests it could be higher. However, the Detroit automaker has to be careful to keep it separate from the larger Silverado, which starts at $26,670. Ford’s F-150 starts at $25,640.GM executives feel they made the new Colorado different enough from Silverado. A comparable crew cab version of Colorado is 900 pounds lighter, 16 inches shorter, 5 inches narrower and 3 inches lower. It will be offered with 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, and V6 engines in the first year, with a diesel engine added in the second year.	-5.791352638
(Adds detail)PARIS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - French car registrations rose 3.9 percent in January, the country’s main auto industry body said on Monday, as Volkswagen appeared to shrug off the scandal over its diesel test-rigging, outpacing Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen.Sales rose to 138,395 cars, the Paris-based CCFA said in a statement. Adjusted for selling days, of which there was one fewer last month than in January 2015, the gain was bigger.The data offers some cheer to Volkswagen as it continues to face repercussions from the exposure of its U.S. emissions test-rigging.Following a run of slower sales in the wake of the scandal, which broke in September, the German group’s registrations picked up by 12 percent in January, based on CCFA data to Jan. 29, with the core VW brand up 5.5 percent.That contrasted with a 3.2 percent gain for PSA and a 2.9 percent decline for Renault group in the same period, despite recent model launches including the Renault Kadjar compact SUV.France’s domestic brands also lagged behind foreign rivals Toyota, up 11.6 percent, and Fiat Chrysler, which gained 8.4 percent. A buoyant performance by Opel-Vauxhall helped parent General Motors record a 19 percent French sales gain.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean imports of Japanese beer slumped 45% in July from the previous month in the wake of a consumer boycott sparked by an escalating political and economic dispute between the two Asian neighbors, data showed.The plunge is good news for rival importers and South Korean brewers but is a worrying sign for Japanese exporters like Asahi Group Holdings 2502.T, which said last week the boycott was affecting sales and lowered its profit guidance.Japan shipped $4.3 million worth of beer to South Korea in July, down from $6.6 million a year earlier and $7.9 million in June, according to preliminary customs office data provided by lawmaker Kim Jung-woo to Reuters.Japan tightened export controls last month for materials used to make chips, South Korea’s top export item, intensifying a row over wartime forced labor and sparking a consumer backlash in Korea.Many Korean supermarkets and convenience stores have removed Japanese items such as beer from their stands and stopped new orders.South Korea buys 61% of Japan’s beer exports, spending 7.9 billion yen ($73 million) in 2018 on the shipments, according to Japan’s finance ministry.Korea’s imports of Japanese beer declined 11% in the first half from a year earlier, after nearly quadrupling over the past three years in 2018, according to customs data.Overall, imported beers such as Asahi and Heineken have eroded the dominance of domestic beers in recent years, but they are likely to fall from their peak due to the boycott of Japanese products, an official at a South Korean brewer said.“Both domestic and other imported beers are expected to share the benefits from the boycott campaign,�� he said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.Japanese automakers such as Toyota 7203.T and Honda 7267.T are bracing for further sales drops in South Korea in the coming months, after they posted sharp sales declines last month. A slew of South Korean airlines are also suspending flights to Japan as they brace for a dwindling number of tourists.	2.987053502
MOSCOW, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Foreign carmakers in Russia are looking to ramp up production and export locally-made vehicles to compensate for plunging domestic sales, having taken steps to reduce their dependence on costly imported parts.After a decade of annual sales growth in excess of 10 percent, the Russian car industry has become a casualty of an economic crisis fuelled by lower oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukranian conflict.While some foreign carmakers like U.S. General Motors Co have quit Russia, stung by a low level of local manufacturing, others are intent on riding out the storm and even ramping up production for the export market.Volkswagen, Ford, Nissan and Renault all told Reuters they were considering increasing exports from Russia, though no final decisions had been made.Pursuing exports is an unusual strategy in a country which depends on costly imported parts and whose neighbouring economies are also struggling.“It’s a mark of desperation,�� said IHS Automotive analyst Tim Urquhart.“They’ve got factories that are running at very low capacity levels,�� he said. “They’ve got to try and come up with ways to improve the ... economic rationale of those plants.”A weaker rouble should make exports more lucrative as costs fall in the local currency, but the benefits are reduced by the country’s reliance on imported car parts which leaves Russian producers uncompetitive against rivals manufacturing in Asia and Europe, who source components at home.“The logistical costs and import tariffs will completely offset any savings in labour costs or from using Russian components,�� said one industry source. “It renders exports unprofitable.”Even market leader Avtovaz, which produces the best-selling Lada brand, purchases around 20 percent of components abroad.Volkswagen and Ford both opened new engine plants in Russia earlier this month in an effort to reduce the costs incurred from importing more than half of all parts used to assemble their cars in the country. .Yet Russia’s economic turmoil has also hit its traditional overseas market, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).Auto exports to CIS nations from Russia fell 26 percent year-on-year to 54,800 vehicles in the first 7 months of 2015, customs data showed, while total sales abroad dropped to 58,200, down 25 percent.“The CIS markets have never been big,�� said another industry source. “Now they are heading to the bottom together with the Russians.”Car makers are looking further afield for potential sales.South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co said in August it will send more than 4,000 cars from its St. Petersburg plant to Egypt and Lebanon by the end of the year.The first industry source said Toyota, which currently ships to Belarus and Kazakhstan from Russia and plans to double its local output to 100,000 vehicles in 2015, was contemplating exports to European countries.Toyota declined to comment on its plans.“Given the fall in domestic demand, the importance of exports is increasing,�� said a Renault spokeswoman. “We are exploring options to expand our export geography. One of the potential destinations is Vietnam.�� (Writing by Jack Stubbs; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)	8.774518313
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Saturday its operations near the Chinese port of Tianjin will remain shut at least through Wednesday due to safety concerns as fires continue to break out at the site of last week's deadly chemical explosions.“We will only restart operations when we have been able to confirm the safety of our facilities and their surroundings, and when our employees feel that they can once again go to work in a safe environment,�� the company said in an email.Toyota also said about 4,700 Toyota and Lexus vehicles were damaged by the Tianjin disaster. It will not sell these cars, which have dents and broken windows, it said.The move to prolong the closure comes as continuing safety hazards cast doubts on when operations can resume in the area.Toyota’s Tianjin operations were originally set to be closed through Wednesday last week but that was then extended through Saturday. The automaker operates two assembly lines near the Tianjin port and another line in a different part of the city.Toyota also said Sichuan FAS Toyota Motor Co Ltd, a joint venture, began operating its Changchun plant on Saturday as planned to make up for lost output. The plant in northeast China was closed through Friday because damages at the port had delayed custom clearance of parts shipped from Japan.	3.576462297
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it will begin building a new version of the Corolla sedan in Brazil that will run on electricity, ethanol and gas, which it says will be the first vehicle of its kind in the world.Brazil, which is South America’s largest auto producer, has largely resisted the shift toward electric and hybrid vehicle production that has swept through more developed markets.Some of Toyota’s competitors in Brazil, including General Motors and Volkswagen AG , have said they will import electric vehicles but do not plan to produce them domestically.The announcement was made in a news conference hosted by Sao Paulo state governor Joao Doria. Toyota said the car will be produced in the state, at its Indaiatuba plant, which will receive an investment of 1 billion reais ($254.73 million).Toyota said in a statement that it made the decision to build the Corolla in Brazil in part thanks to a package of tax incentives passed by the country’s Congress, known as Rota 2030. Unlike in most markets around the world, ethanol is a common car fuel in Brazil.Toyota already imports the hybrid Prius to Brazil.	-5.632790029
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and its Chinese joint venture partner sold 1.25 million vehicles in China in 2015, up 6.3 percent from the previous year, the Japanese car maker said on Wednesday.In December, Nissan sold 159,100 vehicles, up 15 percent from a year earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor and Hino Motors are joining a venture of SoftBank Corp and Toyota Motor that will develop self-driving car services in Japan, as alliances between automakers and tech firms broaden.Under an agreement, Honda and truck maker Hino, in which Toyota owns a majority stake, would each invest around 250 million yen ($2.27 million) in the joint venture, Monet Technologies, and take 10 percent stakes in the venture, Monet said on Thursday.Tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp’s domestic telco and Toyota formed the venture last year. It will foray in the ride-sharing sphere that is dominated by startups such as Uber, Didi Chuxing and Lyft.Honda and Hino’s participation in the venture highlights the challenges facing automakers in developing new transportation services as the rise of self-driving cars could threaten vehicle sales in the future with users seen opting for pay-per-use services over car ownership.It is also the latest example in the growing trend of consolidation among automakers and technology and communications companies as they grapple with the massive investment and software expertise required to develop new services for which demand has yet to be tested.“The more automakers we can get to join the partnership, the smarter we can make our platform,�� Junichi Miyakawa, chief executive of Monet and chief technology officer of SoftBank Corp said at an event to promote the venture.The new investment from Honda and Hino would leave SoftBank with a 40.2 percent stake in Monet, down from just over 50 percent when the venture was formed. Toyota will hold a 39.8 percent stake.Toyota President Akio Toyoda said that increased cooperation between automakers and companies in other sectors would help make the mobility services industry more transparent.With the participation of Honda and Hino, “the auto world has taken a big step towards openness��, he said at the event.Honda’s investment in Monet will be its latest in new mobility services after it invested $2.75 billion for a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co’s Cruise self-driving vehicle unit last year.The Japanese automaker, which has lagged many of its rivals in developing self-driving cars, is also an investor in Southeast Asian ride-hailing service Grab. SoftBank also invests in Cruise and Grab.The latest investment in Monet values the venture at just $22.7 million, for now making it a miniscule player compared with Cruise, which is valued at around $15 billion, and Uber, which has been valued at around $120 billion ahead of its expected IPO.For now the size of the venture is “insignificant compared with SoftBank Corp’s enterprise value,�� said Dan Baker, analyst at Morningstar. The telco is looking to diversify beyond its core cash-generative wireless business amid pressure on carrier fees.SoftBank Group and its $100 billion Vision Fund are already a major player in ride sharing. Founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son says his portfolio companies, which include Uber, Didi, Grab and Ola, control 90 percent of the industry.Monet plans to roll out on-demand bus and car services in Japan in the next year, and a platform to operate self-driving vehicles as early as 2023 based on Toyota’s “e-palette��, a boxy multi-purpose vehicle which can be used for on-demand mobile shops, offices and other services.It plans to leverage data compiled from mobile phone users, including user location, and data on steering, braking and vehicle surroundings collected from Toyota cars to create a domestic platform to transport people and goods, along with mobile shops, restaurants and public facilities.Monet also said it had formed a consortium of 88 Japanese companies including Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan, beverage maker Suntory Holdings Ltdand Yahoo Japan Corp to collaborate on projects, which could include product delivery or product-related services.	3.9808516
* Honda, Mazda target around 10 pct sales rise in 2015* Overall sales down about 17 pct as of end-May* Consumers delaying purchases as economy deterioratesJAKARTA, July 14 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are sticking to their targets in Indonesia in defiance of the longest sales decline in six years, resorting to steep discounts to entice tight-spending consumers into showrooms that remain stubbornly empty.Honda Motor Co Ltd, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Mazda Motor Corp aim to sell more cars this year than last, though overall sales to distributors have fallen each month since September and are down 17 percent in 2015.“The decline is pretty drastic,�� said dealership salesman Jonatan, whose monthly average sales of Toyota Motor Corp cars was four versus eight last year. “We certainly have to work extra hard to sell cars these days.”Auto sales are a key indicator of consumption in Indonesia, where the economy is growing at its slowest since 2009, and where 7 percent inflation is eroding purchasing power. Consumers are consequently reserving more money for primary needs, the central bank said last month.In response, automotive industry association Gaikindo in June lowered its sales forecast for this year to a range of 1 million to 1.1 million vehicles from 1.2 million.“We are struggling with the market slowdown,�� said PT Honda Prospect Motor director Jonfis Fandy.The firm has been trying to boost sales since early in the year via promotions usually reserved for Indonesia’s annual automotive exhibition in August, to meet Honda’s target sales increase of 10 percent.Promotions include discounts on down payments, low-interest loans, and extending instalment periods to seven years from around four. Honda has sold 1.4 percent more cars as of end-May.At Mazda, which aims to sell 9 percent more cars, one customer said he was offered 11 percent off a 450 million rupiah ($33,860.05) sports utility vehicle. But the mid-30s communication manager still delayed purchase for six months as economic conditions made him worry about finances.Astrid Ariani Wijaya, senior marketing manager at PT Mazda Motor Indonesia - for whom year-to-date sales figures are unavailable - said the slowdown is affecting all industries, not just auto.“What we are doing is maintaining advertising consistency in mass media,�� she said. “Discounts would depend on the model, and each dealer has different stocks.”Inflation and a weak rupiah are keeping the benchmark interest rate high at 7.5 percent, so the central bank is trying to boost demand by easing the passenger car down payment requirement to 25 percent from 30 percent.“Willingness to spend money on big purchases is not there,�� said BNI Securities analyst Thendra Crisnanda. “So I doubt the down payment easing will be a significant help.”Auto demand usually peaks before Indonesia’s Lebaran holiday in mid-July as consumers buy cars to visit home towns, but this year it is far less than expected, Crisnanda said.At Toyota, one dealership salesman said supplies had fallen for its most popular multi-purpose vehicle, the Avanza.Rahmat Samulo, a director at PT Toyota Astra Motor, said the company is making supply-demand adjustments and that, “if the stock is enough, we are not going to add excessively.”Toyota has sold 25 percent fewer cars as of end-May. It declined to disclose its 2015 target, but said it aims to maintain its market share of around 33 percent.Japan’s top automaker opened its second local plant in 2013, will open an engine factory next year, and plans to invest further in the country. Despite the slowdown, investment plans are “still on track��, an official at PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia told Reuters.At Nissan, where sales are down 22 percent, its two local factories are running at 40 percent capacity, and have inventory turnover of about two months versus less than one month “during good days��, Trimegah Securities said in a June report.PT Nissan Motor Indonesia president director Steve Ardianto did not comment on production. But he said the firm is offering variants of current models, adding dealerships and improving service to lift its 2015 share to 6 percent from 4.7 percent.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Carmakers are gearing up to launch affordable hybrid and electric cars for India in the next few years, executives said, lured by government incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles as the country accelerates efforts to cut worsening air pollution.As the industry descends on smog-bound New Delhi for India’s biggest car show, starting Wednesday, foreign firms like Toyota Motor Corp will join domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra in displaying green cars designed to reel in potential buyers.The stakes are high in one of the fastest-growing car markets in the world. While hybrid and electric cars now make up a tiny fraction of sales, new government aid worth up to $2,000 per car could help catapult green vehicles to nearly a third of a 5 million car market by 2020, IHS Automotive says.“It is not enough to just introduce new technology in India, you have to make it relevant for the market and the buyers,�� said C.V. Raman, head of engineering at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India’s top-selling carmaker.India’s rampant pollution has forced the government’s hand. The Supreme Court last month ordered an overnight temporary ban on the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi, among the world’s most polluted cities.Carmakers were left jittery, many having invested heavily in comparatively cheap diesel technology over the years to conquer India.Reliance on imported parts still makes full-scale hybrid technology cars expensive, but with India’s new sales incentives, ��semi-hybrid�� technology is seen as a potential longer term solution.To incentivise carmakers, the government introduced a scheme last year called FAME - Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric cars - that offers concessions of up to 138,000 rupees ($2,032) on the sale of such cars.The scheme, introduced before the New Delhi court order and originally planned for two years, will now likely be extended till 2020.To be sure, some carmakers, like General Motors Co, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, are yet to be convinced on hybrid technology potential in India. Instead, they will focus their presence at the New Delhi auto show on gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles.Toyota is among those now looking at bringing in a hybrid variant for future models, as well as cars it now sells in India, which is also moving towards stricter emission norms.“Our strategy is to go for hybridisation,�� said Naomi Ishii, head of Toyota’s India unit. Ishii did not give a specific timeline, but said the Japanese carmaker will first bring hybrid in for its top-end models and then in the mass segment, mainly because of the high cost of imported components.Meanwhile Maruti, majority-owned by Suzuki Motor Corp, has already invested in developing a low-cost version of hybrid technology, irrespective of government incentives. Maruti says the technology combines fuel efficiency and lower emissions, but is not as expensive as existing traditional hybrid technology.($1 = 67.92 rupees)	-11.13787375
(Adds Toyota results; analyst comment)TORONTO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Major automakers reported their best ever Canadian sales performance last year, with Ford Motor Co holding on to the top sales spot for 2014, despite a late surge by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Canadian unit.Chrysler Canada sold 21,613 cars and trucks in December, 40 percent more than a year earlier and wrapped up the best unit sales year in its 90-year history. Chrysler’s sales beat Ford’s in October and November.Even so, Ford was the country’s top-selling automaker for the fifth straight year. Its sales jumped 40 percent to 22,640 for December and rose 3 percent to 291,951 for the full year. Chrysler’s 2014 sales increased 12 percent to 290,004.“The battle for best-selling vehicle company remained tight all year,�� DesRosiers Automotive Consultants said in a note to clients. “Ford moved into the number one position in September and didn’t look back.”DesRosiers said the 1.85 million vehicles sold in Canada topped the previous record from 2013 by more than 100,000.The news came as automakers reported strong U.S. sales for December, boosted by falling gasoline prices, but executives cautioned that growth could slow in 2015 after five years of recovery from the recession.General Motors Co’s Canadian unit sold 13 percent more vehicles in December than a year earlier, and full-year sales rose 6.3 percent to take third spot.Toyota Motor Corp’s Canadian unit was fourth, up 2.8 percent at 200,851. In December, it barely improved on a year ago, notching truck sales gains that offset a slip in car sales.Seven manufacturers - Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd - sold more than 100,000 vehicles in Canada in 2014.GM Canada sold 19,247 vehicles in December and 249,800 over the full year. Car sales jumped 22.9 percent in December, and truck sales rose 9.1 percent. The full-year sales gains were more evenly split, with a 6.5 percent increase for cars and 6.2 percent for trucks.Sales of Ford’s popular F-Series pickup trucks rose 37 percent for December as the 2015 F-150 went on sale. Trucks made up nearly 80 percent of Ford’s Canadian sales in 2014.Chrysler’s full-year results benefited in part from the Jeep Cherokee SUV, whose sales rose more than 600 percent from 2013. The key model started shipping in October 2013, replacing the discontinued Liberty. Overall, Jeep sales rose more than 50 percent.

"JAKARTA/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Honda Motor's 7267.T Mobilio, a spacious yet affordable multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), has nearly doubled its market share this year, triggering a price war with Toyota Motor 7203.T in Indonesia, the latest battleground for global carmakers.Toyota and its Daihatsu Motor 7262.T affiliate have long enjoyed a more than 50 percent market share in Indonesia - where car ownership is less than 4 percent in a population of close to 250 million. This emerging market with a growing middle-class keen to upgrade to four wheels from two, is a key target for global carmakers facing slowing demand in the United States and Europe.For much of the past decade Toyota and Daihatsu were alone in offering the lower-range MPVs - dubbed 'people movers' locally - that are popular among family-oriented Indonesians. That market grip has seen off attempts by General Motors GM.N, Nissan Motor 7201.T and others to dethrone them.But the Mobilio, a 7-seat MPV with a starting price of around $13,500, is now proving a serious challenger, with sales of about 67,000 since its January launch, driving the company's Indonesian market share up to 13.6 percent. Toyota Group's market share has dropped to 48.7 percent at end-September from above 54 percent five years ago, according to data from their distributor PT Astra International ASII.JK.Lower-range MPVs, including Toyota's Avanza and the Daihatsu Xenia, make up over a third of industry sales in Indonesia, says Davy Tuilan, marketing director of PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales, a unit of Japanese rival Suzuki Motor 7269.T.“The Indonesian market is now more open, because everybody is ready with a product line-up in low-cost green cars (LCGCs) and the low MPV segment,�� he said. LCGCs are a special category in Indonesia that qualify for some tax breaks.“LOOKS EXPENSIVE”Mobilio drivers say the compact MPV is priced competitively, has a sleek design and offers more room than its rivals.“It’s very different from other family cars. To us, it looks like an expensive car, while it’s very affordable,�� said Mirza Ayu, who lives with her parents and brother near the capital, Jakarta. The family bought a Mobilio in June to replace their 5-year-old Avanza.The Mobilio’s success also suggests Toyota may have become complacent in a market it has long dominated.“Others have come out with more updated products, new products and I think Toyota has been a little lazy in introducing new models,�� said Mohit Arora, vice president at research firm JD Power Asia Pacific, referring to MPVs.At a Honda dealership in Jakarta where the Mobilio accounts for around 60 percent of total sales, sales executive Agung Suriza said: “The Mobilio’s exterior is fresher than its Toyota and Daihatsu competitors. The design of the Xenia and Avanza hasn’t changed much for a long time.”A Toyota spokeswoman in Singapore said the group - Toyota, Daihatsu and Hino Motors 7205.T - ""sees increasing competition in Indonesia in a positive way, as a challenge to improve our products and services and to achieve higher standards in fulfilling our customers' needs.""To protect its market position, Toyota said it would improve localisation - sourcing more in Indonesia - and strengthen its sales and service network. A Toyota engineer said the company was also working on giving the Avanza a facelift as early as next year, without elaborating.Automakers have responded to the competition with discounts.The Avanza is being discounted by up to 10 percent, or $1,250-$1,330, dealers said - around a 50 percent increase on last year’s discount and pushing its price into a lower bracket with the Xenia, which has seen sales drop by a third so far this year.“Last year’s discount was lower, but logically if there’s competition we take some steps,�� said one Toyota dealer.“No one’s buying Xenia,�� acknowledged a senior Daihatsu executive in Osaka. Daihatsu’s cheapest car in Indonesia starts at about $6,500. “If Suzuki began selling a car like the Alto in Indonesia, we’d be dead-meat,�� the executive added.Suzuki sells its Alto hatchback in India, one of its main markets, where the model is among its cheapest at a starting price of about $4,500.Koji Endo, Tokyo-based analyst with Advanced Research Japan, reckons Toyota and Daihatsu need to introduce a couple of models that are cheaper than those from Honda and others if they want to protect their market share.“I think it’s probably very difficult for Toyota-Daihatsu to keep 50 percent market share. Maybe 50 will decline to 45 or 40 in the next five years,�� predicted Endo. Indonesia contributed about 17 percent of Daihatsu’s global sales in the year to March.Honda did not respond to requests for comment, though Jonfis Fandy, marketing director at Honda Prospect Motors, attributed the Mobilio’s popularity to its exterior design, power-to-fuel ratio, roomy interior and safety features. “The Mobilio has been designed mostly to accommodate Indonesian customers�� needs,�� he said, adding Honda plans to expand the number of its dealers by 50 percent to more than 150 in the next couple of years.Competition in Indonesia is set to intensify as automakers build or expand capacity there. Mitsubishi Motors 7211.T said last month it would invest $600 million in a plant to make MPVs. The industry association predicts car sales will rise 10 percent a year for five years from 2015, boosted in part by government promotion of LCGCs. Industry sales increased 2.7 percent from last year in January-September."	6.069338922
TORRANCE, CA, April 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s decision to move its North American sales headquarters from California to Texas was met by disbelief in Torrance, this Los Angeles exurb where the Japanese car manufacturer has run its U.S. operations since 1982.Torrance Mayor Frank Scotto, looking grim, said outside city hall on Monday that he had been blindsided by the move. A few feet away sat Pat Simpson, a Torrance resident for over 60 years, with her head in her hands. “Why do they want to tear this place apart?�� Simpson, 72, asked.Scotto said his first inkling of Toyota’s decision to move to Plano, Texas, came last Thursday, when he was told by Toyota to expect a phone call at 9.45 a.m. on Monday - just before the company was to make its decision official.“At first I thought it was about something else,�� Scotto said. “Even this morning, despite all the rumors this weekend, we thought it was only going to be part of Toyota moving - not just everything.�� The decision, he said, was “sad news��.The two biggest employers in Torrance, which has a population of 147,000 according to city figures, are Toyota and Honda. Both have about 4,000 employees. Losing Toyota will mean an annual loss of $1.2 million in tax revenue, Scotto said, but the emotional toll and wider economic impact will be much bigger, he said.Scotto’s son-in-law works for Toyota so the mayor faces the prospect of his daughter and grandchildren moving to Texas. “It’s going to affect tens of thousands of people,�� he said.About five percent of the city’s workforce is employed by Toyota. Last year the city had an annual budget of $271 million, and $121 million of long-term debt.Scotto, mayor since 2006, thanked Toyota for all it had contributed to the city, including a recent $500,000 donation to help build a new sports complex a few blocks from city hall. Scotto said it is to be called the Toyota Sports Complex, although the sign hasn’t been put up yet.As he spoke to reporters and a small crowd of residents, his words were interrupted by the sound of breaking glass and crunching metal from an auto accident 50 feet away. It was that kind of morning in Torrance.Whether the city can replace Toyota, and fill the 101-acre business park and headquarters it will leave behind, remains to be seen. Scotto said the city had a short list of companies similar to Toyota that are being courted to replace the Japanese car maker.But conceding that the battle to keep Toyota was lost before it had even begun - “the train has already left the station,�� Scotto said - he also said it takes the state of California, not a small city such as Torrance, to stop large manufacturers from leaving the Golden State.Frank Portillo, a co-owner of Los Chilaquiles Mexican Grill next to the Toyota headquarters said he did not blame Toyota, although he might lose business himself. “The taxes are lower in Texas. There are fewer regulations. It’s cheaper for a company there. Why wouldn’t they leave California?�� (Reporting by Tim Reid, editing by John Pickering)	3.711627907
(Corrects timing in third paragraph to say ‘in the future�� and not ‘by 2017��)MANILA, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp’s Philippines unit will invest 4.3 billion Philippine pesos ($91 million) to boost production from next year and take advantage of an incentive programme, its chairman said on Wednesday.Mitsubishi Motors Philippines Corp will start making the sedan model of the Mirage in 2017 which should raise production to 30,000 from 18,000, Osamu Masuko told a media briefing.The Japanese automaker will double its production capacity to 100,000 vehicles per year in the future, Masuko said.Mitsubishi already manufactures the Adventure SUV and L300 van in the Philippines. Its facility, south of the capital, has an annual capacity of 50,000 units and output was around 16,000 vehiclse last year, company data showed.The Philippines�� long-awaited $600 million incentive programme requires automakers to produce at least 200,000 vehicles per model over six years to avail of tax breaks.Mitsubishi sells the most cars in the Philippines after Toyota Motor Corp, which has also said it was keen to take part of the scheme aimed at expanding the local auto industry.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Power had been restored to almost all customers in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido by early Saturday, two days after an earthquake caused an island-wide blackout and killed at least 21 people.But the impact of Thursday’s 6.7 magnitude quake was set to rumble on with Toyota Motor planning to halt operations at 16 of 18 domestic full-assembly plants due to a parts factory shutdown.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the confirmed death toll was 21, with six people in cardiopulmonary arrest - a term used in Japan to describe a victim’s condition before death is officially confirmed - and 13 people were missing.The earthquake triggered landslides that buried houses and paralyzed Hokkaido with widespread power and transport cuts, the latest natural disaster to hit Japan after typhoons, floods and deadly heat waves in the past two months.Toyota Motor said it would suspend work at the 16 plants on Monday due to the shutdown of its transmission factory in Tomakomai in Hokkaido following the quake.The company said it would decide later on whether to extend the shutdowns beyond Monday.Suga called on businesses and Hokkaido’s 5.3 million residents to save power by about 10 percent from Monday, when usage rises, and said the government would likely resort to rolling blackouts if demand threatened to exceed supply capacity.That would be the first use of rolling blackouts in Japan to deal with power shortages since March 2011, when a magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster.Hokkaido Electric said power supplies had been restored island-wide to 2.93 million customers by early Saturday, leaving only 20,000 customers without electricity.The utility will have supplies of up to 3.6 GW available by the end of Saturday, the trade ministry said, which is still short of pre-quake peak demand of 3.8 GW.Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co is preparing to resume truck product shipments at its 150,000 barrels-per-day Hokkaido refinery, a company official said.Refining operations have been halted since Thursday.	2.131230072
TOKYO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp raised its annual net profit forecast by more than 10 percent to 860 billion yen ($9.3 billion) on strong sales of the Camry sedan and other vehicles in its biggest market the United States, as well as the yen’s drop.The world’s biggest-selling carmaker posted a net profit of 99.9 billion yen for the three months to Dec. 31, up 23.5 percent from a year ago when it struggled after natural disasters disrupted its supply chain.Its third-quarter profit figure was below the average estimate of 143.7 billion yen among seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Among Japan’s big three automakers Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, analysts see top seller Toyota as the most likely to benefit from a weakening yen because it has the highest ratio of production in Japan, more than half of which it exports.The yen is trading at around 92 to the dollar, compared with 78 at the start of October. The weaker the Japanese currency, the more money exporters make when they convert overseas profits back into yen.In 2013, Toyota expects to sell 8.9 million vehicles globally. Across the group, which includes Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd, it forecasts shipping 9.91 million vehicles.Last year, the 75-year-old firm sold a record 8.72 million vehicles around the world. Its group-wide sales were also a record high of 9.75 million vehicles, beating General Motors to regain top rank among car manufacturers.Shares in Toyota have risen nearly 50 percent since mid-November on hopes the weakening yen will boost its bottom line.They closed at 4540 yen on Tuesday before results were announced, down 1.2 percent on the day.	4.450738418
(Reuters) - Denny Hamlin won the rain-shortened Toyota 500 at Darlington Raceway on Wednesday for the Joe Gibbs Racing driver’s second victory of the season in the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series.The 39-year-old was leading the field in the first Cup race on a Wednesday since 1984 when the rain came down with just under 25 laps to go in the 228-lap event.Drivers were told to enter the pit lane with 20 laps to go before NASCAR announced the decision to end the race.“I was pretty happy with how it all turned out,�� Hamlin, who also won the season-opening Daytona 500 in February, said.“I’ve got my happy face on, made sure I brought it with me today,�� he added, referring to his face mask which depicted a big smile.Hamlin’s 39th career win and third at the venue came with an element of fortune as he was running on worn tyres before the rain disruption as the team had run out of fresh ones.“It’s a driver’s race track. You can move around. You can do different things to make your car handle,�� Hamlin said. “We got it right today.”Hamlin’s team mate Kyle Busch, who spun Hendrick Motorsports driver Chase Elliott shortly before the storm, finished second followed by Kevin Harvick, Brad Keselowski and Erik Jones.The start of NASCAR’s second race without fans present following the COVID-19 disruption was delayed by 90 minutes due to rain. The action got underway after 10 track-drying Air Titan Toyotas were deployed.North America’s most popular motor sport returned to live racing from a two-month novel coronavirus-forced hiatus at the same venue on Sunday amid strict health, with Kevin Harvick claiming the 50th win of his career.	8.630775752
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday invoked emergency powers to require General Motors Co to build much-needed ventilators for coronavirus patients after he accused the largest U.S. automaker of “wasting time�� during negotiations.Trump, who has been on the defensive for not moving faster to compel the production of medical equipment, for the first time invoked the Defense Production Act, saying GM was not moving quickly enough even though earlier on Friday the largest U.S. automaker announced it would begin building ventilators in the coming weeks.Asked about negotiations with GM over ventilators, Trump expressed anger with the company’s decision to close an assembly plant in politically important Ohio. He also criticized GM’s prior decisions to build plants outside the United States.“I didn’t go into it with a favorable view,�� Trump told a news conference of the GM talks. White House adviser Peter Navarro said the administration ran into “roadblocks�� with GM this week.GM said in a statement in response to Trump that it has been working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems and GM suppliers “around the clock for over a week to meet this urgent need�� and said its commitment to Ventec’s ventilators “has never wavered.”The act grants the president power to expand industrial production of any key materials or products for national security and other reasons. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other Democrats have urged him to invoke the act, but the president had been reluctant to do so until now.Democratic U.S. Senator Ed Markey said, “About time. Now, tell us every day: which companies will be making more of this equipment, how much is being made, and where the equipment is going.”On Friday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States topped 100,000, the highest in the world according to a Reuters tally. The U.S. death toll topped 1,550. [L1N2BK21G]Trump also said countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy need ventilators and that if the excess volume is not needed, the United States can export them.Earlier, Trump lashed out at GM and Ford Motor Co for moving too slowly just hours before GM said it would build medical equipment at an Indiana plant.Trump criticized the U.S. automakers and said he expected the United States would make or obtain 100,000 additional ventilators within the next 100 days.The attack on the automakers coincided with rising tension between Trump and the Democratic governors of New York and Michigan, who have criticized the administration’s response to the COVID-19 epidemic. On Thursday evening, Trump questioned in an interview on the Fox News network whether New York state needed 30,000 ventilators to cope with rising numbers of coronavirus patients, as Cuomo had said.GM and Ford separately announced earlier this week they were working with medical equipment companies to help boost ventilator production.GM and its partner Ventec confirmed after Trump’s tweets that the No. 1 U.S. automaker would deploy 1,000 workers to build ventilators at its Kokomo, Indiana, parts plant and ship as soon as next month. It was aiming to build more than 10,000 per month with the ability to go higher. Suppliers in the effort were told the target was 200,000 ventilators.But early Friday, before GM issued its release, Trump attacked the automaker and Chief Executive Mary Barra on Twitter, reviving his grievance with Barra for closing and selling a car factory in Ohio, a state critical to the president’s re-election campaign.“General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!�� Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday.“They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed ventilators, ��very quickly��,�� Trump said on Twitter of GM and Ventec’s effort. “Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar.”Trump’s comments about GM and Ford came after a New York Times story Thursday suggested the White House had backed away from announcing a major ventilator deal with GM and Ventec because the price tag was too high. That drew criticism from Democrats.Following Trump’s tweets, Ford said it was moving as fast as it could to gear up its ventilator manufacturing efforts and was in “active conversations�� with the Trump administration seeking approvals. Ford said it has “teams working flat-out with GE Healthcare to boost production of simplified ventilators.”Other automakers have said they are working to produce ventilators, masks and other medical equipment.On Friday, Toyota Motor Corp said it was “finalizing agreements to begin working with at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity.”New York City Mayor Bill be Blasio on Friday said on Twitter that Tesla Inc had agreed to donate hundreds of ventilators to hospital intensive care units in New York City and the state of New York.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk in response said the electric carmaker was helping locate and deliver existing ventilators.Tesla on Friday did not respond to a request for comment on where it got the ventilators and whether the company was producing any ventilators of its own, something Musk has said the company will do.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) and Ferrari previously said they were exploring making ventilators in Italy.	-0.8145663632

* Subsidiary of Japanese automaker gets 32.5 pct royalty stake* Encana’s second deal with a Japanese firm in two months* Keeps developing field with less balance sheet riskCALGARY, Alberta, April 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Tsusho Corp , the Japanese trading company, will buy a stake in Encana Corp’s massive coalbed methane field in southern Alberta for C$602 million ($608 million).The deal, announced on Friday, is the latest installment in Canadian gas producer’s drive to get third parties to inject cash into its operations as prices for natural gas hit decade lows.Encana said Toyota Tsusho, one of the Toyota Motor Corp group of companies, paid C$100 million up front and will invest about C$502 million over seven years to buy a 32.5 percent royalty interest in the Horseshoe Canyon formation, where production is currently around 120 million cubic feet a day.It is the second such deal between a Japanese company and Canada’s largest gas producer in slightly more than two months. In February, Encana agreed to sell a 40 percent interest in British Columbia gas assets to Mitsubishi Corp for C$2.9 billion as a way to accelerate development, while protecting a balance sheet under pressure from low gas prices.Encana is hunting for partners to help fund development of a host of other assets as well, including up to five in the United States and Canada with potential for higher-value liquids-rich gas. Such deals could mean around US$2 billion in combined cash proceeds and carried development spending for the Calgary-based company, analysts have said.Under Friday’s deal, Toyota Tsusho will get an interest in 4,000 wells and 1,500 drilling locations on 480,000 net acres, which represent about a quarter of Encana’s coalbed methane acreage.Being a dry gas play, Encana had not devoted a large part of its 2012 capital spending to Horseshoe Canyon, spokeswoman Carol Howes said. Early this year the company stopped spending and even shut off some production in response to depressed prices.“These funds really allow us to maintain the ongoing program,�� Howes said.They are fee lands, meaning that Encana does not pay royalties to the provincial government on production.The region contains 480 billion cubic feet equivalent of proved plus probable gas reserves, Encana said.Toyota Tsusho said part of the attraction is that the Horseshoe Canyon wells do not produce water with the methane, reducing environmental concerns as well as extra processing costs.For Encana, the transaction is positive, but it will not have a major impact on its overall finances, CIBC World Markets analyst Andrew Potter said. He said in a research note that the price reflects a stronger natural gas price than today’s, especially since the production does not have medium-term liquefied natural gas potential such as assets in British Columbia.Encana shares were off 1 Canadian cent at C$17.99 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midday on Friday. They have lost about 14 percent of their value in the past month.	-3.436988543
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday the Trump administration has not ruled out imposing tariffs on imported autos, after letting a review period end in November with no action.“We’ve been having negotiations with the individual companies. We’ve had some very good benefits from that,�� Ross told Reuters in New York. “It may or may not turn out that there is any need for the tariff.”U.S. President Donald Trump did not announce any new tariffs after a six-month, self-imposed review period expired in mid-November following a Commerce Department “Section 232�� investigation into whether imported autos pose a national security threat. He has threatened to tax them by as much as 25%.Asked if there was a new deadline, Ross referred to a White House statement last month that did not include a new deadline.Auto experts have said the U.S. administration may have to find other means if Trump wants to tax European or Japanese car imports, a key part of Trump’s pledge to make America’s trade relationships more fair.Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, said Tuesday in response to Ross�� comments that the Commerce Department would need to a launch a new investigation before it could impose the tariffs.“VWs &amp; Toyotas don’t pose a nat’l security threat. The window to levy 232 tariffs on foreign autos is closed. If @CommerceGov wants to impose punitive taxes on Americans who buy foreign cars, they must launch a new investigation. Congress should reassert authority over 232 tariffs,�� Toomey wrote on Twitter.Ross said it was theoretically possible that Washington could use tariffs authorized by the World Trade Organization under a separate case over aircraft subsidies to impose tariffs on European car imports. But he declined to say if the administration was examining that possibility.Ross noted Tuesday the EU imposes a 10% tariff on U.S. cars, while the U.S. imposes a 2.5% tariff on EU cars.“There has already has been a tariff war. The only thing is we haven’t been defending ourselves. We’ve been accepting the lopsidedness of things,�� Ross said.	-1.834286511
"(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday they will delay restarting U.S. production amid the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about the automotive supply network.VW said it is indefinitely delaying the resumption of production at its Tennessee assembly plant that had been set to restart on May 3.Toyota said it will delay the resumption of North American manufacturing operations to the week of May 11 from the week of May 4 after an “extensive review with our supplier and logistics network.”The German automaker in a statement said that before it sets a new date it “will weigh the readiness of the supplier base, as well as market demand and the status of the COVID-19 outbreak.�� VW’s U.S. production has been suspended since March 21.Automakers had hoped to begin restarting production in early May but face hurdles including orders in key states like Michigan that limit non-essential business operations.Germany's BMW AG BMWG.DE said Wednesday it plans to restart work at its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant on Monday at about half the factory's capacity and then ""carefully ramp up production."" Detroit’s Big Three automakers have been in regular talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union on the conditions needed to resume production, but the companies not appear likely to resume U.S. production before May 18 at the earliest.UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the union continues to “have discussions about key health and safety issues and science that need to be in place for a restart.”No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co F.N said on Wednesday it still had no date to restart work at its North American plants, but scheduled a Thursday conference call to explain how it will protect its workers.Ohio on Monday outlined its plan, which included reopening the construction and manufacturing sectors on May 4.Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has not set a reopening date for manufacturing yet, and the UAW, which represents many hourly auto workers in Michigan and other states, has said early May is “too soon and too risky�� to reopen.On Wednesday, Whitmer said she is allowing the state’s construction sector to reopen on May 7, and emphasized worker safety was paramount.“Workplace safety cannot be an afterthought,�� she said at a press conference. “It’s an essential part of how we achieve a strong, vibrant economy.”Kristin Dziczek, vice president, Industry, Labor &amp; Economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, said to restart production there needs to be a tremendous orchestration and “synchronization�� across many different regions with different challenges like COVID-19 and different state orders on what is essential manufacturing."	2.314103083

TOKYO (Reuters) - Takata Corp's 7312.T resistance to a U.S. order to expand a recall of its air bag inflators is likely driven by a need to protect itself from legal liability, but risks longer-term business damage by alienating the public, experts say.Takata this week rejected a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) demand to declare its inflators defective and call in vehicles U.S.-wide for replacement. An existing recall is limited to a few hot and humid states. In a letter, Takata queried NHTSA’s justification for the order while a cause for why its inflators can erupt with excessive force is still unclear. The Japanese firm left it up to automakers to decide whether to expand the recall.“Takata’s approach reflects ignorance or denial of the reality that the court of public opinion can put you out of business long before a court of law decides about liability,�� said Jonathan Bernstein, president of California-based Bernstein Crisis Management.Takata’s response drew criticism from U.S. regulators and lawmakers. In Tokyo, government officials privately expressed shock and concern, with one bureaucrat saying it would be “disastrous�� for Takata to fight NHTSA’s demand as Japan frets about the broader reputational impact on its auto industry.Defective Takata air bag inflators, which can explode and shoot shrapnel into the car, have been linked to five deaths. More than 16 million cars have been recalled globally since 2008, the bulk by Takata's top customer Honda Motor Co 7267.T.Takata's approach is in contrast to Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T handling of a massive recall in early 2010. Toyota was slammed for its initial response to cases of unintended acceleration in its cars, but got back on track, providing something of a blueprint for how to steer through such crises.Toyota insiders said CEO Akio Toyoda was a driving force for transparency and accountability. “Akio gave me three requirements,�� Steve St Angelo, then Toyota’s quality chief in North America, told reporters in Japan recently.“First, never lie, even if it hurts Toyota; second, don’t blame anyone for our problems - not the government, the media, and certainly not the customer. And third, don’t ever, ever put the safety of our customers in jeopardy. If it’s black and white, you take fast action. If you’re not sure ... you (err) on the side of customers�� safety,�� he recalled.Crisis management experts say Takata’s top executives are wrong to not openly go public with what they are doing about the air bag inflator problems.Shigehisa Takada, Takata’s CEO and the third-generation head of the founding family, last appeared publicly at a closed-door shareholders�� meeting almost six months ago. His deputy, Stefan Stocker, has also kept a low profile, and Takata is represented at U.S. congressional hearings by Hiroshi Shimizu, a senior vice president with no executive title.People who have met Takada recently say he appeared to have little sense of crisis, believing the problem will blow over in time. [ID:nL3N0TI3IL]“Even though it’s a business-to-business company, there are consumers at the end of its products,�� said Hiroshi Osada, professor at Bunkyo University and member of an external panel that audited Toyota’s quality management during its 2010 crisis.“It’s unacceptable that top executives haven’t come forward yet. It speaks to the attitude they have towards this crisis.”Takata says senior executives have no immediate plans to hold a news conference, while lawyers have instructed its public relations staff to avoid meeting with journalists.	-4.386576765
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Friday shook up its top management, naming strategy chief Jim Farley as chief operating officer of the No. 2 U.S. automaker and promising skeptical investors the company will kick a slow-moving turnaround into a higher gear. Ford’s move positions Farley, 57, as potential heir to Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May 2017. Farley is currently president of new businesses, technology and strategy but will now be responsible for all global operations as well as future technology such as self-driving cars.News of Farley’s promotion and the retirement of automotive president Joe Hinrichs, another potential CEO candidate, effective on March 1, came three days after Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford saw its shares slide following a disappointing forecast. On Friday, Ford shares were off as much as 2.8% to their lowest price since January 2019 and finished the day down about 1.7 percent.Farley told Reuters that Ford needs to move more quickly, especially around taking advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its vehicles including commercial vehicles. Farley added that Ford was “deep�� in partnership talks with digital companies to improve its customer experience.“We put a lot of new cost and capability in these new vehicles,�� Farley said in a telephone interview. “We have to get a lot quicker in taking advantage of them. We do not have two or three years to figure out how we use connectivity in the F-150 and our new electric architecture that we launch later this year.”Ford is in the midst of a global restructuring and faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market. Hackett said on a conference call with reporters that the company needs to move with greater speed, echoing what some investors have said.“It’s my judgment the time is to move with urgency now to fully integrate and accelerate Ford’s transformation,�� Hackett said.“We’re now in execution mode and what the company needs is to come together,�� Hackett added, saying he had no plans to leave the company after almost three years on the job and it was the board’s role to manage succession.Analysts and investors have speculated how long Hackett, 64, will remain as CEO and whether an internal executive or an outsider will succeed him. Ford’s struggles, including a poor launch of its new Ford Explorer SUV and rising warranty costs, have only heightened speculation.Ford restructuring is far from complete. It said on Tuesday it has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.In China, Ford lost $771 million last year, about half the 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. Ford has been struggling to revive sales there since its business began slumping in late 2017, and now the world’s largest market has been hit by a fast-spreading coronavirus that has killed more than 630 people.Another key element for 2020 is Ford’s planned introduction of a fully redesigned F-150 full-sized pickup truck, its top profit generator, as well as the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV and the Ford Bronco utility vehicle.Farley joined Ford in 2007 as global head of marketing and sales and went on to lead Lincoln, South America, Ford of Europe and all of Ford's global markets in successive roles. He previously worked at Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.Farley is credited, along with Hackett, in forcing the redesign before its introduction of the Mach-E and the decision to make it a Mustang vehicle, leveraging that iconic brand. Farley has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old.	-13.08748584
(Adds commentary from auto analyst; figures for Toyota and other carmakers)MONTREAL, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales beat expectations in October, rising 5.1 percent compared with a record-setting October 2014, according to data compiled by DesRosiers Automotive Consultants on Tuesday.Total light vehicle sales rose to 163,053 cars and trucks, as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and General Motors Co reported higher Canadian sales for the month.Ford Motor Co reported roughly flat Canadian vehicle sales in October.“As we continue to close in on year end, setting a record year in 2015 is looking less like a possibility and more like a reality,�� DesRosiers wrote in a note.The data came as the U.S. auto industry is on track for a record year of annual sales, General Motors said on Tuesday. The top U.S. automaker and its rivals reported October sales that far exceeded expectations despite concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending and stagnant wages.In Canada, sales of most luxury brands hit double-digit growth, with Porsche AG reporting a 45.4 percent rise for the month in comparison with October 2014, DesRosiers wrote.Volkswagen AG reported 8.3 percent higher sales in Canada for the month despite the diesel emissions scandal which continues to rock the European carmaker, DesRosiers wrote. On Tuesday, Volkswagen said it found data “inconsistencies�� on carbon dioxide emissions for 800,000 more cars.GM Canada said its October sales under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands rose 5.5 percent to 23,268 vehicles.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four major automakers will not take a position on legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision to dramatically weaken Obama-era fuel economy standards but want to weigh in on any court fix, according to a document seen by Reuters.The Trump administration in March finalized rollback of U.S. vehicle emissions standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That is far weaker than the 5% annual increases in the discarded rules adopted under President Barack Obama.Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Honda Motor Co and BMW AG struck a voluntary agreement with California in July 2019 on vehicle emissions rules. On Monday, the four automakers plan to ask a U.S. Appeals Court in Washington for permission to be heard in the court challenge ""to ensure that any remedy imposed by this court is both appropriate and achievable,"" according to a draft of the filing.Last month, a group of 23 U.S. states led by California, as well as the District of Columbia and some major cities, challenged the Trump vehicle rule.Volkswagen said on Friday its “preference continues to be one set of national standards that’s achieved through an agreement between the federal government and California.”Other major automakers like General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Toyota Motor Corp have sided with the Trump administration on the rollback. Those companies also sided with the Trump administration in a separate lawsuit over whether the federal government can strip California of the right to set zero emission vehicle requirements.California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols told Reuters on Wednesday the board hopes to finalize the voluntary agreements in the “next few weeks�� as memorandums of understanding with the individual automakers."	0.5358972338

* Subaru maker Fuji Heavy raises full-year profit forecast 40 pct* Subaru output capacity topped up for sixth time in barely a year* Mazda also raises profit outlook to triple prior year’s result* Weak yen, popular models boost Japan’s second tier automakersBy Yoko KubotaTOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Fuji Heavy Industries bumped up its forecast for record profits this year by another 40 percent on Thursday and announced its sixth increase in production capacity in barely a year as it struggles to meet demand for its Subaru cars.Fuji Heavy, along with fellow second-tier Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp, is enjoying a rebound in the market but bumping up against capacity constraints that limit their ability to take full advantage.“We boosted capacity to match what we expected to sell, but it’s surpassed even that, faster than we’d ever imagined,�� Fuji Heavy’s chief executive Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said in a results briefing.Earlier the company announced that it expects to make an operating profit of 278 billion yen ($2.83 billion) in the current year ending next March, more than double last year’s result and up from its previous forecast of 198 billion yen.It also raised its global sales forecast for Subaru cars, about half of which are sold in the United States, by more than 10 percent to 807,300 vehicles, and said it would boost output at its main plant in Japan by another 20,000 vehicles a year - more than 10 percent - by next summer to meet demand.Meanwhile Mazda raised its full-year operating profit forecast by a third, to 160 billion yen, triple the year-ago result but still shy of a record, as it benefits from new versions of its key models, including the Mazda 3 and Mazda 6, which feature its latest fuel-efficient engine technology.Shares in both Fuji Heavy and Mazda are up by around 150 percent so far this year, outperforming those of the three biggest Japanese automakers - Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co which are variously up by between 20 and 60 percent.Profits at Fuji Heavy and Subaru have also been boosted by a weaker yen over the past year sparked by the reflationary policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.While the big Japanese automakers have moved most of their production for foreign markets overseas, spurred at first by trade frictions in the 1980s and more recently by the strong yen, their smaller rivals, each accounting for barely 1 percent of the global car industry’s total output, have continued to produce mostly in Japan and export to foreign markets.This battered their bottom line when the yen was strong but delivered a windfall with the recent weakness, generating more yen from currencies earned overseas.Mazda, which relies heavily on exports to Europe and other foreign markets, racked up $2.5 billion in combined net losses in the four consecutive financial years to March 2012, when the yen was strong.Subaru, which relies on the U.S. market for about half its sales, has fared better with a devoted following for its four-wheel-drive, boxer-engined vehicles and a marketing strategy focused on its biggest market.But the company is finding it increasingly difficult to keep pace with growing demand. Its volumes are still too low to justify a new plant, while its existing facilities are bursting at the seams.At its U.S. plant in Indiana, it makes 170,000 Subaru vehicles a year along with 100,000 Camry mid-sized cars for its biggest shareholder Toyota, the world’s largest automaker with forecast production this year of more than 9 million cars.Fuji Heavy plans to spend $400 million to boost capacity at the plant by another 130,000 vehicles, but that won’t be ready until the end of 2016.The Nikkei business paper said last week that Fuji Heavy would more than double its U.S. output by 2016, partly by discontinuing the Toyota Camry production, but Yoshinaga on Thursday said any such move would be up to Toyota.“Regarding Camry production, there have been some news reports but we ourselves have absolutely no desire to halt that,�� Yoshinaga said, while stressing the importance of the Toyota alliance for a small automaker like Fuji Heavy. “We get first-hand exposure to Toyota’s production methods, which is a good learning experience for us.��	-4.36189889
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers think U.S. President Donald Trump will again this week push back a self-imposed deadline on whether to put up to 25% tariffs on national security grounds on imported cars and parts from the European Union and Japan amid an ongoing trade war with China, five auto officials told Reuters.The anticipated delay -- expected to be announced later this week -- comes as foreign automakers are eager to highlight U.S. investments to try to dissuade Trump from using tariffs that they argue could cost U.S. jobs.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said earlier this month tariffs may not be necessary. EU officials expect Trump to announce a six-month delay when he faces a self-imposed deadline this week. Trump in May delayed a decision on tariffs by up to 180 days as he ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to pursue negotiations.Lighthizer’s office recently asked many foreign automakers to provide a tally of investments they have made in the United States, several auto industry officials told Reuters.The White House and Lighthizer’s office declined to comment.On Wednesday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican ally of Trump's, plans to attend a groundbreaking at Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE Chattanooga assembly plant where they will mark the beginning of an $800 million expansion to build electric vehicles and add 1,000 jobs. The high-profile event will also include remarks from Germany's ambassador to the United States.VW announced the plan to begin producing EVs by 2022 in Tennessee in January.Daimler AG said in late 2017 it planned to invest $1 billion to expand its manufacturing footprint around Tuscaloosa, Alabama, creating more than 600 jobs.Tariffs on Japan seem even less likely than the EU, experts say.Japanese automakers and suppliers have announced billions of dollars in investments, most notably a $1.6 billion joint venture plant in Alabama by Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp..Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a limited trade deal in September cutting tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products.Although the agreement does not cover trade in autos, Abe said in September he had received reassurance from Trump that the United States would not impose auto tariffs on national security grounds. Lighthizer said the two countries would tackle cars in negotiations expected to start next April.Stefan Mair, member of the executive board of the BDI German industry association, said a deal to permanently remove the threat of tariffs was needed. “The investments that are not being made are costing us the growth of tomorrow, even in sectors that are seemingly not affected,�� he said.Germany’s merchandise trade surplus with the United States - $69 billion in 2018 - remains a sore point with the Trump administration as does Japan’s $67.6 billion U.S. trade surplus last year -- with two-thirds of that in the auto sector.	-1.701715551
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The arrest of one of Mexico’s most notorious crime lords has offered a glimmer of hope to businesses in a central state whose emergence as an industrial powerhouse has been clouded by the bloody gang wars he waged there.The capture on Sunday of alleged drug trafficker and fuel thief Jose Antonio Yepez, alias “El Marro,�� has removed one of the two bosses battling for control of Guanajuato, a state once dominated by mining and agriculture but now bristling with carmaking operations.Turf wars between Yepez, leader of the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel of Nemesio Oseguera have sown chaos in Guanajuato, which could benefit from a new North American trade deal launched in July.Authorities say Yepez, 40, masterminded the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars of fuel in a state crisscrossed with pipelines and home to one of Mexico’s six oil refineries.“We all hope these kinds of crimes start to decrease, the perception of lawlessness diminishes, and that the business climate picks up,�� Jose Arturo Sanchez, head of the CCE business lobby in Leon, Guanajuato’s biggest city, said after the arrest.Guanajuato boasts plants of carmakers such as Toyota, General Motors, Honda and Mazda, but its automotive prowess has been increasingly overshadowed by gangland slayings since the government cracked down on El Marro’s fuel theft ring in late 2018.As illicit fuel sources dried up, his gang began to extort firms to secure extra revenues, a local businessman said.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has quarantined a community of 10,000 people near the capital, Hanoi, for 20 days because of fears the coronavirus could spread there, two local officials told Reuters on Thursday.The rural commune of Son Loi, in the northern Vietnameseprovince of Vinh Phuc, 44 km (27 miles) from Hanoi, is home toll of the 16 coronavirus cases in the Southeast Asian country,including a three-month-old baby.“Over 10,000 residents of the commune will not be permitted to leave for the next 20 days, starting from today,�� the second of the two the officials told Reuters on Thursday.“As of this evening, we will still allow those who wish to return home to enter but, in the next few days, this place will be totally be sealed,�� the official told Reuters by phone.Both officials declined to be identified citing the sensitivity of the situation.The coronavirus arrived in Vinh Phuc after people from the province who had been in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, returned home to Vietnam for the Lunar New Year holiday.The province is home to factories operated by Japan’s Honda and Toyota.On Wednesday, state media indicated that Vietnam’s Communist-ruled government could completely seal off the Son Loi commune.On the same day, a Reuters photographer could see checkpoints manned by police and marked by coronavirus warning signs already in place outside Son Loi. People were still allowed to enter and leave the commune, which has a population of 10,641, according to official data.Health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles at the checkpoints. Local authorities have set up shops and provided food and face masks for residents there, the first official said.“Everything is still under control,�� said the official. “We are trying very hard to stop the virus spreading to other areas and provinces.”Vietnam declared a public health emergency over the epidemic on Feb. 1 and banned all flights to and from China, where more than 1,300 people have died from the virus.The southeast Asia country has made plans to quarantine hundreds of Vietnamese citizens returning from China, including 950 at military camps outside Hanoi, and another 900 at temporary facilities on the Vietnam-China border.	-22.58294684
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Asian automakers are opening up a new front in the contest to define the future of cars in California, fielding a flock of cars powered by hydrogen in a bid to woo green car buyers from Tesla Motors Inc, the battery electric vehicle leader.Toyota, Honda and Hyundai used the opening days of the Los Angeles auto show, which draws thousands of car enthusiasts in one of the world’s richest vehicle markets, to tout new fuel-cell cars. These use hydrogen in a process that creates electricity but not carbon dioxide. Automakers plan to offer these cars in California, although the rollout will be limited.Hyundai says it has already leased its fuel-cell Tucson to about 85 customers, and Toyota says it has received expressions of interest from more than 2,000 people. Honda’s Clarity sedan will only be available in late 2016. Fuel-cell technology is expensive, and hydrogen fueling stations are still rare. Hyundai’s Tucson can be leased for $499 per month and sold only in Southern California, where there are about nine fueling stations.Toyota’s new Mirai can run for 300 miles between charges. Bill Fay, general manager for Toyota brand sales in the United States, told Reuters that a concerted public-private push is needed to build more refueling stations.“We need the government to support the investment in this and we hope that Honda and Hyundai will be coming in and provide some support,�� Fay said. “Then I think we have some critical mass to build from and take off from there.”California provides as much as $100 million a year to fund alternative fuel and vehicle projects, including hydrogen refueling stations.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and other Tesla executives have taken shots at fuel cells and the tax-funded subsidies used to promote them. Fuel cell vehicles compete with Tesla’s electric cars as generators of credits that could help conventional automakers meet California’s complex zero emission vehicle quotas.Tesla has benefited from, and repaid, government loans. It sells clean car credits. Tesla has also built its own recharging network.“Fuel cells are dependent on public infrastructure in a way electric vehicles will never be,�� Tesla’s vice president for business development, Diarmuid O’Connell, said Friday at an appearance before the Automotive Press Association. And because much of the hydrogen used in fuel cell vehicles will be derived from fossil fuels, he said, “fuel cell vehicles are not even zero emission vehicles.”Battery electric cars rely on an electric grid that in many regions of the United States is fueled by coal and gas, but O’Connell said the U.S. grid is getting cleaner.Public subsidies and regulations are the key forces driving the competition between fuel cell vehicles and battery electric vehicles in California, where state regulators have mandated that up to 16 percent of vehicles, or 1.5 million cars, sold in the state by 2025 be zero emission. Currently, about 2 percent of the vehicles sold in California are electric cars.Both fuel-cell cars and battery electric cars have limitations that discourage many would-be buyers.Most electric battery-powered cars on the market run for fewer than 100 miles between recharging stops. Tesla’s Model S sedan and Model X sport utility can run for more than 200 miles between charges, but the average Tesla sells for over $70,000.Low gas prices undermine demand for both technologies. Only about 67,700 electric vehicles were sold in the United States last year - about 0.4 percent of the 16.5 million new cars and trucks sold.“The electric car that has earned one dime for its maker hasn’t been created yet,�� said Johan de Nysschen, president of General Motors Co ��s Cadillac luxury brand, on the sidelines of the show.Still, GM plans a new electric Chevrolet model with a projected 200-mile range, and is experimenting with fuel cell technology.	1.411062732
* January registrations fall to 918,280 new cars* Slowest January since association’s records began in 1990* Hopes of H2 earnings recovery misplaced -analystsPARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Ford, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Toyota led European car sales to a new low in January, kicking off 2013 with an 8.5 percent decline, the Association of European Automakers said on Tuesday.Registrations fell to 918,280 new cars, the Brussels-based industry body said in a statement, the slowest January since its records began in 1990, as austerity measures and unemployment hit consumer spending.Ford, which is cutting back its European production capacity with three plant closures to stem regional losses, recorded a 26 percent sales plunge to 61,544 cars. Peugeot and Toyota posted the next biggest declines among major automakers, dropping 16 percent each.The slide “confirms a weak start to 2013��, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. “Hopes of an earnings and cash recovery in the second half are misplaced.”After falling to a 17-year low in 2012, European car demand is expected to contract further this year, squeezing mass-market brands still harder between excess capacity and cut-throat pricing. Most carmakers see the regional market shrinking between 3 and 5 percent in 2013.Tentative hints of a broader euro zone economic upturn have yet to percolate to the car industry.Germany in particular is weighing on the outlook. After resisting much of last year’s slump, Europe’s biggest car market is in sharp decline, extended by an 8.6 percent drop in January.Despite weak demand at home, Volkswagen increased its share of European sales. Its registrations fell 5.5 percent, a more modest decline than the market’s, as the premium Audi nameplate fell just 2.1 percent.Its two German luxury rivals proved even more resilient, with BMW brand sales rising 9.4 percent and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz gaining 4.7 percent.Sales by Renault’s low-cost Dacia brand rose 8.5 percent, limiting the group’s overall decline to 6.1 percent.The troubled Renault brand saw domestic orders rebound 12 percent last month, according to a dealership survey by La Lettre VN.Overall French orders fell 3.5 percent, the trade publication said, in a sign that registrations may stabilise in the coming months after a 15 percent January slide.South Korea’s Kia also fared well, with registrations surging 7.7 percent, while affiliate Hyundai’s sales fell just 2.2 percent.Italy’s Fiat posted a 12.4 percent sales decline, despite a more modest 4 percent drop for the Italian carmaker’s namesake brand.The upscale Alfa Romeo marque, upon which Fiat chief Sergio Marchionne is pinning the group’s recovery strategy, saw its European sales collapse 37 percent.	1.364655425
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Alfa ALFAA.MX said on Friday it plans to spin off the entirety of its remaining 75% stake in auto parts business Nemak NEMAKA.MX, sending Alfa's shares surging 17% on the prospect that the conglomerate could shrug off the struggling unit.If shareholders approve the proposal at an Aug. 17 meeting, they would receive one share of Controladora Nemak for each of their Alfa shares and retain share ownership in Alfa’s equity.“We plan a gradual and orderly transition process to make Nemak an independent business,�� Alfa President Alvaro Fernandez Garza said in a statement.Controladora Nemak would be listed on Mexico’s stock exchange following the spinoff, Alfa said. Nemak, which began to trade publicly in 2015, would stay listed separately.Nemak shareholders in the future would be able to decide whether to merge with Controladora Nemak, Alfa said.A 75% share of Nemak’s market cap is currently equivalent to 12.15 billion pesos ($547 million), according to Refinitiv data.Nemak, which makes aluminum parts for automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Toyota, saw second-quarter results battered by shutdowns of light-vehicle production due to the coronavirus crisis.It posted a $125 million loss, and revenue shrank 60% from 2019, making it the worst-performing of Alfa’s public companies.Analysts said investors would likely cheer Alfa cutting ties with Nemak, which could suffer further from the economic blows of the coronavirus pandemic.“Nemak is a business that... weighed negatively on Alfa’s results,�� Intercam said in a report. “This transaction should be highly positive for Alfa.”Alfa also owns 82% of petrochemicals company Alpek ALPEKA.MX and 53% of telecommunications provider Axtel AXTELCPO.MX. It is the full owner of food business Sigma, and oil and gas unit Newpek. The company plans to sell the majority of Newpek’s U.S. assets this year.	9.500578799
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp have agreed to cooperate in selling electric vehicles in India from around 2020, they said on Friday, aiming to give each other a leg up in emerging markets and low-emission technology.The announcement comes after the Japanese companies agreed in February to trade expertise in parts supplies and research and development.The partnership could help Toyota to expand in India’s massive car market, where drivers prefer the type of affordable compact vehicles in which Suzuki excels.Suzuki, in turn, is expected to gain from Toyota’s innovations in automated driving, artificial intelligence and low-emission vehicles.The companies said Suzuki will produce the electric vehicles and supply some to Toyota, which will provide technical support.	2.437846971
Jan 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will change the way it pays factory workers, focusing on their performance rather than their seniority, the Nikkei reported on Monday.Toyota's new arrangement, designed to attract young talent, will apply to about 40,000 employees, or about 60 percent of its workers, aged between 18 and 65, according to the Nikkei. (s.nikkei.com/1EMRveN)The automaker has unveiled the proposal to its labor union and is hopeful of rolling it out next January, the Nikkei said.Employees will be evaluated twice a year, with wages adjusted every six months, the Nikkei reported.Besides revamping its seniority-based system, the new arrangement will also reshuffle allowances for dependents to provide greater benefits to workers who are raising children, the financial daily reported.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber said it “will likely�� have to strike a licensing deal with Waymo or opt for costly changes to its autonomous driving software, after an expert found the ride-hailing giant still used technology from the Alphabet Inc unit.While it was unclear by when the company needed to decide on its next move in the blockbuster trade secrets dispute, Uber, in a quarterly securities filing on Tuesday, said that a detour in its software development “could limit or delay our production of autonomous vehicle technologies.”Uber has been racing to catch up to Waymo in the development of software and hardware to install in cars and trucks to allow for driverless taxi and delivery services.The expert review of Uber’s software was part of a legal settlement reached in February 2018 that brought to an abrupt halt a federal jury trial over whether the company unfairly benefited from confidential ideas allegedly secured by making former Waymo engineers key members of its self-driving car team.Waymo began as a project within sister company Google a decade ago, while Uber launched its effort four years ago.Uber declined to give details beyond its filing.Waymo told Reuters in a statement that the independent software expert’s findings “further confirm Waymo’s allegations that Uber misappropriated our software intellectual property. We will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our confidential information is not being used by Uber.”Last year, Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi had expressed confidence that the company had not used Waymo’s proprietary information in its hardware or software.But by this April, weeks ahead of its initial public offering, Uber disclosed that the expert software reviewer’s interim findings were mixed and could be costly.Waymo had alleged in court filings in 2017 that Uber was “misappropriating two, highly valuable Waymo trade secrets related to planner software,�� which processes data from sensors on the vehicle and controls its movement.Uber shares have tumbled about 40% since their market debut in May amid big quarterly losses as it spends heavily on marketing.Its self-driving venture has also faced other challenges.The United States National Transportation Safety Board in a recent report there were software flaws in an Uber self-driving test vehicle that struck and killed an Arizona woman in the middle of a road last year.Still, the Uber unit drew a $1 billion investment in April from SoftBank Group Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and automotive company Denso Corp.Last year’s settlement also gave Waymo a 0.34% stake in Uber, worth about $245 million based on Uber’s $72 billion valuation at the time.It is unclear if Waymo still holds those shares.Waymo this year began a limited robo-taxi service in Arizona.	-1.731421844

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Privately held power generator Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) started construction on the $845 million Woodbridge natural gas-fired power plant in New Jersey on Wednesday.The 700-megawatt plant, which will generate enough electricity to power about 700,000 homes, is owned by CPV, U.S. private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners, and Japanese trading firm Toyota Tsusho Corp.CPV said in a release the project is expected to enter service as soon as the first quarter of 2016 and will be operated by an affiliate of ArcLight. CPV is managing the construction process.The project is expected to create nearly 500 construction jobs and two dozen permanent jobs once it starts operating.The plant had been expected to sell capacity through a 15-year contract, called a Standard Offer Capacity Agreement (SOCA), with New Jersey utilities. However a federal court in New Jersey overturned the state law creating the capacity payments earlier in October.Officials at CPV had no comment on the federal court decision earlier this month.The plant will feature two of General Electric Co’s 216-MW gas turbines and one steam turbine. GE has said it will manufacture the gas turbines in Greenville, South Carolina, and the steam turbine in Schenectady, New York.	-2.401118968
* Toyota, Honda expected to report numbers later in day* Nissan sells 88,249 vehicles in China in September (Adds detail)BEIJING, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co’s China auto sales, excluding imports, fell 34.6 percent in September from a year earlier as Chinese consumers shunned Japanese cars in response to a territorial row between the two countries.Nissan’s vehicle venture with China’s Dongfeng Motor Group Co sold 88,249 vehicles last month, the Chinese company said.Sales totalled 1.09 million vehicles in the first nine months of this year, down 0.4 percent from the same period in 2011.Other Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor are expected to release their monthly China sales data later on Tuesday.Showroom traffic and sales have plunged at Japanese car firms in China since violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out in mid-September over the Japanese government’s purchase of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea from their private owner.A senior Toyota executive told Reuters last week its China sales fell about 40 percent year-on-year in September, to about 50,000 cars.China sales of smaller rival Mazda Motor Corp tumbled 35 percent in September from a year earlier.The dramatic drop in demand for Japanese vehicles has been an unexpected boon for some other foreign brands, with China sales for South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co rising 15 percent to 84,188 vehicles last month.

(Corrects full names of Ford and Toyota in seventh paragraph, fixes typo in penultimate paragraph and drops extraneous word in final paragraph)SHANGHAI/BEIJING, Dec 3 (Reuters) - China’s auto lobby has fiercely opposed a possible move by Beijing to ease restrictions on foreign ownership in the car industry, saying that the move would seriously weaken the position of indigenous carmakers.Dong Yang, secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), said that if foreign ownership rules were relaxed, Chinese carmakers would lose control of joint ventures they now own and run jointly with global automakers.“Foreign ownership being capped at 50 percent is the red line we must not cross because we need to protect our Chinese brands,�� Dong said in a statement posted on the CAAM website. The statement was dated Monday.“From another perspective, current restrictions have not dampened global carmakers�� enthusiasm whatsoever to invest in China, so why should we be more open?”CAAM’s opposition comes in the wake of indications by several Chinese policymakers that they are considering relaxing foreign investment rules in China’s automobile industry.CAAM is one of China’s biggest industry associations representing the automotive industry. Its nearly 2,000 members include China’s massive state-owned automakers such as SAIC Motor, FAW Group and Dongfeng Motor Group.China has required global automakers including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp to form joint ventures in order to produce cars in the country, hoping that Chinese carmakers can absorb foreign technology and management expertise to become more competitive.The Ministry of Commerce told a media briefing in Beijing last month that the government would likely relax foreign investment restrictions soon in areas including auto manufacturing.In addition to the 50-percent ownership cap, the current policy calls for foreign automakers to set up a jointly-run technical centre in China and to transfer certain technology to their local partners.At an automotive conference in Wuhan in October, Chen Lin, the Commerce Ministry official who oversees international automotive investment policy, acknowledged that unlike China, automakers investing in most countries around the world are not required to form a joint venture with a local partner to own and operate any assembly plants in their markets.“We do see this imbalance of policy,�� Chen told a panel discussion at the auto forum, urging Chinese automakers to study the impact from a possible lifting or easing of the joint venture rule. “It would be a life issue�� for them, Chen said.In his statement, CAAM’s Dong urged Chinese policymakers to think twice before making such life-and-death decisions, calling on the government to protect local brands.“The government shouldn’t rush to make decisions that would have a huge impact on the (auto) industry,�� and needs to study the issue and solicit opinions from various parties as much as possible.Foreign name plates dominate Chinese roads, with home-grown brands capturing only a 30 percent share of the market collectively.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean automakers saw their shares rise on Monday on optimism they would be exempt from import tariffs on vehicles the United States deems a threat to national security, after the U.S. president said a revised trade deal could address concerns.Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp shares were both up nearly 3% in morning trade.U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared some imported vehicles and vehicle parts posed a national security threat. But he delayed a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose import tariffs to allow for more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan.He also said a U.S.-South Korea bilateral trade deal, revised last year and in which Seoul made auto sector concessions, “could help to address the threatened impairment of national security��.“We hope that Korea would not make the list of countries subject to tariffs, but it is premature to make a prediction,�� South Korea’s finance minister, Hong Nam-ki, told reporters after a government meeting on Monday.“The government will not lay back and will continue all-out efforts to persuade the United States not to put Korea on the list,�� Hong said.Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp, which said in March it would invest $13 billion in U.S. operations through 2021, called the U.S. declaration “a major set-back for American consumers, workers and the auto industry�� and said it sent the message “our investments are not welcomed��.Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd shares were traded nearly flat on Monday. Nissan Motor Co Ltd saw its shares fall 1.6%.Nissan exports roughly 31% of Japan-made cars to the United States compared with 22% at Toyota, Moody’s estimated last year. Honda has the lowest ratio among the three, Moody’s said.	6.011345356
(James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)(Reuters) - Toyota’s sparkling earnings show how Abenomics may be good for Japanese companies now, but perhaps a bust for investing in Japan over the long term.Toyota, the world’s biggest car maker, reported a 70 percent jump in profits last quarter, as it got a boost from this year’s 12 percent drop in the yen against the dollar.A look under the hood, however, shows that Toyota’s gains may not translate into the sustained expansion Japan hopes Abenomics will spark. Named after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Abenomics is an attempt to use government spending, radical monetary policy and competitive reform to finally rescue Japan from a 20-year-plus slump.The first step was to hammer the yen lower, making Japanese exporters more globally competitive. A weaker yen has helped Toyota, but not perhaps in the way policymakers want.Two things have to happen for Abenomics to succeed. First, external demand prompted by a weaker yen needs to drive a self-sustaining consumer expansion. That requires wage gains.Second, companies need to invest and expand, using a new pricing advantage from the yen to build volume, not simply to make more money on every car sold.On the evidence thus far, neither of the two needed things is happening or is likely to happen.Consider Toyota. While profits are up 70 percent, most of the focus is on increasing margins, with capital expenditure forecast to rise just 2 percent and research and development forecast to stay the same.That’s hardly the massive expansion Japan needs.And while Toyota, and others, have indicated a willingness to boost wages in the future if profits continue to roll in, thus far they’ve been far more likely to hand out bonuses rather than make permanent increases in their fixed costs.It looks very much, in other words, as if Toyota, and likely many other companies, are happy to increase profit margins but not take on the risks of paying more and expanding rapidly. Given the history of the auto industry and Japan itself, it is hard to blame them.Japanese workers, having lived through the past 20 years, are understandably wary about increasing spending permanently based on a one-off bonus.And while Abe said in October that higher wages were “vital�� and has used various forums to pressure companies, even corporate tax cuts haven’t had much of an effect. A recent Reuters corporate survey found that only 5 percent of respondents would use additional savings to raise wages.This leaves Japanese workers in a difficult bind. Prices are rising at last, at least a bit, but wages not so much.Core consumer prices, which include oil products but not fresh food, rose 0.7 percent in the year to September. Even so-called ‘core-core�� prices, which excludes both food and energy, were flat, the first time since 2008 that they have not fallen.While that might seem like cause for rejoicing, wages have been stagnant. Salaries are in their longest slide since 2010, with regular wages excluding overtime and bonuses down 0.3 percent in September. Total cash earnings rose 0.1 percent.Minutes of the Bank of Japan’s October meeting, recently released, showed some disquiet over the pace of wage gains, with one member noting that sustained gains might not appear before the annual wage negotiation round next April. Except then a consumption tax will increase by 3 percentage points, almost certainly more than swamping any wage increases.The fear, of course, is that consumers won’t consume, and when next April’s consumption tax comes along, Japan will drift back into deflation and recession. And remember, Japan, as a country with very large debts and a demographic downward path, needs inflation. Only inflation, and genuine growth, will allow it to manage its debts over the longer term.Here again we have a great example of how extraordinary monetary policy creates risks for everyone while handing out what may be short-term benefits disproportionately to the wealthy. The Nikkei 225 stock index is up by a third this year, and by 50 percent over the past year. Profits among exporters are, by and large, growing quite well.Even those gains may prove to be short-lived, and taking a five-year view, investors would be wise to be very cautious about the future of Abenomics and Japanese assets.	-2.771601017

FREMONT, Calif, June 22 (Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, an entrepreneur known for his outsized ambition, on Friday made a stunning forecast: battery-powered cars will likely match the internal combustion engine in popularity by the middle of the next decade.“In 20 years more than half of new cars manufactured will be fully electric,�� Musk said. “I feel actually quite safe in that bet. That’s a bet I will put money on.”Musk, who divides his time between Tesla and his space exploration startup SpaceX, said it might even happen sooner than that.“It’s probably going to be in the 12- to 15-year time frame,�� he said, speaking at an event at Tesla’s manufacturing plant in Fremont, where he handed over the keys to the first buyers of the new Model S sedan.Electric vehicles have struggled to find an audience beyond Hollywood celebrities, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and policymakers in Washington, primarily due to their premium pricing and anxieties about their driving range.Most analysts see pure electric cars accounting for only a single-digit percentage of total sales over the next decade, in part because of the cost of batteries and the uncertainty around continued government subsidies for the new technology.Rival automaker Nissan Motor Co, the most bullish mass-market car maker, forecasts that by 2020 10 percent of all cars sold will be electric. In an interview with Reuters on Friday in Tokyo, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said he believed that forecast was attainable if enough automakers followed Nissan into offering EVs.Musk, the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark character in “Iron Man,�� has overcome odds and a turbulent time at the carmaker, marked by a near-debilitating financial crisis, to now deliver the second car in its portfolio. The company also sells the Roadster sports car.In addition to Tesla, Musk founded SpaceX, which last month sent the first privately developed ship into space to dock with the International Space Station, and online payments site PayPal, now part of eBay.Despite the slow adoption of electric vehicles, many automakers are planning to launch them to meet rising fuel efficiency standards.Apart from General Motors�� Volt and Nissan’s all-electric Leaf, Toyota has begun selling a plug-in Prius, and EVs from Ford, Honda, BMW and Fiat will join the fray this year, along with cars from start-up Coda Automotive.Tesla, which has said it has adopted a slow, methodical approach to the launch, expects to deliver 5,000 Model S sedans by the end of 2012. Reservations for the sedan have topped 10,000.The company expects to deliver over 20,000 vehicles next year, Musk said.The owner of the first Model S to roll off the assembly is Steve Jurvetson, managing director of venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, an early investor in Tesla. Musk gets the second Model S.Tim Draper, founder and managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, received his keys on Friday after having waited nearly three years for the car.“It’s the smoothest car I have ever driven,�� Draper said, who also likes its large touch navigation screen.The Model S is the electric carmaker’s most crucial launch yet as it represents the company’s transition to the mass market.Tesla has described 2012 as a “year with two halves�� with the Model S launch as the dividing line. Ninety percent of the company’s revenue this year is expected to come from the sedan.Tesla also draws revenue from its partnerships with Toyota Motor Co’s and Daimler AG. In February, Tesla announced an expanded deal with Daimler to create an electric powertrain for a new Mercedes Benz EV.Musk said that while he was positive about Tesla’s powertrain business, he added ��10 CEOs determine whether we have a powertrain business or not.”Tesla was talking to a major carmaker about a “high volume�� powertrain deal, Musk said, but did not give any details.Tesla also makes the powertrain system for the electric Toyota RAV4. Toyota, which unveiled the model last month, said it projects to sell 2,600 of the sport-utility vehicle over the next three years in the United States.The Model S base model will be priced at about $57,000, before a $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit, for a car that can travel 160 miles (258 kilometers) on a full charge.More popular will be the Model S version that will be able to travel 230 miles (370 km) on a full charge. That version will cost $10,000 more. A version of the Model S that will have a range of 300 miles (483 km) will cost another $10,000.	-2.44447365

(Adds Volkswagen comment)Oct 23 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers filed on Friday for an election by 165 skilled trades workers at the Volkswagen AG auto plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the labor union said.The filing for the election was made with the National Labor Relations Board. Federal law allows a portion of a work location to be represented by a union, the UAW said.No date has been set for another election, a UAW spokesman said. The union lost an election to represent all 1,500 hourly production workers at the plant in February 2014.A Volkswagen spokesman acknowledged the filing and said the company was pleased with its current involvement with the union as well as the workers affiliated with the anti-UAW American Council of Employees.Gary Casteel, UAW secretary-treasurer and head of the union’s effort to organize non-union auto plants, said VW’s current form of recognition that allows union access to management on plant issues was short of the right that the union desires to collectively bargain for workers.“Volkswagen’s policy in Chattanooga was a gesture and our local union has engaged accordingly,�� said Casteel. “At the end of the day, the policy cannot be a substitute for meaningful employee representation and co-determination with management.”The Chattanooga plant is viewed by the UAW as its best chance to organize a foreign-owned plant in the southern United States. German, Japanese and South Korean companies have plants in the region where most states are so-called “right-to-work,�� where union membership cannot be a requirement of employment.Volkswagen, which has a history of worker recognition through German-styled works councils that include blue- and white-collar employees at its plants around the world, has been the least hostile foreign automaker to the union.The UAW is in talks for a new four-year contract with General Motors Co after the union’s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV membership ratified a new deal for 40,000 U.S. union workers.Labor analysts have said that pay and benefits for union workers at the Detroit Three automakers influence labor costs for non-union southern U.S. plants of Volkswagen, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors.Regarding pay, labor analyst Arthur Schwartz said the non-union plants, “don’t want to get too far out of whack because that would invite the UAW in. Georgetown in Kentucky (where Toyota has a large plant) has basically tried to keep pace and so far it’s worked.�� (Reporting by Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Leslie Adler, Toni Reinhold)	-1.76334477

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Monday said it was committed to the ailing U.S. sedan market and that it expected a new model of its Camry, the top-selling passenger car in the United States for decades, to help boost the company's sales in the segment.The automaker said it was “inconceivable�� that mid-size sedans would disappear from the market, and that any move by its rivals to stop selling what was once among the most popular vehicles would allow Toyota to boost its presence.Cheap U.S. gasoline prices have prompted drivers to opt for larger SUVs and pick-up trucks. Automakers have been scrambling to meet this growing demand and, as a result, sedans have been losing their share of the U.S. market for new car sales - at 38 percent now versus around 44 percent in 2015.“If other automakers left the sedan market to focus more on SUVs, that would be an opportunity to expand our market share of the segment,�� Camry’s chief engineer, Masato Katsumata, said at the launch of the latest Camry model in Japan.Sedans and smaller models are a key U.S. sales segment for Toyota. In the first half of 2017, they accounted for about 43.5 percent of Toyota’s total sales, versus 48.6 percent a year ago.Toyota is targeting monthly U.S. sales of 30,000 Camrys after the new model goes on sale in August.In June, it sold 29,463 units of the current Camry model in the United States, down 9.5 percent from a year ago.“Sedans are not a growth segment these days, but we want the new Camry to rehabilitate the segment,�� said Moritaka Yoshida, president of Toyota’s in-house mid-size vehicle company.	3.853617965
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese steelmakers may need to accelerate restructuring plans or close more facilities as construction project delays due to the coronavirus add to industry woes, according to an analyst and industry officials.Japan’s top two steelmakers Nippon Steel and JFE Steel, owned by JFE Holdings, have already announced plans to temporarily suspend five blast furnaces in total, cutting about 25% of their capacity.The move could push annual crude steel output by the world’s No.3 steel producer to below 90 million tonnes, which would be the lowest since the global financial crisis in 2009.Japan’s tally of infections stood at 11,500 by Wednesday, with the government coming under growing pressure over what many see as a desire to avoid a shutdown of the economy.“If the pandemic continues for long, steelmakers may need to bring forward some restructuring plans or shut more facilities,�� said Atsushi Yamaguchi, senior analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.(GRAPHIC: Japan steelmakers undeperform broader market as lockdowns shutter construction &amp; manutfacturing activity - )Major construction companies such as Shimizu and Kajima have decided to suspend hundreds of their projects until May 6, a deadline for Japan’s state of emergency declared on April 7.Japan expanded a state of emergency last week to include the entire country, from the main seven population centres, including Tokyo.“About 90% of 500 projects in the seven prefectures have been halted to avoid the infection among workers,�� a Shimizu spokesman said, adding the suspension areas have been expanded.Kajima and construction company Obayashi are in talks with their clients to put a halt to their 700 and 600 projects respectively until May 6.“We may need to slash our output from May if steel demand falls further due to wider suspension of construction projects,�� Tokyo Steel Manufacturing’s managing director, Kiyoshi Imamura, said.Steel demand had already been hit as automakers, including Toyota Motor, temporarily shut down some local plants due to weaker demand or parts shortages.Export demand is also declining due to slower industry activities worldwide, said Yamaguchi.Japan’s industry ministry has predicted steel demand for automobiles to fall 8% in April-June from a year earlier, while export will drop 21%.(GRAPHIC: Global steelmaker share price performance in 2020 - )Even before the virus crisis, steelmakers had been suffering weaker demand amid the U.S.-Sino trade war and higher prices of raw materials such as iron ore due to strong appetite from China, forcing Nippon Steel and JFE to cut their facilities permanently by 10-13%.Shares in Nippon Steel and JFE have lost more than 50% so far this year to hit record lows, underperforming a 19% loss in broader TOPIX index.	1.99704142

TOKYO (Reuters) - This weekend marks the 50th anniversary of the Toyota Corolla, one of the world’s best-selling cars.Since the first model went on sale in Japan on Nov. 5, 1966, some 44.3 million Corollas have been sold globally through the end of September, including the Corolla Fielder station wagon and other variants, the Japanese automaker says.Here are some milestones along the way and where it stands today.In the late 1950s, as Japan’s economy recovered from World War Two, automakers aimed to produce an affordable car for the average family, most of whom didn’t have a vehicle.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T first came out with the Publica, which wasn't very well received. In 1966, it introduced the sportier two-door Corolla with a jaw-dropping plan: to build 30,000 of them a month at a time when Toyota's total monthly production was 50,000 vehicles.The car sold well as Japanese consumers aspired to get the ��3 C’s�� �� color TVs, cars and coolers (air conditioners). Three years after the launch, the Corolla became the country’s top-selling car and helped usher in an age of motorization in Japan.“BETTER THAN AVERAGE”The man in charge of developing the original Corolla, Tatsuo Hasegawa, had designed aircraft during the war, and incorporated some aircraft aerodynamics into the new car.His concept for the Corolla was ��80-plus-points�� - in short, a car with a more-than-passing grade on several counts that gave customers the feel of a better-than-average product.For the first-generation Corolla, the going-the-extra-mile “add-on�� was its sportiness, despite being a family car. Hasegawa gave the car a 4-speed manual transmission operated by a gearshift on the floor, instead of the more typical 3-speed, column shifter at the time.The Corolla also had a 1,100cc engine, a bit larger than that of its rival, the Nissan Sunny.Toyota has stuck to its tradition of introducing new technologies to the masses with each remodeling of the Corolla. Now in its 11th generation in Japan, the car is made in 13 countries around the world and sold in more than 150 countries.After 33 straight years as Japan’s top-selling model, the Corolla lost the crown in Japan to rival Honda Motor’s Fit hatchback in 2002.It is now also outsold by the Toyota Aqua and Prius hybrid-only models as domestic customers opt for more fuel-efficient cars.The outlook at home is bleak, with the overall car market due to shrink further along with the population. Domestic sales of the Corolla are now about a quarter of their peak of around 400,000 in 1973. But the Corolla is still a cash cow in the United States, where it is the No.2 best-selling passenger car model so far this year, behind only the Toyota Camry.	4.516358464
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T officials said the Japanese automaker and its two local joint-venture partners are on track to sell 900,000 vehicles in China this year, despite a 3.5-percent year-on-year fall in its China sales last month.A senior executive and a midlevel official, speaking separately with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that a dominant view inside Toyota’s sales unit in China is that the company should be able to meet the sales objective for the year, as sales momentum should pick up in the second half of the year.Toyota, which operates joint ventures in China with FAW Group 000800.SZ and Guangzhou Automobile Group 601238.SS, is aiming to sell 900,000 vehicles in China this year, up 7.1 percent from 2012.Toyota said on Thursday it and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 75,600 automobiles in China in July, down 3.5 percent from a year earlier.That followed a 9 percent year-on-year increase in June and a 0.3 percent rise in May.In the first seven months of this year, through the end of July, Toyota sold about 492,500 vehicles, down 5.4 percent from a year earlier.The data reaffirm a slow but steady comeback by Toyota from the sales crisis that has battered its sales in the wake of a row between Beijing and Tokyo over disputed islands in the East China Sea.	-1.536755387
(Repeats to widen distribution)TORONTO, April 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales inched just 0.2 percent higher in March from a year earlier, figures on Tuesday showed, but an independent auto industry analyst said the modest increase masked a solid performance during severe winter weather, especially in comparison with the record sales of March 2013.Canadian sales rose to 157,060 vehicles in March from 156,680 the year before, marking the second-best March on record, said Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.“Being up by a sliver isn’t shooting the lights out, but when put in the context of a never-ending winter and strong year-ago sales, then current sales levels should be applauded rather than scorned,�� he wrote in a report.Truck sales climbed 5.1 percent to 90,851 vehicles from 86,475 last year, while car sales went in the opposite direction, falling 5.7 percent to 66,209 vehicles, the DesRosiers report said.“Perhaps the biggest ongoing dynamic is the strength in the light truck market,�� he wrote. That trend is also evident in year-to-date figures, with truck sales up 6.3 percent and auto sales down 6.2 percent.Demand for Detroit 3 branded vehicles slipped 1.1 percent in March to 68,661 vehicles, the report said, while sales of other makers were 1.3 percent higher at 88,399 vehicles.Chrysler Canada, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , took the top sales spot, as strong demand for its trucks offset a slump in car sales.Car sales tumbled by 33.5 percent to 3,469 from 5,217, the company said. Truck sales climbed by 11.7 percent to 21,180 from 18,956. Chrysler Canada’s total sales for the month rose 2 percent to 24,649 from 24,173 in the same period last year.Year to date, Chrysler’s total sales were up 4.9 percent at 60,869 vehicles, with truck sales 10.8 percent higher and car sales down 21.4 percent. The company said the results marked its best first quarter and March sales since 2000.Total March sales at Ford Motor Co of Canada fell 10.7 percent to 22,390 vehicles from 25,082, DesRosiers�� data showed. Ford had not yet issued its own figures late on Tuesday afternoon.General Motors Canada, which was also expected to release its data on Tuesday afternoon, had a 7.8 percent jump in sales, DesRosiers�� report said. Total sales increased to 21,790 vehicles, from 20,218 in the same period last year.Toyota Canada Inc said its March sales rose 6.8 percent to 17,397 cars and trucks, lifting first quarter sales 6.2 percent above the same period last year.The results included March records for the 2014 Toyota Highlander and Toyota Tundra, the company said.Sales of Toyota-branded vehicles rose 5.9 percent in March, to 15,509, while Lexus brand sales soared 30.5 percent to a record 1,594. The company said it sold 294 Scion vehicles.Workers at Toyota Canada are expected to vote next week on whether to join Canada’s largest private-sector union, Unifor. The results will not be known until later in April.Honda Canada Inc reported a 6 percent rise in March sales to 15,292 vehicles. Sales of Honda brands rose 5.4 percent to 13,454 and Acura brand sales climbed 6.4 percent to 1,838.Year-to-date sales in the Honda division were up 8.7 percent to 28,099 vehicles, the company said, while sales in the Acura unit were 0.9 percent higher at 3,721 vehicles.In the United States, auto sales inched up more than expected in March after two months in which weather reduced demand, and at least two auto industry executives said a more robust sales rebound could come in April.Ford reported a 3 percent rise in U.S. sales; Toyota a 5 percent gain, and Chrysler Group, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier.

The plant currently has capacity to manufacture 340,000 cars a year for all three brands: Toyota, Peugeot and Citroen, according to Toyota.Toyota markets a derivative of the jointly developed car as the Aygo, Peugeot as the 108, and Citroen as the C1. Toyota sold about 71,000 Aygo cars in 2014.“Nowadays, of course, business conditions are so tough that getting together to share investments and share manufacturing capacity to make sure that you can make business plans that fly makes sense for everyone,�� Taraves told reporters.“We are very pragmatic, and we’re very open.�� (Editing by Ryan Woo)	-2.485659656

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it planned to recall around 1.03 million vehicles, including its gasoline-hybrid Prius model, in Japan, North America, Europe and other regions due to an issue with the engine wire harness which can pose a fire risk.Following a domestic recall announcement by Japan’s transport ministry, Toyota said that in affected vehicles, the wire harness which connects to the hybrid power control unit can come into contact with the covering at the connection point.If dust accumulates on the wire harness or the cover, the insulation on the wires could wear down over time due to vehicle vibrations. This could cause an electrical short circuit, which could generate heat and lead to a risk of fire, Toyota said.The issue affects vehicles produced in Japan between June 2015 and May 2018, and includes the plug-in version of the Prius and the C-HR compact crossover SUV sold in Japan, Europe, Australia and other countries.Roughly half of the recalls would take place in Japan, Toyota spokesman Jean-Yves Jault said.Only the Prius model would be recalled in the United States, where around 192,000 vehicles were affected. he said.Jault added that the issue had led to one incident of a short circuiting in Japan which produced smoke from the vehicle.	1.272984441

* Toyota falls after Trump threatens on Mexico manufacturing plans* Fast Retailing contributes hefty negative 91 points to Nikkei* Nikkei up 1.8 percent so far for weekTOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average dropped on Friday morning as automakers dragged after incoming U.S President Donald Trump threatened to slap punitive taxes on Toyota cars imported into the United States from Mexico.Index heavyweight Fast Retailing also dragged on the market after reporting weak monthly sales.The Nikkei fell 0.4 percent to 19,439.24 in midmorning trade, after hitting as low as 19,354.44 earlier, although the benchmark index is up 1.8 percent for the week so far.Fast Retailing Co dived 5.6 percent and contributed a hefty negative 91 points to the benchmark index after saying that same-store sales at its Uniqlo clothing outlets in Japan fell 5 percent in December from a year earlier.Toyota Motor Corp fell more than 3 percent at one point after Trump threatened to impose heavy taxes on the automaker if it builds its Corolla cars in Mexico for the U.S. market.Other Japanese carmakers also fell, with both Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co falling more than 2 percent.Analysts said that investors are focused on U.S. jobs data due out later in the day, and overall trading will likely be subdued before a long weekend in Japan.Markets in Japan will be closed on Monday for a national holiday.“In the near-term, investors are looking at the volatile dollar-yen moves,�� said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.That said, the current dollar-yen levels are still favourable for Jan-March earnings for Japanese exporters, which had expected a much stronger yen, Kuramochi added.“The Nikkei is likely to gain further in the next few weeks on hopes that companies�� earnings will be stronger than expected,�� he said.At 0147 GMT, the dollar rose 0.6 percent at 116.02 yen after falling 1.6 percent overnight.The broader Topix dropped 0.4 percent to 1,549.92 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 fell 0.4 percent to 13,899.25.	-5.677183052

"PLYMOUTH, Michigan (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is taking the unusual step of offering a mildly restyled version of the Chevrolet Malibu in an effort to reverse the last 18 months of disappointing sales since the mid-sized sedan's last major redesign in early 2012.The 2014 Malibu, hitting dealer showrooms now, was reworked to improve fuel efficiency and interior space, update the styling and add more technology and a new base 2.5-liter engine.Analysts say the move is intended to halt GM’s slide in the U.S. auto market’s largest and most hotly contested sector.The 2014 model also will be backed by a marketing campaign on par with last year’s launch, another unusual move for the No. 1 U.S. automaker.“They stumbled and they created some of their own problems in 2012 with the Malibu launch, and then when the car came out it was not best-in-class,�� auto analyst Maryann Keller said.“They realized they couldn’t keep that car as it was on the market in a very, very competitive segment,�� she added.The redesigned 2013 Malibu was introduced in limited numbers and in a hybrid version in February 2012. More varieties and different engine options did not arrive in greater quantities until later in the year.Automakers typically wait at least two years before refreshing a car design.“We recognize the importance of this segment and how we needed to make sure we were as competitive as possible,�� Chris Perry, vice president of Chevy marketing in North America, told reporters at an event here. “Eighteen months into it, we recognized that we needed to up our game.”Perry said the refreshed Malibu design was required by the competitiveness of the market, and GM would do it again in other segments if required. He said it would be wrong to call the launch of the 2013 Malibu a failure.Mid-sized cars make up about 15 percent of the overall U.S. market and the Malibu ranks fifth in sales with 8.2 percent of the market so far this year, according to research firm Kelley Blue Book.Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Camry led the segment with a 16.8 percent share, followed by Honda Motor Co's 7267.T Accord at 14.9 percent, Nissan Motor Co's 7201.T Altima at 13.2 percent, and Ford Motor Co's F.N Fusion at 12 percent, according to KBB.Malibu’s U.S. sales last year rose 3 percent to almost 211,000 vehicles, but so far this year sales are down about 13 percent.Total industry midsize sales are up 1.5 percent this year, according to KBB. While Toyota’s gain in that period matches the segment’s, Fusion (up 17 percent), Accord (up 14 percent) and Altima (up 7 percent) have all shown strong gains, according to research firm Autodata.Fusion, Accord and Altima also were redesigned last year.Perry said GM is spending about as much as it did to launch the redesigned 2013 model last year, although he declined to quantify that total.“We’re looking at this as an all-new launch,�� he said.GM spent $226 million advertising the Malibu in the United States last year, according to WPP Plc WPP.L unit Kantar Media, which tracks such spending.The automaker boosted the 2014 Malibu’s fuel efficiency by 3 miles per gallon to 25 in the city and by 2 mpg to 36 on the highway with the new base engine. GM said that tops the performance of Ford’s Fusion and Toyota’s Camry.The 2014 Malibu, which starts at almost $23,000, in place of last year’s hybrid eAssist engine now features stop-start engine technology that saves fuel by allowing the car’s engine to shut off when the vehicle is at rest and restart when the accelerator is pressed.The car also enables incoming texts on the driver’s smartphones to be converted to speech and read over the car’s audio system, a first for the segment according to GM.The automaker also added on the 2014 Malibu Apple's AAPL.O ""Siri"" personal assistant feature at the push of a button, something previously only offered on the Chevy Sonic and Spark cars.(IThe story has been filed again to correct last paragraph and state that Apple’s Siri was previously offered on the Chevy Sonic and Spark cars instead of the Cruze and Sonic.)"	-3.782757311
* Denso cuts full-year operating profit forecast by 10 pct* Forecast cut a sign of difficulties for Japan carmakers* Denso posts lower than expected op profit of 58.1 bln yenTOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts maker Denso Corp cut its forecast for full-year operating profit by 10 percent on Wednesday, citing a weaker outlook for car production in China, as well as in Japan and Europe.Japanese car makers reported tumbling sales in China in September, hit by a backlash against Japanese products after a territorial row between the two countries, and Honda Motor Co warned this week it could take months for business to return to normal.Denso, Japan’s top-ranked maker of car electronic and electrical parts, cut its full-year operating profit forecast to 225 billion yen ($2.8 billion) and reported a July-September result of 58.1 billion yen.The result missed an average 63.5 billion yen estimate by six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but was up up 60 percent from a year ago, when Japanese firms were reeling from effects of a huge earthquake in March 2011.Denso, owned 22.5 percent by Toyota Motor Corp, said sales had been solid in Japan and North America, but warned of a gloomy outlook.“Considering future business conditions, such as a decrease of car production in Japan, Europe and China, we made a downward revision of our year-end forecast,�� Chief Executive Nobuaki Katoh said in a statement.About half of the 25 billion yen cut in the full-year forecast could be attributed to lower output in China, which accounts for about 6 percent of Denso’s total revenue, Denso spokesmen said.Car production remained slow in Europe due to an economic slump, while in Japan, green car subsidies that helped boost sales ran out in September, the company said.Denso’s biggest market is Japan, which contributed nearly 70 percent of its operating profit for the six months to September.The Toyota group accounted for 52 percent of Denso’s 1.7 trillion yen revenue in April-September.Toyota, which will announce its second quarter earnings on Nov. 5, may trim its group production plan for 2012 by 2 percent from 10.05 million, media reports have said.Nissan Motor Co reports its results on Nov. 6.Shares in Denso were 2.3 percent firmer, while the overall market was up 1.5 percent.	11.11397961
Joey Logano reaffirmed his mastery of the road course at Watkins Glen International, but it took a three-wide restart late in Saturday’s Zippo 200 for the driver of the No. 22 Team Penske Ford to ultimately get the job done.After winning his fourth straight NASCAR Xfinity Series pole at the 2.45-mile track, Logano took teammate Brad Keselowski and Joe Gibbs Racing driver Ryan Preece three-wide into Turn 1 after a restart on lap 75 of 82.Logano’s move forced Keselowski wide and Logano cleared his teammate before the entry to Turn 2. But Keselowski wasn’t finished. He hounded Logano relentlessly until Keselowski spun in Turn 1 with two laps left.That gave Logano a comfortable margin, and he cruised to the finish line 3.362 seconds ahead of charging AJ Allmendinger, as Keselowski came across 10th. Allmendinger passed third-place finisher Justin Allgaier in the final corner to secure the runner-up spot.“That was all I had,�� said Logano, who came to the green for the final restart with tires six laps fresher than Keselowski’s. “He was definitely faster. I thought the tires would have been enough to be faster than him.“I had a good restart and got in front of him, and he dogged me. These Xfinity cars draft quite a bit down these straightaways, and it’s hard to pull away. It felt good to race each other really hard, so it’s cool to see Penske cars doing that.”The victory was Logano’s third in four races at WGI, his second in four starts this season and the 30th of his Xfinity career, breaking a tie with Matt Kenseth for seventh on the all-time list.Preece came home fourth, his fifth top 10 and fourth top five in six 2018 starts. Aric Almirola completed the top five.Logano won the race’s first stage before a rainstorm forced a change to rain tires. Allmendinger showed his road racing superiority by pulling away to win the second stage before the sun came out and dried the track.Allmendinger drew a one-lap penalty for sliding too far and pitting outside his stall during a fuel-only green-flag stop on Lap 52, but he fought back to finish second after two late cautions bunched the field.“Just a dumb mistake on my part,�� Allmendinger said. “I was coming in for fuel there, and it was still a little bit damp on pit road... I rolled in and slid a little more than I expected and got the nose over the line, and they’d already started to refuel.“I just knew that, once we got the yellow, I was going to have to start roughing people up and driving up through there as hard as I could.”Christopher Bell fell short in his attempt to match Sam Ard’s series record of four straight victories. Bell recovered from a pass-through penalty (for crewmen over the wall too soon on a Lap 16 stop) and finished ninth.But Bell holds the series lead by 22 points over Cole Custer, who finished sixth on Saturday. Daniel Hemric (16th) is third, 23 points back, and fourth-place Elliott Sadler trials by 26 points.NASCAR Xfinity Series Race - Zippo 200 at The GlenWatkins Glen InternationalWatkins Glen, New YorkSaturday, August 4, 20181.

* Total cuts in Iranian oil imports deepen in April* Buyers reluctant to renew contracts as sanctions tighten* April Iran oil imports to fall 18.5 pct from Jan-FebSINGAPORE/TOKYO, April 10 (Reuters) - Japanese trading houses are reducing Iranian crude imports from April, industry sources said on Tuesday, joining the country’s refiners in deepening cuts even after the United States said Japan had done enough to support sanctions against Iran.The U.S. and European Union have tightened measures aimed at reducing Iran’s oil trade, stemming the flow of petrodollars to Tehran and forcing the Islamic Republic to halt a nuclear program the West suspects is intended to produce weapons.Between them, Japan’s trading houses and refiners will reduce Iranian crude imports by about 60,000 barrels per day (bpd) in April, industry sources said. The reduction is the equivalent to about 18.5 percent of the 322,900 bpd that Japan imported in the first two months of the year, according to the latest government data available.Some of Japan’s trading companies, like some of its refiners, let annual import contracts with Iran lapse at the end of March, industry sources said. The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media.The cuts come even after the United States in March exempted Japan and 10 other EU nations from sanctions due to take effect in July because they have significantly cut purchases of Iranian oil. Soon after receiving the exemption, Finance Minister Jun Azumi said Japan would continue to cut imports of Iranian oil.Japan’s imports of 322,900 bpd in January and February were already down 28 percent on the first two months of 2011, according to data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.The U.S. has pointed to Japan as an example for other Iranian crude buyers as the country reduced purchases even though it needed more oil overall to help meet rising domestic demand after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in March 2011.World oil prices have surged this year on concern the sanctions will disrupt Iran’s supplies and tighten global markets. Benchmark Brent crude traded just below $122 a barrel on Tuesday, up over 13 percent to date this year.Japan should have little problem sourcing alternative oil supplies in April, typically the period of weakest demand globally after the Northern Hemisphere winter ends. But later in the year, as the markets get tighter, it may have to pay more to substitute for the Iranian barrels, said Victor Shum, senior partner at oil consultancy Purvin &amp; Gertz.“A reduction in Iranian crude sales may not have much of an impact on the market in the second quarter as demand usually ebbs after winter and many refineries undertake maintenance,�� Shum said. “But things would be different once summer starts and demand recovers.”Japan’s demand for crude to generate electricity will rise this summer as the country faces a complete shutdown of its nuclear power plants due to public safety concerns after last year’s nuclear disaster.Japan’s trading houses are reducing imports by at least 20,000 barrels per day from April, industry sources said.Mitsubishi Corp. has allowed a contract to import around 15,000 bpd to lapse, sources said. The deal was due for renewal from April, they added. Mitsubishi declined to comment on the volumes or status of its contract.Toyota Tsusho Corp. has failed to renew a contract for 5,000 bpd, sources said. Toyota Tsusho sold that crude into Showa Shell Sekiyo KK and JX Nippon Oil &amp; Energy Corp , industry sources said.Toyota Tsusho declined to comment.Japanese refiners and traders have been reducing imports from Iran for several years, due to concerns about security of supply from the Islamic Republic amid tensions over its nuclear programme.Most other trading houses that were buyers of Iranian crude stopped purchases in the previous fiscal year that began April 1, 2011, sources said.Itochu Corp. has imported no crude from Iran since before the financial year that started in April 2011, a company spokesman said.Itochu previously held a 5,000 bpd contract and sold the crude on to refiner Cosmo Oil Co..Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd. halted imports in January 2012 and no longer has a term contract, a spokeswoman said. Industry sources said Mitsui previously bought 10,000 bpd.Kanematsu Corp. stopped buying Iranian in 2010 or earlier, and a company spokeswoman said the company has no Iranian oil contract.Marubeni Corp. has a term contract for about 10,000 bpd that was up for renewal this month, but the company declined to comment on this deal.Those that plan to continue importing Iranian crude face difficulties finding shipping, insurance and banks to clear payments due to sanctions.Reflecting the difficulties in doing business with Tehran, Japanese refiners have secured a clause in annual contracts that exempts them from incurring a penalty if international sanctions prevent crude buyers from taking delivery of Iranian oil.The force majeure clause would exempt Japan’s refiners from liability if they were unable to import crude due to the increasingly stringent sanctions. The clause is usually limited to exempting buyers and sellers from liability due to fires, accidents and natural calamities.Even if transactions do not fall foul of sanctions, the reputational risk of having dealings with Tehran are working as a strong deterrent to trade.	-2.181553751

TOKYO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose on Friday, tracking tech-led strength on Wall Street overnight as hopes for more U.S. stimulus offset some concerns about the health of the global economy.The Nikkei 225 Index ended 0.51% higher at 23,204.62. The broader Topix gained 0.48% to 1,634.23.For the week, however, the benchmark fell 0.67%, as some analysts warned that worries about a second wave of coronavirus cases in Europe could limit further upside for Japanese shares.Supporting sentiment on the day, a top U.S. lawmaker said Democrats in the House of Representatives were working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week.As much as $380 billion from the U.S. Congress�� last big coronavirus aid package is unused and could help households and businesses if lawmakers approve, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Japan’s high-tech shares rose, tracking overnight gains in U.S. bellwethers such as Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Nvidia Corp and Facebook Inc.Investors also bought shares before the next round of corporate earnings to ensure they are eligible to receive dividends on their holdings, traders and analysts said.Among the top 30 core Topix names, electric parts maker Keyence and automaker Toyota Motor Co gained the most, up 2.16% and 1.73%, respectively.The biggest underperformers were East Japan Railway Co , down 3.56%, and Central Japan Railway Co, which shed 2.85%.There were 148 advancers on the Nikkei index against 69 decliners on Friday.The volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board was 1.28 billion, compared with the average of 1.14 billion in the past 30 days.

* Toyota considering Shanghai, Dalian -exec* Toyota doesn’t expect severe logistical problems -exec* Renault, Hyundai, Fuji Heavy, BMW, VW to use Shanghai* Shanghai auto terminal traffic may rise 10 pct -operator (Recasts; adds Renault, Fuji Heavy, Hyundai diversions)By Norihiko Shirouzu and Jake SpringBEIJING, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and rival global automakers are looking to divert shipments to Shanghai and other ports from Tianjin after massive explosions last week disrupted operations indefinitely at China’s largest auto import hub.Authorities have restricted access to areas affected by the Aug. 12 blasts at a hazardous chemicals warehouse which killed at least 114 people. Automakers are struggling to reach lots and warehouses to assess damage and clear thousands of charred cars to make facilities usable, though the port continues to operate.On Wednesday, Renault SA and Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd said they would re-route imports to Shanghai, while Hyundai Motor Co said it would send further shipments to Shanghai and Guangzhou.Toyota is considering re-routing imports to Shanghai and Dalian which have enough capacity to prevent any significant logistical problems, a senior Beijing-based executive said.“Port of Tianjin will likely be unusable for a long while, although I have no idea at the moment how long these disruptions would last,�� said the executive, who was not authorised to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.Toyota suspended its two final assembly lines near Tianjin port on Monday to Wednesday, partly to assess any damage. It made 432,340 cars at the plants last year, and is likely to lose 2,200 a day due to the blasts, said researcher IHS Automotive.A Toyota spokesman in Japan said, without elaborating, that the automaker was looking to re-route shipments to other ports.Tianjin, regarded as a gateway to China’s industrial northeast, handles 40 percent of car imports in the world’s biggest auto market. But the explosions are likely to hamper normal operations for at least a couple of months, said IHS.On Monday, BMW AG said it would re-route shipments to Shanghai, while Volkswagen AG opted for both Shanghai and Guangzhou.Shanghai’s sole auto terminal could see a 10 percent rise in car volume based on queries received since the Tianjin blast, said a marketing official at Shanghai Haitong International Automotive Terminal Co Ltd.The port has an annual capacity of 2 million to 3 million cars, said the official, who declined to be identified.

JOHANNESBURG, Oct 3 (Reuters) - South African automotive parts workers have rejected the latest wage offer from employers aimed at ending a strike that has brought assembly lines to a standstill in Africa’s biggest economy.Jakkie Olivier, chief executive of the Retail Motor Industry, told SAfm radio that management had offered to raise salaries by 10 percent in the first year and 8 percent in the following two years.“We are hugely disappointed with the latest feedback we have received from NUMSA,�� Olivier said, adding that the three-year wage offer was “very reasonable�� given the current economic conditions.NUMSA, South Africa’s main manufacturing union, wants double-digit wage hikes and better shift allowances.General-secretary Irvin Jim said the union was open to more talks with the employers, adding that discussions were at a “critical, critical stage��.Auto manufacturing accounts for 6 percent of South Africa’s GDP and 12 percent of its exports. The strike has also damaged the country’s reputation as destination for foreign direct investment.Car companies affected included BMW, Volkswagen , Toyota and Daimler.

Oct 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday confirmed reports it will scale back a planned plant in Guanajuato, Mexico by 30 percent to $700 million and will cut planned production in half to 100,000 vehicles per year.The automaker in 2015 had announced plans to build a $1 billion plant in Mexico. Toyota spokesman Scott Vazin said the decision to shrink the plant does not “change our long-term commitment to Mexico, however; change is necessary in order to secure the long-term viability of our facility and our operations.�� (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Andrew Hay)	3.032532287
SHANGHAI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it would cut prices of auto parts for its luxury Lexus models in China by an average 26 percent amid increasing scrutiny over anti-trust issues by the country’s regulators.The price cut will be effective from Sept. 1 this year, according to a statement posted on the Lexus website in China.On Wednesday, China fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.2 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices as the government steps up its enforcement of an anti-trust law that has targeted major corporations and revived protectionism concerns.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp will offer free access to its hybrid-vehicle patents through 2030, it said on Wednesday, seeking to expand use of the lower-emission technology even as the global industry shifts toward fully electric cars.The pledge by one of the world’s biggest automakers to share its closely guarded patents, the second time it has opened up a technology, is aimed at driving industry uptake of hybrids and fending off the challenge of all-battery electric vehicles(EVs).Toyota said it would grant licenses on nearly 24,000 patents on technologies used in its Prius, the world’s first mass-produced “green�� car, and offer to supply competitors with components including motors, power converters and batteries used in its lower-emissions vehicles.“We want to look beyond producing finished vehicles,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told reporters.“We want to contribute to an increase in take up (of electric cars) by offering not just our technology but our existing parts and systems to other vehicle makers.”The Nikkei Asian Review first reported Toyota’s plans to give royalty-free access to hybrid-vehicle patents.Terashi said that the access excluded patents on its lithium-ion battery technology.Toyota’s move to unlock its patents underlines its belief that hybrids are an effective alternative to all-battery EVs, given a fuel efficiency roughly double that of gasoline cars, lower cost and that they do not need charging infrastructure.Toyota vehicles account for more than 80 percent of the global hybrid vehicle market.“Toyota has realized that they made a mistake by protecting their hybrid technology for years. This prevented diffusion�� said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.“Toyota on its own can’t get key technology accepted, but if other companies use it, that offers the best chance of expansion,�� she added.Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor.Hybrid vehicles account for around 3 percent of all vehicles sold globally, eclipsing the roughly 1.5 percent share of all-battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive.Global automakers have pledged to electrify their offerings as a growing number of countries slash vehicle emissions by as much as half by 2030, but many say that shifting to fully electric cars will take time given high cost of batteries.Lewis at Macquarie said automakers in China and Europe could be keen to access Toyota’s hybrid-vehicle patents as they look for lower-emission cars to sell in lower-tier cities where costly battery EVs are out of reach for many drivers.Toyota is also betting on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) as the ultimate zero-emissions vehicle, and as a result, has lagged many of its rivals in marketing all-battery EVs.In 2015, it said it would allow access to its FCV-related patents through 2020.	2.130998596
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Rival militiamen battled each other for hours with anti-aircraft guns and grenades across Tripoli on Thursday, killing at least one person and wounding 12 in the worst fighting for months in the Libyan capital, medical sources said.The second outbreak of street fighting within days shows how the government is struggling to contain militias which helped overthrow Muammar Gaddafi two years ago but kept their guns after the NATO-backed uprising.A security source told Reuters that a heavily-armed group from the central city of Misrata had entered the capital in the evening to take revenge for the killing of one of its fighters in a smaller shootout in Tripoli on Tuesday.Gunfire broke out while young people were enjoying a water pipe on the seafront and families were shopping or dining at the start of the weekend.Toyota trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns arrived in several parts of Tripoli, opening fire as they tried to storm the eastern Suq al-Juma district, witnesses said. Panicked diners ran for cover, while drivers abandoned their cars.One woman was shot in the leg, a medical worker said. The Radisson Blu, one of Tripoli’s best hotels, evacuated some guests after windows in the reception area were smashed by stray gunfire, an employee said.Rival militiamen fought back, firing rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) from a bridge. Heavy shooting could be also heard in at least three other districts close to the foreign ministry, state television building and embassies.The conflict started on Tuesday when rival gunmen battled for almost four hours. Three people were wounded and one, a leader of a Misrata militia, later died - prompting the revenge attack as news of his death spread on Facebook.A militia on government payroll had initially arrested the driver of a car without number plates and detained him briefly in a security office in Suq al-Juma. He later came back with friends in armed militia cars, triggering clashes.As fighting spread through the capital, residents carrying guns and RPGs rushed out of their houses searching for the attackers. Others set up several checkpoints to stop more militiamen entering central parts of Tripoli.“They’re stopping any car from Misrata,�� one resident told Reuters, while anti-aircraft rounds flew overhead.Fighters in a Toyota truck mounted with an anti-aircraft gun shouted “Allah Akbar�� (God is great) while driving at great speed near the foreign ministry.In the Suq al-Juma area, residents tore down street lamps to build makeshift barricades to prevent more militiamen entering the area, witnesses said by telephone.Libya’s government is finding it harder to contain former fighters and Islamist militants in a country awash with weapons.Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has sought to co-opt militia that helped topple Gaddafi by integrating them and their weapons from the NATO-backed revolt into the nascent army and police. But in practice, most continue to report to their own commanders or tribes.Strikes and armed protests by militia and tribal gunmen demanding payments or political rights have also shut much of the OPEC member’s oil output for months and deprived the government of its key source of income.	-3.878464317
NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp may be ready to ratchet up its sales outlook for the 2012 U.S. auto market after two months of stronger-than-expected demand in the industry, a top executive at the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday.Toyota is still forecasting U.S. industry sales of 13.6 million this year, but strong January and February demand is causing officials to rethink that prediction, Yoshi Inaba, president and chief operating officer in charge of Toyota’s North American operations, said after a speech in New York.“That may be looking a little bit more conservative,�� he told Reuters after speaking on a panel about recovery from last year’s earthquake and tsunami that damaged the company and others in Japan’s auto industry.Most automakers have resisted increasing their full-year sales estimates for the industry, wanting to see if the strong demand will continue.U.S. auto sales rose nearly 16 percent in February and the annual sales rate leapt to its best level in four years, topping expectations for the second straight month. January sales rose more than 11 percent, or more than twice the rate analysts had expected.Inaba said the industry is on a “steady recovery path�� due to pent-up demand, with the age of vehicles on the road averaging almost 11 years. He credited the strong start to the year to milder winter conditions and lower interest rates.Toyota is still targeting company sales in the U.S. market this year of 1.9 million vehicles, he added.The U.S. annual sales rate, a closely watched industry yardstick, jumped to 15.1 million vehicles in February, the best monthly showing since February 2008, before the financial crisis that sent Detroit into a tailspin. Analysts had expected an annual pace of 14 million vehicles, with the high estimate at 14.4 million.The auto industry is now in its third year of a fitful recovery from a severe slump that led to the bankruptcies of General Motors Co and Chrysler in 2009. The U.S. industry was selling nearly 17 million vehicles a year on average in the 10-year period ending in 2007. Last year, the industry sold 12.8 million vehicles.Meanwhile, Inaba said the economic pressure on automakers globally only continues to grow. He said there will be more deals like the alliance signed last week between GM and Peugeot in an effort to cut costs, in which GM will take a 7 percent stake in the French automaker.“The global market is pushing automakers to do a much better job and therefore pushing to align or cooperate or work together as a common goal,�� Inaba said. “I don’t think this GM/Peugeot thing is the end of it.”Deals could take many forms, whether acquisitions or alliances, he said.	1.21407334
FRANKFURT, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are taking steps to win back business in the competitive European market, bringing out new cars with small fuel-efficient diesel engines and smart interiors.Having seen their sales dwindle while South Korean rivals Hyundai and Kia flourished, Japan’s carmakers have cut costs and invested the profits from a weaker yen to ensure strong European growth over the next few years.Handicapped by earthquakes, tsunamis and floods that disrupted their supply chains around the world two years ago, companies including Mazda and Toyota initially focused on their solid positions in North America, not wanting to adapt their U.S.-centric models.European sales suffered as a result, but their fortunes here are starting to improve now that Japanese carmakers are targeting Europe, the most demanding market in terms of fuel efficiency, design, handling and build quality.“Business has turned around. If you talk to most of the auto companies, it’s doom and gloom but our story is the exact opposite,�� said Jeff Guyton, head of Mazda in Europe, in an interview at Frankfurt’s auto show, which ends this week.Vehicle sales for the brand rose 11 percent in the eight months through August amid a European market that shrank by 5 percent, and average revenue per car sold is on the rise.“We had the best fiscal first quarter in at least 10 years,�� Guyton said.Mazda debuted at the Frankfurt show its Mazda3, a compact fuel-efficient car that competes with Volkswagen’s Golf. Mazda has already enjoyed success with its popular CX-5 crossover, which help lift European turnover since it launched last April.Japanese carmakers have long profited from their reputation for reliability, but were upstaged when Hyundai and Kia brought out a range of stylish, affordable cars tailored to European tastes with extra-long warranties of five or even seven years.This helped the two South Koreans claw European sales away from rivals such as Toyota.“They fundamentally missed the point about European design and interior quality,�� said Mark Hall, who left the Japanese carmaker after 20 years to run Hyundai’s European marketing operations in 2010.While the market share of Kia and Hyundai jumped to 6.1 percent last year in Europe from 3 percent in 2008, Japan’s seven traditional brands slipped to 11.8 from 13.7 percent. It would have been worse had it not been for Nissan’s Qashqai, a compact SUV.The two sibling brands, whose models are both sculpted by a former chief designer for Audi, successfully shed their reputation for ugly cars and unreliable engineering with offerings like the Hyundai i30 hatchback and the Kia Sportage SUV, manufactured in two state-of-the-art European production plants that cost 2.6 billion euros ($3.5 billion) to build.In August, Hyundai even eclipsed Nissan, the most European of the Japanese brands, to become the second best-selling Asian badge in Europe in the year to date after Toyota.Japan’s carmakers are now fighting back, however, improving handling and rolling out more wagons, a bodystyle that is popular among company car owners in many parts of Europe.Toyota is currently launching its Auris Touring Sports estate, while Honda will bring early next year the Civic Tourer, a model developed for the first time by a European and equipped with rear adaptive suspension to meet local demands for a sportier ride.The Japanese carmakers have funded these changes by slimming down their operations. Toyota, for example, shifted all Auris production to its UK plant and moved some production of the Corolla sedan to Turkey from Japan and South Africa.“At the same time that the weakness of the Japanese carmakers was being exploited heavily by the rapidly growing Koreans, the Japanese were busy putting their entire cost base to the test,�� said Ernst &amp; Young’s senior automotive advisory partner Peter Fuss.Toyota’s European automotive operations returned to the black for the first time in six years during fiscal 2012/13, selling 838,000 cars in the 12 months through March.Five years previously it sold a third more cars, but losses ran in the hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Didier Leroy chief executive of Toyota Europe.“Our cost structure was totally wrong,�� he said.Now his European operations are strong enough to withstand a shrinking market as well as headwinds from the pound sterling, Russian rouble and Turkish lira that more than offset the weaker yen and still be able to rake in “a lot more�� than last year’s 246 million euros in profit, he said.“It’s real sustainable growth, this isn’t doing crazy things to secure market share or volume,�� said Leroy.Japan’s carmakers, who like to tout their expertise in hybrids and electric cars, are also finally investing in a competitive lineup of diesel vehicles which constitute half the European market.Toyota will now procure from BMW small 1.6 litre diesels, a popular European size that was missing from its engine range. Honda introduced its own 1.6 litre i-DTEC diesel for the European market, which it says will help provide a further boost to sales of its CR-V crossover and Civic hatch.Mazda’s Guyton sees no reason to be downbeat despite figures that showed Europe’s new car market in the first eight months shrank to the lowest level recorded since 1990.“Two years ago we structured our business to make a profit contribution to the company at 100 yen to the euro and 20 percent less volume than we have right now,�� he said.“Now I’ve got new product, higher revenue and 130 yen to the euro, so we are contributing significantly to the company.��	-0.4083834181
TOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Thursday raised its forecast for annual operating profit by 4.2% due to a slightly weaker yen.Toyota expects operating profit to rise to 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion) in the year to March, up from 2.47 trillion yen the previous year and its earlier forecast of 2.4 trillion yen.The outlook is based on a new assumption for the yen to average around 108 yen to the U.S. dollar versus 107 yen previously.The higher forecast comes even as Toyota posted a 3.2% decline in third-quarter profit, hurt by softer global vehicle sales.Operating profit for Japan’s biggest automaker came in at 654.4 billion yen in the October-December quarter, down from 676.1 billion yen a year ago.	-14.64025026

* Retail stocks outperform* Toyota, Bridgestone, Denso among big losers* Investors eye trade talks, U.S. FedTOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei edged up on Thursday after a weak yen supported overall sentiment, but a profit warning by Germany’s Continental dragged down auto stocks and tire makers.The Nikkei share average rose 0.2 percent to 22,412.90 in midmorning trade.Analysts said that investors are sticking to the sidelines amid Sino-U.S. trade talks and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole.U.S. and Chinese officials met for the first time in over two months to find a way out of their deepening trade conflict, but there was no evidence the low-level discussions would halt a new round of U.S. tariffs due Thursday.U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers will meet at Jackson Hole on Friday to discuss the root causes of stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and tepid productivity gains.“Investors want to find out which direction the market will be taking, whether there will be changes in the momentum after these events,�� said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management.Auto shares, tire makers and autoparts makers weakened after German automotive supplier Continental AG nosedived 13 percent on the back of a profit warning.Toyota Motor Corp fell 1.2 percent, while Nissan Motor Co dropped 1.3 percent, Bridgestone Corp 1.8 percent, Yokohama Rubber 2.3 percent, Denso Corp 3.1 percent and Tokai Rika 2.5 percent.Gainers included discount furniture store operator Nitori Holdings, which jumped 3.3 percent after its August same-store-sales rose 0.7 percent.

PANGKALPINANG, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia’s largest tin miner PT Timah expects to more than double its refined tin production this year but has started taking steps to slow down output, a senior company official said on Thursday.Timah estimates output to reach around 70,000 tonnes this year, said Alwin Albar, operational director at Timah.The increase follows a change in regulations last year that allowed the company to acquire output from illegal miners within their concessions.“We are actually trying to hit the brakes amid this sluggish tin market,�� Albar said in an interview in Pangkalpinang on Bangka Island.Company data showed Timah produced 33,444 tonnes of refined tin in 2018.He said activities at the company’s Batu Besi mine in neighboring Belitung island has now been cut to eight hours from a normally non-stop 24-hour operation.Prices of tin in London has dropped to below $18,000 per tonne this month, down from one-year highs at $21,800 a tonne in February.In 2018, Timah’s average selling price was $20,205 per tonne.Albar, who is also chairman of Indonesia’s tin exporters association (AETI), declined to give company’s price estimate for the rest of the year but said he saw the current downturn in global tin prices as short term.He said electric vehicles would be a future demand boost.“Tin is already being used in automotives, but the portion of use will be much larger in EVs, not to mention in the batteries,�� Albar said. “There will be jump in demand.”International Tin Association, said in a report in February, that lithium-ion batteries could grow to represent a significant new use of tin in 2025-2030.In Indonesia, the government is pushing for development of plants for EVs and components to create a downstream industry for the country’s mineral output such as nickel that can be processed into battery chemicals to be used in EVs.Japanese automaker Toyota has committed to invest $2 billion in Indonesia over the next five years, part of which will be used to produce EVs, Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto said.A number of battery makers have also expressed an initial interest to build plants in Indonesia, a ministry official said.Albar however said he has no timeline yet on when the company expects to start commercial rare earth production.	-0.8866995074

If there is any indication for the future, logically the yen should weaken,�� he said.Nissan has assumed an average dollar rate of 82 yen for the business year ending next March, compared with 80 yen at Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co.	-5.156838143

(Repeats Monday’s story with no changes to text)TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - In the Chinese coastal province of Jiangsu, where supply chains have been shattered by the coronavirus outbreak, one auto supplier has already shifted production of parts for Mazda Motor Corp 13,000 kilometres away to central Mexico’s Guanajuato State.The bid to keep production lines moving comes at a high cost for Japan’s auto industry, already squeezed by an expected downturn in consumer demand in markets such as the United States, China and Japan as the coronavirus crisis deepens.To deal with a Chinese production shortage of a component used in the exterior trim of the Mazda3 and CX-30 models, the auto supplier cranked up output of the part at its Mexico plant by 50%, airlifting the products to Mazda’s assembly line in Japan, a person at the supplier with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.In total, the move has cost Mazda more than $5 million, the person said, citing extra shifts and air freight charges.“Substitute production costs an arm and a leg,�� said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity and asked Reuters not to identify the supplier or the part.“But Mazda doesn’t want to stop production and have asked us to keep our supply coming. They are taking on the expense.”A Mazda spokeswoman said the company was “assessing various countermeasures for swift recovery while minimising the impact on production at the same time��.Although Mexico provided a solution for the Mazda supplier, the country is itself bracing for a supply crunch, with local officials warning that disruptions to parts shipments from China could deal a blow to its own auto manufacturing industry.Many Japanese suppliers also manufacture in the United States, Europe and Asia.As one of Japan’s smaller automakers, Mazda trails rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co in sales and production capacity. To keep costs down, it has for years focused on sharing as many parts as possible across its line-up.Relatively low volumes and the standardised design and production model also give Mazda and its suppliers more flexibility when considering options for shifting production, one Mazda insider said.Larger automakers, which require a higher volumes of parts and typically use a wider variety of components across their models, may, however, find themselves with fewer options.(For an interactive link to major Japanese automakers' sales and production in China, click on tmsnrt.rs/2TEpfLe)The Chinese vehicle sales of Japan’s top three automakers plunged by as much as 85% last month as demand in the world’s top car market took a pummelling from the virus outbreak, prompting China’s automaking association to call on the government for tax cuts and other measures to support sales.Meanwhile, output of LED headlights and tailights at Koito Manufacturing’s plant in China’s Hubei Province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, ground to a halt in February after the Chinese government ordered offices, schools and factories to close.While partial operations resumed last week, the company, the world’s biggest maker of automotive lighting and a supplier to Toyota, Nissan and others, is preparing to move some production elsewhere to fulfil export orders, a Koito spokeswoman said, adding it was discussing arrangements with clients.“There are lamps that we make for vehicle models made in North America, Japan and China, which are fairly similar between those regions,�� she said, declining to give further details about its plans to shift production.Time and cost concerns mean other suppliers will be less keen to follow the example of Koito and the Mazda supplier, despite expectations that it will take months for manufacturing output in China to return to normal.Kasai Kogyo, which supplies Honda with interior door trim and roof parts, said it was looking at the possibility of shifting production from its Wuhan plant to one of the many plants it operates in North America, Europe, and Asia, but added that doing so would drive up costs and take months to organise.The parts it produces are among the largest components used in cars, and are cast from dies, which can be model- and country-specific and difficult to transport because they can weigh hundreds of kilogrammes.“Dies take months to produce, up to a year for bigger ones,�� personnel manager Yohei Shinoda told Reuters.“So the process to shift production of a part from one plant to another isn’t as easy as it may seem.�� (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu and Maki Shiraki; Editing by David Dolan, Kirsten Donovan)	2.472874085
"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Toyota 7203.T, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Ford F.N are the only remaining potential merger candidates for Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI, since its attempt to join up with GM GM.N was rebuffed, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday.Marchionne has long called for mergers of big players in the industry to help spread the costs of developing more technologically advanced cars that pollute less, but his preferred target GM has repeatedly refused to engage in talks.“The door (on M&amp;A) has never closed, the need to consolidate does not go away,�� he said on the sidelines of a shareholder meeting in Amsterdam.However, Ford promptly said it also has no interest in a tie-up with FCA.“As we consistently have said, Ford has no plan or interest other than to continue to accelerate our One Ford plan, deliver product excellence and drive innovation in every part of our business,�� the company said in an emailed statement.Marchionne, whose term as chief executive at FCA is due to run out in 2018, said Korean carmakers were also among the big players in the industry and there would be sufficient synergies to justify a merger, but “the Koreans don’t get married��.The major South Korean carmaker is Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, which also owns nearly 34 percent of Kia Motors Corporation 000270.KS.In the absence of a merger partner, Marchionne has been focusing his efforts on executing an ambitious investment plan centered on revamping its Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands and eliminating FCA’s debt.The CEO said he was open to the possibility of the company starting to pay dividends again before 2018 if the carmaker is first free of debt. FCA had net industrial debt of 5 billion euros at the end of 2015 and expects to be cash positive to the tune of 4-5 bln euros at the end of 2018.Marchionne’s comments about industry consolidation follow a renewed pitch made for an alliance by FCA Chairman John Elkann a day earlier, who said a combination of FCA with one of the “big guys�� could yield annual savings close to $10 billion.""But you need two to tango and most of our competitors are busy with the great opportunities that technological disruption has to offer,"" Elkann said in a letter to shareholders of Exor EXOR.MI, referring to a focus on new developments such as car sharing and self-driving vehicles.Exor is the investment vehicle through which Italy’s Agnelli family controls FCA.Elkann said selling cars would still be a “massive industry�� in 2030, by when new sales are expected to be worth $4 trillion, up from $2.75 trillion in last year.“Boring old car makers need to figure out how to make this profitable,�� he said."	-2.457430341
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Thursday it would investigate Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Panasonic Corp 6752.T and other companies for alleged patent infringement in certain infotainment systems, components and automobiles containing such systems.The investigation was based on a complaint by Broadcom Inc AVGO.O, the commission said in a statement.Other companies to be investigated are Denso Ten America Ltd, a subsidiary of Denso Corp 6902.T; Renesas Electronics Corp 6723.T; and Japan Radio, a unit of Nisshinbo Holdings Inc 3105.T.	-4.045224286
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz will build the first model under its new EQ electric vehicle brand in the northern German city of Bremen by the end of the decade, parent Daimler said on Thursday.Mercedes-Benz and Daimler’s Smart brand aims to launch more than 10 electric cars by 2025, in major push in pure electric vehicles thanks to advances in battery technology and greater consumer acceptance of zero-emissions vehicles.The model to be built in Bremen will be based on the sporty SUV coupe-style EQ vehicle it presented at the Paris auto show last month, Daimler said.The Bremen plant currently makes 10 different models including plug-in hybrids of the C-Class and the GLC SUV. In addition, its fuel-cell operated GLC, likely to compete with Toyota’s Mirai, is to be made at the factory.The battery for the new electric vehicle will be developed by Daimler unit Accumotive and produced in Kamenz in the eastern German state of Saxony.	2.473652121
MUNICH/HAMBURG (Reuters) - BMW BMWG.DE and Toyota 7203.T plan to expand a technological partnership, two sources close to the companies told Reuters, a deal that could prompt a shift in auto industry allegiances.The agreement will be extended to include hybrid power trains and lightweight design, the sources said on Wednesday.However, BMW has not agreed a deal to tap General Motors' GM.N advanced hydrogen fuel cell technology, a spokesman for the German luxury carmaker said.BMW has primarily preferred France's PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA as a partner when it comes to reducing development and production costs.But the cash-strapped French have recently sought savings through an alliance with GM. By aligning more with Toyota, BMW would have a partner that offers greater scale than Peugeot and a financially healthy one at that.BMW will host a news conference at 0630 EDT on Friday to mark a visit from Toyota scion and chief executive Akio Toyoda to the German carmaker’s Munich headquarters.The companies declined to comment on the conference’s subject matter, but the sources said Toyoda and BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer would explain their new ideas. The sources added, however, no contracts have been drafted for them to sign.Eager to bulk up its diesel engine line-up in a sagging European market, Toyota agreed to collaborate with BMW on lithium-ion battery research in exchange for a steady supply of BMW-made diesel engines starting in 2014.This time BMW looks to be the partner in need. Now that Peugeot is devoting resources to cementing an alliance with GM, the joint venture with the French firm on hybrid parts looks shaky.Additionally, BMW, whose hydrogen concept of burning the gas in an internal combustion engine never took off, has failed to reach an agreement to access GM’s technology in this area.“We are still in talks with GM, but no longer about this issue,�� a spokesman said on Wednesday, confirming a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt.A successful partnership with the Detroit-based automaker could have helped build trust with the new large shareholder of PSA.BMW needs to reduce the carbon emissions of its new car fleet by roughly a third, to 101 grams per kilometer, by 2020, which Reithofer argues can only be achieved if it ramps up the number of hybrid and electric cars in its range.“I would bet that there will soon be BMW cars equipped with Toyota’s hybrid power trains,�� one of the sources said.The Japanese carmaker could then gain access to the carbon fiber joint venture with SGL SGCG.DE, which produces cutting-edge lightweight materials that BMW aims to use on an industrial scale to mass produce its Megacity electric car, dubbed the i3.	-3.293182983
TOKYO (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T said on Friday it was considering sourcing vehicle components from outside China, as the spread of a new coronavirus in the country threatens to disrupt vehicle production in its biggest market, India.The Japanese firm is the latest auto maker bracing for disruption in production and supply chains, as the epidemic spreads fast, killing almost 640 people.Its bigger rival Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday production at all of its China plants would remain suspended through Feb. 16, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI said a European plant could close within two weeks if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work soon.Suzuki does not produce or sell any cars in China, but procures some components there for its plants in India, where it controls around half of the passenger vehicle market via its local unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS.Its global car production has not been impacted yet, but Suzuki is looking at the possibility of procuring “made in China�� car parts from other regions if it cannot access parts due to ongoing stoppages, managing officer Masahiko Nagao told reporters.Japan’s fourth-largest automaker said its December quarter operating profit fell 11% to 51.8 billion yen ($471 million), its lowest since the March 2016 quarter and below an average forecast of 58.4 billion by nine analysts.Global vehicle sales slipped 3.7% to 752,000 units due largely to a 7.9% fall in sales at home.Sales in India rose slightly to 407,000 units. Yet it expects its India sales to slide by a fifth this business year, as the industry battles a steep sales contraction following decades of strong demand growth, hit by tighter credit and higher insurance costs.Suzuki said sales during the Indian Diwali holiday season improved, but it would take much more time for demand to recover.The company kept its forecast for full-year operating profit to drop 40% to 200 billion yen, a four-year low.	-13.73471969
JOHANNESBURG, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Toyota is to invest 1 billion rand ($90 million) in production of its Corolla model in South Africa, giving a vote of confidence to the local auto sector after strikes last year led some to reconsider investment in the country.Wage-related stoppages in 2013 prompted BMW to say it was freezing expansion plans in the country and left others in a sector that accounts for 6 percent of GDP considering how much to invest there.But Toyota said on Tuesday it was pressing on with the investment as part of an expansion that began in 2012.“The ... investment is the second to be announced in the current phase of capital expansion that started with the 363 million rand new parts distribution centre in Gauteng in 2012,�� Toyota said in a statement.However Toyota South Africa President and Chief Executive Johan van Zyl acknowledged last year’s production disruption had damaged the company’s reputation.“We will have to work hard to find a mutually beneficial solution with our labour partners to stabilise production for both the local and export market,�� he added.

TOKYO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Japanese shares fell on Wednesday on worries over the progress of trade talks between Washington and Beijing, with the information technology sector recording the biggest decline led by falls in semiconductor companies.U.S. President Donald Trump threatened an escalation in the trade war on Tuesday when he said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal was reached with Beijing.The Nikkei index closed down 0.62% at 23,148.57.Trump’s comments, which he made at a cabinet meeting at the White House, further dented hopes for a resolution to a 16-month long trade war that has curbed global trade.The United States and China have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs that have roiled financial markets and threatened to drag growth in the global economy to its lowest rate since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.Sticking points include how and when to reduce tariffs and how much U.S. agricultural products China would commit to buy.“There is a lot of uncertainty about the U.S.-China trade war, including Trump’s comments,�� said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co.“It would certainly benefit both sides to have a trade deal, so I think they will eventually agree to something. But for the time being, it’s a good opportunity for some overseas investors to sell stocks and book some profits.”Some traders are also worried about a further deterioration in U.S.-China relations after the U.S. Senate, in a unanimous vote, passed legislation on Tuesday to protect human rights in Hong Kong, which has been rocked by violent protest against Chinese rule of the former British colony.China’s foreign ministry said it strongly condemned the measure.The IT sector was the biggest decliner, led by Advantest Corp, down 2.7%, and a 1.57% decline in shares of Tokyo Electron Ltd.Major exporters Honda Motor Co Ltd fell 1.34% and Toyota Motor Corp dropped 0.85%.There were 89 advancers on the Nikkei index against 128 decliners on Wednesday.The largest percentage losses in the index were cargo shipping firm Nippon Yusen KK down 4.18%, followed by life insurer T&amp;D Holdings Inc losing 4.02% and oil refining equipment maker JGC Holdings Corp down by 3.71%.The largest percentage gainers in the index were Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co Ltd up 6.95%, followed by online commerce company Rakuten Inc gaining 2.62% and healthcare company M3 Inc up by 2.48%.The Topix index fell 0.33% to 1,691.11, its biggest decline since Nov. 14.The volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board was 1.35 billion, compared with the average of 1.25 billion yen in the past 30 days.

BERLIN, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Fuel-cell technology is becoming cheaper and will be commercially viable for mass use in cars by 2025, a senior executive at auto industry supplier Robert Bosch said on Friday.Non-polluting fuel-cell cars have failed to gain widespread acceptance because of prohibitive development costs, even though they can run five times longer than electric cars and take far less time to refuel.By 2025 fuel cell production will be more industrialised, bringing down costs thanks to greater economies of scale, Wolf-Henning Scheider, head of Bosch’s automotive division, told an industry conference in Berlin.“They are not out of the race. They are a viable alternative to other zero-emission vehicle technologies,�� Scheider told Reuters.Though Scheider said that fuel-cell powertrains are still likely to be twice as expensive to produce than those for electric cars in 2025, he expects the higher operating range of fuel-cell cars to make them a viable alternative.Daimler, Hyundai, Nissan, Ford, Toyota, Honda and General Motors are all developing fuel-cell vehicles.Toyota and Honda plan to start selling fuel-cell vehicles next year.Fuel-cell technology combines hydrogen with oxygen in the air to generate electricity. The only emissions are water vapour and heat, but the technology has been held back by high costs and lack of infrastructure.The first fuel-cell cars on the market are expected to be priced at about $70,000, but analysts say that does not cover manufacturers�� development costs, nor the expense of buidling filling stations at more than $1 million each.Electric cars are far less expensive and can be charged at home, work or on the road, but they can travel only 100-200km (62-124 miles) on a single charge.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to finish the year at a fast pace, with demand possibly at its highest in November, but Wall Street remains worried the industry could return to overly generous incentives that would eat into profits.Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters see the annual sales rate for U.S. new-vehicle sales in November finishing at 15.6 million vehicles. And some analysts said the rate could top 16 million, which would mark the strongest pace of the year.“Our marketing is there, our inventories are good, our product is really good; we just need a good finish,�� Tim Coad, owner of Coad Family Dealerships in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, said in a telephone interview.Coad said sales at his Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota stores are on pace to match last year’s strong results.Monthly sales are regarded as an early indicator of the U.S. economy’s health. The industry has held up better than the broader economy because of easier access to credit and consumers�� need to replace aging vehicles, which now average more than 11 years.But some analysts are worried about rising incentives biting into companies�� profit margins. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said General Motors Co executives at the LA Auto Show last week agreed “there are some warning signs brewing in industry sales momentum and discipline�� with incentives heating up.RBC Capital Markets sees industry incentives up 4 percent in November over last year, and analysts and industry officials cited generous or rising offers from Ford Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co, GM and Toyota Motor Corp. Ford’s incentives on its F-150 pickups were up 12 percent, according to Barclays and Buckingham Research Group.Meanwhile, GM is touting its Black Friday sales deals where consumers can buy certain Chevy, Buick and GMC models at prices paid by employees of suppliers. Coad said the deals are not as crazy as prior decades when he saw offers of up to $10,000 off.GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company headed into November with incentives that were below the industry average and that gave it “room to maneuver.”The U.S. auto industry is scheduled to report November sales on December 3, and analysts who closely follow the industry see sales rising in a range of 3.6 percent to 6.8 percent as demand returns to “normal�� after the 16-day government shutdown hurt October results.John Humphrey, senior vice president of J.D. Power’s global auto practice, said consumer spending on new cars is likely to top $370 billion this year, which would be the highest on record and above pre-recession levels. That includes more than $30 billion in November, when the research firm expects the annual sales pace to hit 16.1 million vehicles.Not everyone is as optimistic about November. Honda Motor Co’s U.S. sales chief John Mendel told reporters last Friday that while sales will rise thanks to the month’s five weekends including Thanksgiving, it “does not look as robust as everyone is saying.�� He expects Honda’s sales to increase 3 percent.The three U.S. automakers are all expected to show gains in the month, marked by continued strong end-of-the-year demand for full-size pickup trucks like GM’s Chevy Silverado, Ford’s F-150 and Chrysler Group’s Ram.Sales at GM are expected to rise 8 percent to 15 percent, while those at Chrysler are seen increasing 7 percent to 10 percent helped by the first full month of availability of its new Jeep Cherokee mid-sized sport utility vehicle. Ford’s sales are predicted to rise 3 percent to 6.7 percent.Kelley Blue Book expects demand in the month for compact crossover utility vehicles and large pickups to rise almost 24 percent and 8 percent, respectively.Most analysts and industry executive expect U.S. overall U.S. sales this year to finish at 15.5 million to 15.6 million vehicles, up from 14.5 million last year. Barclays and J.D. Power predict sales in 2014 will rise again, hitting 16.2 million and 16.1 million respectively.RBC surveyed dealers and 45 percent said they were somewhat or significantly more optimistic about the next six months, up from 42 percent last month.However, Toyota’s North American chief Jim Lentz said last week that the pent-up demand that has driven the industry to strong growth the last few years will slow in 2014.	-2.659531986
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp lifted its operating profit guidance on Wednesday in a widely expected move, as a weaker yen increases the value of sales overseas and makes up for slumping demand at home.The yen’s decline has been a boon for Toyota, which exports roughly half of its vehicles produced in Japan. Cost-cutting undertaken when the yen hovered at record highs in recent years has also helped the automaker’s bottom line.The world’s biggest automaker now expects record profit of 2.70 trillion yen ($22.93 billion) for the year ending March 31. That is 8 percent higher than the previous forecast of 2.5 trillion yen and compares with the 2.762 trillion yen average estimate of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The revised guidance puts Toyota’s operating profit margin forecast at 10.0 percent from 9.4 percent based on the previous projection.“This is the result of our efforts started during the strong-yen era to boost per-vehicle profitability and lower fixed costs,�� Managing Officer Takuo Sasaki said of the margin.For October-December, Toyota said operating profit grew 27 percent to 762.88 billion yen, versus the 690.21 billion yen estimate of 15 analysts. It also changed its U.S. dollar-yen exchange rate assumption to 109 yen for the current year, from 104 yen.In the United States, Toyota’s biggest market, the automaker has outperformed Japanese rivals thanks to a line-up that spans all vehicle categories. Cheaper fuel has hit sales of the Prius and other green models but fanned demand for its Lexus luxury brand, pickup trucks and other high-margin vehicles where Japanese peers have fewer offerings.On Wednesday, the company nudged up its annual sales forecast for North America to 2.75 million vehicles from 2.74 million, while trimming its projections for Japan, Asia and Europe.Company watchers are now awaiting the end of Toyota’s three-year freeze on new factories through March 2016, aimed at preventing unchecked expansion. In the meantime, capacity constraints are widely expected to curb sales growth.Last month, Toyota said it expects its global sales to drop 1 percent this calendar year, dragged down by a sharp decline in Japan, where car sales are dwindling due to the lingering effect of a sales tax hike last April.Shares of Toyota ended 2.4 percent higher ahead of the earnings announcement, versus a 2.0 percent gain in the benchmark index.($1 = 117.7300 yen)	1.665661743
TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s benchmark stock index rallied to a 13-month high on Friday before paring much of those gains, as markets were buffeted by conflicting reports on how much progress has been made in U.S.-China trade negotiations.Earnings at Japan Inc. also swayed sentiment, with the Nikkei average up 0.1% at 23,352.10, after climbing to as high as 23,591.09 - the highest point since Oct. 10 of last year. For the week, the index was on track to log a 2.2% gain for what would be its fifth consecutive weekly rise.The broader Topix advanced 0.15% to 1,700.68, its highest in more than a year.The Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday that the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases, which was confirmed by a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Yet, in an interview with Fox Business Network that underlined the fluid nature of the talks, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissed suggestions of a roll-back in tariffs.“There is no agreement at this time to remove any of the existing tariffs as a condition of the phase one deal,�� he said.In Tokyo, there was still plenty for investors to focus on as Japanese earnings moved into full swing.Shares of companies with solid earnings spiked. Terumo rose 13.4% to record highs after the medical equipment maker posted strong earnings in the three months to September.Isetan Mitsukoshi jumped 11.0% after the department store operator posted upbeat quarterly earnings and announced share buyback.Kirin Holdings gained 9.2% after the beer and beverage maker announce share buy-back totalling up to 6.8% of its shares.Toyota rose 1.8% to hit four-year highs, helped by its release of a share buyback plan and estimates-beating quarterly results.On the other hand, Shiseido shed 7.5% after the cosmetics maker cut its outlook on poor sales in South Korea and Hong Kong.Rakuten dropped 4.2% as its quarterly operating profit was almost wiped out in the three months ended September as investment in its e-commerce and mobile units weighed on profits, with the value of its bet on ride-hailing firm Lyft also sliding further.Mercari lost 17.3% after the internet shopping service operator’s earnings underwhelmed investors.

* Funds to top up Toyota expansion announced last July* Lexus hybrid will be first hybrid built in Canada* Expanded output, hybrid manufacture set for 2014* Ottawa funds to come from Automotive Innovation FundJan 23 (Reuters) - The Canadian and Ontario governments will invest up to C$34 million ($34 million) to help re-tool a Toyota Motor Corp plant in Cambridge, Ontario, to help it expand output and produce a hybrid version of the Lexus sport utility vehicle.It will be the first hybrid to be built in Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in announcing the investment at the southern Ontario plant on Wednesday, along with Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty.The federal and provincial governments will each provide up to C$16.9 million.“Our government is committed to helping Canada’s automotive sector remain globally competitive and prosperous,�� Harper said.Toyota announced last July that it will invest more than C$100 million to expand Lexus production in Canada. The government funds will add to this investment.The expansion will increase Lexus manufacturing capacity by 30,000 vehicles to 104,000 units annually, including 15,000 Lexus RX450h hybrid electric vehicles, and create 400 new jobs at the Cambridge plant.Expanded output is expected to kick off in early 2014.The Cambridge factory is the only Toyota factory outside of Japan that makes Lexus models.The funds provided by Ottawa will come from its Automotive Innovation Fund, which was set up in 2008 with an initial C$250 million of government money for research and development projects in Canada’s auto industry. The government earlier this month injected another C$250 million into the fund and extended it for five years.Toyota will need to repay the federal government’s portion of the funds, but not the portion from the Ontario government, said Toyota spokesman Greig Mordue.	3.843743472
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co is on track to be the most profitable of Japan’s three big automakers this year, after record car sales last year and improved market share in every major region pushed up quarterly operating profit.Nissan kept its net profit forecast at 290 billion yen ($3.77 billion) for the year to end-March, ahead of Honda Motor Co’s forecast for 215 billion yen and Toyota Motor Corp’s 200 billion yen.“It looks like the company is doing pretty well compared to Toyota and Honda,�� said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, CEO of Investrust, noting Nissan’s 9-month operating profit now totaled 84 percent of its annual target.“These were positive results, but I’m not sure Nissan’s share price will gain like Toyota did today. The upward (forecast) revision from Toyota led to hopes for the next financial year, but Nissan seems like it’s going at cruising speed,�� he added.Toyota shares surged 5 percent to a more than 6-month high on Wednesday, a day after the company increased its annual profit forecast by more than a third. It was the stock’s biggest one-day percentage gain in almost 11 months.Nissan also kept its forecast for full-year operating profit of 510 billion yen, below a 547 billion yen consensus forecast in a poll of 25 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Nissan reports under Japanese accounting standards, with earnings from China included in operating income, while its two main rivals report under U.S. accounting rules, with their China earnings included in net income.Despite launching few new models, Nissan increased its global auto sales by 14 percent last year to 4.67 million vehicles, and CEO Carlos Ghosn, who also heads partner Renault SA, aims to achieve the scale he says top automakers need to invest in future technologies.Nissan sold more than 1.2 million vehicles in the quarter, up 19.5 percent, helping revenue grow 11 percent to 2.33 trillion yen.October-December operating profit edged up 3.6 percent to 118.1 billion yen ($1.54 billion), slightly below the average estimate of 122.6 billion yen from 10 analysts polled by Reuters. Net profit rose 3.2 percent to 82.67 billion yen.Among Japan’s three leading automakers, Nissan was the fastest to recover from both the earthquake last March and flooding in Thailand that ruptured supply chains, swiftly sourcing parts from its global network.Nissan said it lost just 33,000 vehicles of output from the Thai floods, while Toyota and Honda each lost more than 200,000.The popularity of new models such as the Rogue and Juke crossovers also helped Nissan gain on its rivals.Combined Renault-Nissan sales, plus those of Renault’s Russian affiliate AvtoVAZ, rose 10 percent to top 8 million vehicles, ranking third worldwide behind General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG, and ahead of Toyota.With the launch of 20 new or reconfigured models globally over the next 24 months, Nissan has flagged more growth, particularly in the United States, where its strong-selling Altima sedan will be refreshed this year.Nissan is also hedging aggressively against the impact of the strong yen, with plans to shift production of the Infiniti JX, Rogue and Murano SUVs out of Japan, and increase the ratio of parts sourced overseas for Japan-made cars.Nissan had planned to double the ratio of foreign-sourced parts to 40 percent by 2013 from 2009 levels, but Corporate Vice President Joji Tagawa said on Wednesday those plans would move faster given the yen’s further appreciation.“Given the current level of the yen, we are looking to accelerate these plans,�� he told a news conference.Nissan aims to achieve an operating profit margin of 8 percent by the end of a six-year business plan that runs through March 2017, assuming a dollar rate of 85 yen. Nissan forecasts a margin of 5.4 percent this year, assuming the dollar at 79.9.Nissan shares have gained about 11 percent in 2012, lagging both Toyota, which is up 21 percent, and Honda, up 20 percent. The main Topix index is up nearly 7 percent.Nissan rose 2.4 percent on Wednesday ahead of its results, compared with a 1.2 percent rise in the Topix.($1 = 76.8800 Japanese yen)	2.349159248
(Corrects when Honda reported earnings in eighth paragraph)TOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - Japan’s three biggest carmakers are expanding a huge global recall triggered by potentially fatal air bags made by Takata Corp, saying on Wednesday they will take back millions of vehicles worldwide for investigation.Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co said they are recalling some 6.5 million vehicles globally, while Honda Motor Co Ltd said it would follow suit, without giving details.Wednesday’s announcements raise to roughly 31 million the number of vehicles recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata air bag inflators, which can erupt with too much force, spraying shrapnel inside the car.The Takata-linked recalls top the largest U.S. recall of 21 million vehicles by Ford Motor Co in the 1980s for a parking gear problem, according to U.S. safety regulators and safety advocates. General Motors recalled about 30 million vehicles last year, but those were for a range of defects, including faulty ignition switches.U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said Toyota and Nissan as well as Japanese government officials have been in contact with the U.S. safety agency over the last few days, and NHTSA will soon announce “significant new steps�� related to accelerating Takata recalls.“While precise root cause remains undetermined, the clear association with high humidity has suggested that moisture and time are factors in this defect,�� Trowbridge said.Asked about the latest recalls, a Takata spokeswoman said a probe into the causes for the air bag defects was ongoing and that the company continued to cooperate with the automakers.Six deaths have been linked to the defective Takata airbags, all on cars made by Honda, which announced disappointing profit forecasts last month citing high quality-related costs.Toyota and Nissan said their recalls were precautionary and that no accidents or injuries had been reported.They did not give further details about the suspected defects, but in documents submitted to Japan’s transport ministry, the automakers said they had identified problems with inflators that were not sufficiently sealed and that were at risk of allowing in moisture during extended use.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, said it would recall just under 5 million Corolla, Vitz and other models, mostly in Japan and Europe.Many of the models were built between March 2003 and November 2007, and include 1.36 million to be recalled in Japan.Nissan said it was recalling about 1.56 million cars globally over the same problem. It did not give details about the models affected.Takata faces multiple class action lawsuits in the United States and Canada as well as a U.S. criminal investigation and a regulatory probe.The company said last week it expects to return to profit in the business year started in April even though it has made few provisions for costs related to the massive global recall.

SEOUL (Reuters) - At last February's Super Bowl, Hyundai Motor 005380.KS hired 'X-Men' movie star Ryan Reynolds for an ad plugging the new version of its Elantra sedan. Not in the script: a slide in first-half sales of the South Korean automaker's U.S. mainstay.When the previous redesign hit the United States in 2011, sporty styling at an attractive price helped it take on Japanese rivals like the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla. At the Elantra's peak, more than one car in every 20 sold in America was a Hyundai, cementing the firm's place as the world's fifth-biggest automaker combined with sister company Kia Motors 000270.KS.But not even a Hollywood superhero could shield the new Elantra from structural change in the U.S. auto market. Hyundai’s aspiration to sell premium cars saw it deliver a more sedate Elantra this year with a higher price - just as American buyers turned away from sedans, rediscovering a taste for gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles in a world of low oil prices.From being Hyundai’s top U.S. seller last year, Elantra sales skidded 25 percent in first-half 2016, trailing a 7 percent drop in its market segment, according to data from the company and Autodata Corp. On Tuesday, Hyundai said net profit fell for the 10th straight quarter, warning the U.S. market is about to get tougher still.“I have built my sales and my reputation at Hyundai as being the value brand,�� said Scott Fink, chief executive of Hyundai of New Port Richey, Florida, the biggest U.S. Hyundai dealership. “I understand the company’s desire to move upstream...but now you’re in the same ocean with Toyota and Honda, and Toyota and Honda most specifically in the U.S. have a much longer and better reputation than Hyundai, and we’re not there yet.”Fink, a member of Hyundai’s U.S. dealer council, said the firm “moved too quickly�� in attempting to raise prices for its cars. “U.S. dealers are disappointed by the sales performance of the 2017 Elantra,�� he said, referring to the latest model in a phone interview with Reuters.Hyundai has invested in marketing since the late January launch, expanding the Elantra line-up. It said U.S. Elantra sales have steadily improved month on month, describing sales in the first half of July were “very strong��.Zayong Koo, Hyundai vice president in charge of investor relations, told an earnings conference on Tuesday that sales incentives to coax buyers into showrooms jumped in the first half, without saying how much the promotions affected profitability.In the first half, Hyundai sold 374,000 cars in the United States, up 0.8 percent from a year earlier, bolstered by sales of its Tucson SUV.PAYING FOR ‘PAYCATIONS’Under its “Paycation�� program, Hyundai is now offering sales with zero payments until 2017 on the new Elantra, as well as car loan financing with a low annual percentage interest rate of 0.9 percent for up to 60 months.Offering incentives to stimulate buyers comes at a financial cost that Hyundai will have to soak up. But its shrinking U.S. market share highlights the need for action.In 2011, on the strength of the previous generations of the Elantra - which dates back to 1990 - and the larger Sonata sedan, Hyundai’s U.S. market share peaked at 5.1 percent. But the Elantra’s fall from grace, along with a slow start for a 2014 redesign of the Sonata criticized as staid, means Hyundai’s market share has now been squeezed back to 4.3 percent, its lowest since the 2009 economic downturn.The falling popularity of sedans versus SUVs and crossover vehicles that span the two categories has hit Hyundai harder than peers. Sedans accounted for 73 percent of Hyundai’s U.S. sales in the first half of this year, while the portion was 42 percent for the industry, according to Autodata.The redesigned styling of its sedans is more “mature��, the company says.For Dave Sullivan, an analyst at consultancy AutoPacific, “The Elantra followed much of the Sonata’s styling...The market is deciding that sedans need to be more compelling than ever to win over buyers who are turning to crossovers at a skyrocketing rate.”BRAND ‘STIGMA’As it continues sponsorship of the NFL American football league - complete with Super Bowl ads - to maintain its U.S. consumer profile, Hyundai is attempting to kickstart a revival by starting to make its Santa Fe SUV at its Alabama factory.In the meantime, at an average sale price of $19,978, the new Elantra is still cheaper than competitors like Honda Motor Co's 7267.T Civic, but more expensive than Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Corolla, according to data provided by Edmunds.com. But an Elantra still costs 15.3 percent more in 2016 than it did in 2010, compared with an 8.7 percent rise for the segment overall, according to Edmunds.com.“Hyundai is still seen as a value brand but their proposition has weakened over time as their prices have gone up while their exterior style has stood out less,�� said Jessica Caldwell, executive director at Edmunds.com.“Once the market has identified a company as a value brand, that stigma is hard to shake, and corporate images take a long time to change,�� Caldwell said.	7.28045582

BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp said on Monday it sold 9,511 vehicles in China in October, down 45 percent from a year earlier, as consumers shunned Japanese brands following a flare up in anti-Japanese sentiment due to a diplomatic row between the two countries.The declined was steeper than the 35 percent fall marked in September.In the first ten months of the year, sales fell 9 percent from a year ago to 157,627 cars, it said.Japanese car makers suffered the backlash from a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo, with Mazda’s bigger rivals all posting steep sales decline In China last month.Toyota Motor Corp’s China sales fell 44 percent in October from a year ago, while Honda Motor Co Ltd fell 54 percent and Nissan Motor Co.

MEXICO CITY, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Mexico’s national statistics agency INEGI said on Wednesday it will start tallying domestic auto production, exports and sales data in October, taking over the job of reporting the monthly figures from the auto industry association AMIA.The statistics agency will publish “monthly sales, production and export data of new vehicle units by company, without specifying monetary values, and the number of vehicles of each of the brands and models that are produced and/or marketed in Mexico,�� INEGI and AMIA said in a joint statement.In total, 2,617,330 autos were produced in Latin America’s No. 2 economy in the first eight months of the year, a rise of just 0.1 percent from the same period in 2017.U.S. carmakers General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co , and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles; Germany’s Volkswagen AG; and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp , Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor co all build autos in Mexico.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen Group's VOWG_p.DE deliveries rose 0.9 percent to a record 10.83 million last year, the German company said on Friday, putting it neck-and-neck with Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi in the race to be the world's biggest vehicle manufacturer.Rivals Toyota Motor 7203.T and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi have not released 2018 registration figures, but the Franco-Japanese alliance sold 10.6 million vehicles in 2017 and racked up sales of 5.54 million in the first half of 2018. Toyota last month released a forecast for total global sales of 10.55 million vehicles last year, but has yet to confirm official numbers.“If we assume that the 10.8 million sales VW have reported is confirmed, it is very likely to be enough to place Volkswagen Group in the number one spot,�� said David Oakley, an analyst at LMC Automotive.That would be the fifth consecutive year Volkswagen Group has held the position, Oakley said, adding it was too early to say whether Toyota or Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi would be in second place, also because registration figures have not yet been published for all markets.Volkswagen Group’s figures include sales of light vehicles and trucks. Measured by passenger cars alone, registrations last year would have accounted for 10.1 million, it said.“If we looked at passenger cars only, the picture would be roughly similar. Volkswagen Group would still be ahead, although by a wider margin, as it is relatively less reliant on light commercial vehicles than the other two,�� Oakley said.Only around 4 percent of Volkswagen Group’s sales were light commercial vehicles in 2018 compared with 12 to 15 percent for Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Toyota Group, according to LMC.If heavy goods vehicles were included in addition to light trucks and passenger cars, Volkswagen would still be ahead and Toyota would be in second place, Oakley said.Volkswagen said the VW brand delivered 6.24 million vehicles last year, while premium brands Audi NSUG.DE and Porsche posted registrations of 1.81 million and 256,000 respectively.This makes Audi the third biggest selling premium brand behind BMW, which delivered 2,125,026 cars and leader Mercedes-Benz, which sold 2.31 million passenger cars.Volkswagen said the ongoing trade dispute with the United States had dampened the business climate in China, its most important market, over the second half of 2018.Volkswagen’s head of sales, Christian Dahlheim, said in a webcast on Friday that he expected demand in China to remain stable in 2019, although the first quarter would be challenging.Separately, Dahlheim said the German carmaker did not foresee a significant financial impact in 2019 from the implementation of the new WLTP emissions standard, which cost the company 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in 2018.Volkswagen Group said December deliveries fell 8.4 percent, to 916,200 vehicles, from 999,900 a year earlier.December group deliveries to China dropped by 12.5 percent year-on-year, the Wolsburg-based carmaker said, adding deliveries also fell by 5.6 percent in Europe and by 3.4 percent in the United States.	-6.57149693
DETROIT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports on Thursday turned up the pressure on automakers to include automatic emergency braking (AEB) as standard on new U.S. models by withholding its 2019 annual top vehicle picks from best-selling brands like General Motors Co’s Chevrolet.“We’ve been pushing for this feature for a long time because it’s very good at preventing crashes,�� Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports�� senior director of automotive testing, told Reuters. “We have telegraphed for some time that this was coming.”Millions of prospective auto buyers consult the magazine’s rankings, which are based on road testing, reliability, safety and owner satisfaction scores.A growing number of new vehicle models now include AEB as standard, including Subaru Corp’s Ascent, Consumer Reports�� 2019 top pick for the midsize SUV category.Last year Chevrolet, GM’s best-selling brand, won top picks for its fully-electric compact Bolt sedan and its full-size Impala sedan.GM, which constantly stresses it is aiming for “zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion,�� did not respond to a request for comment.This year’s top picks included several wins for Toyota Motor Corp, including for its full-size Avalon hybrid electric sedan and the Toyota Prius. Subaru won for its compact Forester SUV and its mid-size Ascent SUV.Tesla Inc’s rollout of its mass-market Model 3 electric sedan hurt the brand’s overall standing, knocking it down 11 spots to No. 19 out of 33 brands ranked by Consumer Reports.Fisher said Tesla’s ramp-up of production of the Model 3 had been accompanied by rising reports of problems with the car’s body, interior, windows and paint, though he added Model 3 owners said they love their vehicles despite reliability issues.Those reliability issues mean that Consumer Reports no longer recommends the Model 3, Fisher said.Subaru was ranked as Consumer Reports�� top car brand, followed by Hyundai Motor Co’s luxury Genesis then Volkswagen AG units Porsche and Audi in third and fourth place respectively. Toyota’s luxury Lexus brand ranked fifth.GM’s Chevrolet brand was ranked 23rd, while the Cadillac brand ranked 26th and GMC 27th.Ford Motor Co’s Ford brand ranked 20th and its Lincoln brand 8th, but its best-selling F-150 pickup truck was named best pickup.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Chrysler brand ranked 22nd, with its Dodge brand 25th and Jeep brand in 29th place.The automaker’s Fiat unit finished last among 33 brands rated.	-1.09177475

* Nikkei sheds 1.21%, brushes 9-day low* Strong yen hits exporters, lower yields weigh on financialsTOKYO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei hit a nine-day low on Thursday as resurgent global recession fears triggered a Wall Street slide and sent the safe-haven yen higher, weighing heavily on the country’s export firms.The Nikkei share average ended the day down 1.21% at 20,405.65. During the day, it touched 20,184.85, its lowest since Aug. 6.All three major U.S. indexes closed down about 3% on Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow posting its biggest one-day point drop since October, after the U.S. Treasury yield curve temporarily inverted for the first time in 12 years -considered a classic recession signal.“Market confidence has already been deteriorating steadily due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict and the Treasury yield curve inversion looks to have pushed sentiment over the edge,�� said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.Shares of Japanese exporters retreated as the safe-haven yen strengthened against the dollar due to the widespread risk aversion.Toyota Motor Corp fell 0.9%, Honda Motor Co dropped 1.4%, Panasonic shed 2.6% and Bridgestone Corp was down 1.1%.Financial institutions also took a hit, as the sharp drop in bond yields was seen hurting their profitability. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group lost 1.1%, Mizuho Financial Group retreated 0.5% and Dai-ichi Life Holdings sank 1.6%.Energy-related shares declined as crude oil prices fell on the back of global recession concerns. Refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co dropped 1.9% and natural gas and oil developer Inpex Corp pulled back 1.8%.The few gaining stocks included robotics company Cyberdyne Inc, which rallied 4.9% after its April-June pretax profit returned to the black with its medical robotic suits finding demand at home and abroad.The broader Topix was down 1.04% at 1,483.85.Declining shares outnumbered gainers by 1,812 to 272.All of Tokyo’s 33 sub-indexes were in the red, with oil and coal products and precision machinery the biggest losers.

(Adds details on investors, background)* Biggest approved project was for Toyota Motor* Another involves China’s SAIC and Thailand’s CP* Junta leader Gen. Prayuth chaired investment board meetingBANGKOK, June 18 (Reuters) - Thailand’s investment agency said on Wednesday it approved applications for 18 projects worth about 120 billion baht ($3.7 billion), mainly in the auto industry, at its first board meeting after the May 22 military coup.The largest approval was for Toyota Motor Corp., which plans to spend 51.5 billion baht for production of pickup trucks and parts, the Board of Investment (BOI) said in a statement.Wednesday’s meeting was chaired by the junta’s leader, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha.Also approved were a tyre production project worth 18.9 billion baht by LLIT (Thailand) and production of coated steel sheets worth 10 billion baht by Posco Coated Steel (Thailand), the BOI said.Another approved plan was for investment of 9.2 billion baht by a joint venture of SAIC Motor Corp. of China and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group, for car production.Thailand is a regional vehicle production and export base for the world’s top car manufacturers. Domestic auto sales in Thailand tumbled 38 percent in May from a year earlier, the Federation of Thai Industries said on Wednesday.One approved plan, from Luxemburg’s Supernap International SA’s, is for a 6.9 billion baht investment in a data centre.The projects endorsed on Wednesday are among big applications awaiting approval. The military government said early this month that backlogged applications for local and foreign investors to invest more than $21 billion would be acted on within two months.The army seized power in a bid to restore order and business confidence after months of political unrest hurt consumption and investment.The total value of investment applications fell 42 percent to 308 billion baht in the first five months of this year from a year earlier. Within that, foreign investment requests dropped 10 percent to 230 billion baht.The junta has announced measures it hopes will get the sputtering economy going again. It is seeking to fast-track infrastructure spending, which has been derailed by the political crisis.On Wednesday, Thailand’s central bank cut this year’s growth forecast nearly by half to 1.5 percent but it saw a much brighter 2015 as the military government tries to reinvigorate the economy.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T presented the Brazilian government on Tuesday with a preliminary plan to establish a local factory building hybrid vehicles in exchange for new tax incentives.That could make Toyota the first company producing such cars in Brazil, where high production costs, a huge sugar ethanol industry and a market focused on entry-level subcompacts have marginalized the role of electric and hybrid vehicles.Toyota would initially increase imports of hybrids. The company began selling its hybrid Prius to the Brazilian public in January at a cost of more than 120,000 reais ($55,000).“The initial idea would be to import and later produce locally,�� Luiz Carlos Andrade Jr, a senior vice-president for Toyota, told journalists in Brasilia.“A technology like this needs to be incentivized,�� he said after a meeting with finance ministry officials. “We presented the possibility of making hybrid vehicles in the country.”National carmaker association Anfavea proposed in early July that Brazil eliminate an industrial tax for manufacturers of electric and hybrid cars through 2017.Government officials made no public comments on Toyota’s proposal.	-1.735257985
* Lexus imports cars from Japan for China market* Tariffs on imports a handicap* Infiniti says China production can start out more costlyBEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - The head of Lexus, the premium brand of Toyota Motor Corp, said on Sunday an emphasis on quality had kept it from manufacturing in China.Unlike German peers Audi, Volkswagen AG’s luxury division and BMW, Lexus imports all of its vehicles sold in China, from Japan.But high tariffs charged on imported cars make it hard to generate volume and last year, Lexus sold around a seventh of Audi’s tally and a fifth of what BMW sold in China.Tokuo Fukuichi, the head of relative newcomer Lexus, said at the Auto China car show that he prioritises the quality of vehicles over quantity.“The German Three have a brand image that they have cultivated over the past century in their long history, but Lexus is not in people’s minds like that yet,�� said Fukuichi, who is also Toyota’s Senior Managing Officer, referring to Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.“Customers would leave us if we have any problems with quality because that is what they are seeking in a Lexus,�� he told Reuters.Fukuichi said that Lexus has been considering the possibility of manufacturing in China but no specifics were being discussed and nothing has been decided.Lexus, which was launched in 1989, took nearly 15 years to start manufacturing outside of Japan at a plant in Canada. It still makes much of its vehicles in Japan but last year it said it will also start production in its biggest market, the United States, in 2015.Its choice to import its vehicles into China, Lexus’s second biggest market, has kept prices high. The entry-level Lexus ES, the brand’s best-selling vehicle in China, has a starting price of about $57,700 there, compared to $36,620 in the United States.Other Japanese premium brands have already made a move to start production in China.Nissan is set to start manufacturing its luxury arm Infiniti’s Q50 sedan and QX50 crossover at an existing Nissan plant in Hubei province later this year, while Honda aims to build Acura in China from 2016.Infiniti’s President Johan de Nysschen said that production in China may initially turn out to be more expensive than making vehicles in Japan because there could be less economy of scale.But overall product pricing would become more competitive without tariffs and locally made parts tended to cost less, he said.“You cannot compete against your localised competition with an imported car,�� he told Reuters.China’s premium car demand is likely to reach 2.7 million cars a year by 2020, which would make China the world’s biggest premium car market ahead of the United States.In 2013, Lexus sold around 70,400 vehicles in China, up 16 percent from a year ago, according to data from LMC Automotive. Lexus does not disclose China sales figures.Lexus unveiled its new NX compact crossover SUV at the auto show on Sunday, which competes with Audi’s Q3 and BMW’s X1.

BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp.’s sales in China fell 15.9 percent last month from a year earlier, still dogged by a sales crisis Japanese carmakers are suffering following a territorial row between the two countries.Toyota and its two Chinese partners sold 90,800 vehicles in December, compared with 108,000 cars in December 2011, it said on Monday. In 2012, Toyota sold a total of 840,500 vehicles, down 4.9 percent from 2011.The company had said at the outset of last year it would try to sell one million vehicles in China, but failed to meet the target. It had originally set that target for 2010.The pace of last month’s decline eased more than the Japanese company had expected, a senior company executive told Reuters on Sunday, noting that sales had proved “surprisingly resilient.”Toyota’s December sales fall followed declines of 22 percent in November, 44 percent in October and almost 50 percent in September.The executive attributed the recovery in part to discounts and other sales incentives the company offered during the month, as well as what he said was receding fear among Chinese consumers over owning Japanese cars.The executive declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to media.Some Chinese consumers have avoided Japanese cars since violent anti-Japan protests last September after Japan nationalised two East China Sea islands. China claims the islands as its own territory.	7.610174814
(Adds DesRosiers comment, overall sales data, Toyota numbers)TORONTO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - A healthy appetite for light trucks pushed auto sales in Canada to a monthly record in August, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles nudging out Ford Motor Co as the top seller, according to data released on Thursday.Fiat Chrysler Canadian sales edged up 0.4 percent to take the No.1 spot by 349 units, while Ford’s sales fell 5 percent. General Motors Co’s sales, meanwhile, jumped a healthy 12 percent.Overall sales nudged 2.2 percent higher to 175,512 cars and light trucks, making it the strongest August on record. Year-to-date sales were up 2.3 percent at 1,285,959 vehicles.The mixed performance came as new data showed the Canadian economy shrank in the second quarter, putting the country in recession as a plunge in oil prices cut investment. But growth picked up in June, underscoring expectations the recession will be short-lived.“Despite warnings and indeed some recent news stating that the Canadian economy may cool, the appetite for new light vehicles continued to set records in August,�� DesRosiers Automotive Consultants wrote in a note to clients.Light truck sales were up 10 percent, accounting for 60.9 percent of the market in August, with passenger cars making up the remaining 39.1 percent.GM sold 24,653 cars and trucks in Canada, up from 22,111 a year earlier, as truck sales jumped 14.6 percent, and car sales rose 3.2 percent.Ford’s Canadian sales fell to 26,581 vehicles, down from 27,969 a year earlier, hurt by declines in both car and truck sales.Fiat Chrysler sold 26,928 cars and trucks in August, up from 26,825 a year earlier. Jeep sales rose 9.2 percent, while Dodge brand truck sales were up 10.1 percent, but Fiat Chrysler’s total car sales dropped 19 percent to 2,036 vehicles.U.S. auto sales were stronger than expected in August, boosted by pickup truck and SUV sales. Analysts had expected sales to decline.Toyota Canada, a division of Toyota Motor Corp, said sales were down 1.1 percent at 18,292 vehicles, with lower Toyota and Scion sales outweighing record Lexus sales.Honda Canada, part of Honda Motor Co Ltd, reported an 11 percent increase in sales, to 17,277 vehicles, helped in part by its CR-V crossover utility vehicle.

TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Renesas Electronics Corp, the world’s No.1 maker of micro-controller chips used in cars, said Thursday it would appoint Hisao Sakuta from Omron Corp to be its new CEO and chairman.Japanese chipmaker Renesas received a $1.8 billion government-led bailout last year as it attempts to turn around its loss-making system chip division to focus on its core micro-controller business that supplies major automakers like Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co.On Thursday, Renesas posted an operating loss of 23.2 billion yen ($234 million)in the year ended March 31, compared to the 56.8 billion yen loss logged in the previous year.($1 = 98.8200 Japanese yen)	2.547824615
MUMBAI, April 19 (Reuters) - India’s Karnataka state government has ordered Toyota Motor Corp and its union to restore normal operations at its local factories immediately after a month-long standoff between the Japanese auto maker and its workers, the company said.The move comes after many unionised workers at Toyota’s two Indian plants near the southern city of Bangalore refused to return to work despite the ending of a lockout last month over a pay dispute.Neither Toyota nor union officials at the Karnataka plants were reachable for comment over how they would respond to the order.“The government of Karnataka, in order to maintain industrial peace and harmony, has issued an order asking the company and the union to restore normalcy in operations immediately,�� a Toyota statement said on Saturday.“All relevant issues between the workers and the management have been referred for adjudication,�� it said.It gave no further details.The Indian unit of the Japanese auto maker, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Private Ltd (TKM), had lifted the lockout but required its workers to sign a good conduct agreement before returning to work. Workers have refused to sign the undertaking, according to the union president.The company had started limited operations with the help of non-unionised workers and supervisors. It also has said some union members had returned to work. (Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan)	-0.8928571429
DETROIT (Reuters) - A flurry of deals between big automakers and ride hailing and transportation startups is rewriting the playbook in the contest to control the future of personal transportation.Automakers now recognize they may turn ride-hailing services and car sharing companies into steady customers for all sorts of vehicles, particularly hybrid and electric cars, industry executives and analysts say.Tie-ups with carpooling services or short-term rental companies help automakers expose consumers to brands they might otherwise ignore. Technology companies offer access to troves of consumer data, and sophisticated ways to analyze them.From the automakers, the Silicon Valley mobility companies obtain fresh capital, access to auto industry engineers who know how cars work and discounts on vehicles for their drivers.In the latest tie-up between an automaker and a transportation technology startup, German luxury car maker BMW AG said on Wednesday its BMW iVentures venture capital arm has invested an undisclosed amount in California-based Scoop Technologies, which offers a smartphone-powered carpooling service called Scoop.On Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp, the world's No. 1 automaker by vehicle sales, said it was investing an undisclosed amount of money in Uber. Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said on the same day it would invest $300 million in Gett, a smaller ride-hailing company.Earlier this year, General Motors Co acquired a stake in Uber rival Lyft, and the Detroit automaker is launching its own car-sharing and mobility ventures under the Maven brand. Ford Motor Co, Daimler AG and other major automakers have unveiled efforts to embrace ride-hailing and car-sharing services.Automakers “want to make sure they are in the game,�� as more consumers use ride sharing or carpooling, said Mark Short, an Ernst and Young partner who advises automakers on transactions. “To be in the game, you have to make investments in these companies.”In the case of Uber and Toyota, both could benefit from an alliance.Uber “actually knows very little from its own experience about cars - how they’re made, how they work,�� said Jan Dawson, technology analyst with Jackdaw Research. Uber has said it wants to develop self-driving cars - as does Toyota - and the two indicated they will collaborate on research.Toyota said it expects to offer new ways for Uber drivers to buy Toyota cars, and could market Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles to Uber in bulk fleet sales. Details of these programs have yet to be decided, a Toyota spokesman said on Wednesday.Toyota and some rival automakers currently offer discounts to drivers for Uber and its ride-hailing rival, Lyft. An Uber driver who wants to buy a Toyota Prius, for example, could receive a $750 discount. The Uber discount for a Ford Focus is $2,100, according to information on Uber’s website.Uber said on Wednesday discounts from various automakers have saved its drivers more than $20 million on vehicle purchases globally as of the end of last year. As of last December, more than 50,000 people around the world had used its car discount program, Uber Vehicle Solutions, to buy or lease vehicles worth over $1 billion.Ride hailing and car sharing companies could become outlets for automakers trying to sell more electric vehicles, or hybrid cars, to earn credits under U.S. federal and state environmental rules. The high costs of an electric car battery are more rapidly offset by ferrying passengers around a city all day than by a routine round-trip commute.GM executives say Lyft will be an important customer for the automaker’s Chevrolet Bolt electric car, due to launch late this year.BMW’s investment in Scoop is also aimed at selling vehicles, Ulrich Quay, managing director of BMW iVentures, said on Wednesday. Ride sharing can help the automaker get to know customers who have never driven a BMW, he said.The Scoop application connects people who live in the same neighborhoods and work near each other to arrange carpools. The company currently operates in the San Francisco Bay area.	-1.965385744

TOKYO, March 5 (Reuters) - At least 11 Japanese companies, including JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy and Toyota Motor Corp, set up a joint venture to accelerate the construction of fuel stations for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) in the country.The venture, called Japan H2 Mobility, LLC was established on Feb. 20, aims to build 80 hydrogen stations in the first four years. They plan to expand further in six years in line with the government’s goal to increase usage of hydrogen, the companies said.Japan is betting heavily on becoming a “hydrogen society�� despite the high costs and technical difficulties. The government has set a goal to have 160 commercial hydrogen stations and increase the number of FCVs to 40,000 by March 2021.Japan has about 90 stations, of which at least 40 are operated by JXTG Nippon Oil.Other companies involved in the venture include Nissan Motor , Honda Motor, Idemitsu Kosan, Iwatani Corp, Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas, Air Liquide Japan Ltd, Toyota Tsusho and Development Bank of Japan.

SAKARYA, Turkey, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp launched production in Turkey on Wednesday of its C-HR compact SUV crossover and said the model would be exported to all global markets including North America.In a statement, Toyota said production was beginning with an initial investment in Turkey of 350 million euros ($390 mln).	9.92242468
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s cabinet has approved a scheme to spend $1.4 billion to subsidize sales of electric and hybrid vehicles as part of efforts to curb pollution and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.Reuters reported earlier on Thursday that the government could approve the scheme, known as Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME), as early as this week.Under the scheme, subsidies would be offered based on the battery capacity of the vehicle, ranging from buses and cars to three-wheelers and motorbikes, a government statement said. The incentives would be applicable only on vehicles costing less than 1.5 million Indian rupees ($21,177).The benefits of the incentives will be extended to only those vehicles fitted with advanced batteries using lithium ion or other new technologies, the government said.India, one of the world’s fastest-growing car markets, still has negligible sales of electric vehicles (EVs).The government had set a target in 2017 for all new vehicles to be electric by 2030, but critics said the high cost of batteries and a lack of charging points were major obstacles. Carmakers also said the target was too ambitious.The transport ministry later scaled back that target to EVs making up 15 percent of vehicle sales in five years.India will spend 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) over three years on incentives, the government said.A source had earlier told Reuters that subsidies would amount to 10,000 rupees for each kilowatt hour (kWh) of battery capacity in a vehicle, amounting to about 50 percent of the battery cost.The average price of an electric car in India is now about 1 million rupees. Cars typically have a battery up to 20 kWh, so the discount under the new scheme would be 200,000 rupees.Automakers Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Tata Motors both produce electric cars in India. Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor Co build hybrid cars.Maruti, controlled by Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp, last year said it would start testing 50 electric vehicle prototypes. It plans to launch EVs in India around 2020, in cooperation with Toyota.($1 = 70.8300 Indian rupees)	-0.3822502908
TOKYO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is seeking a price reduction of about 5,000 yen ($65) per tonne from Nippon Steel Corp and other steelmakers for the second half of the business year ending in March, in line with a fall in materials prices, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.Steelmakers succeeded in hiking prices for steel sheet in the last round of negotiations, citing higher materials prices, but are resisting significant cuts this time due to depressed earnings on the back of tougher competition against Asian rivals.	13.2468668
LOUDON, N.H. - Early bird Kurt Busch ran his best lap of the day in the final round of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series knockout qualifying at New Hampshire Motor Speedway to earn the top starting spot for Sunday’s Foxwoods 301 (2 p.m. ET on NBCSN, PRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).The first driver on the track for decisive Round 3, Busch covered the one-mile distance in 28.511 seconds (133.591 mph) to edge reigning series champion Martin Turex Jr. by .019 seconds. Truex will start from the front row for the seventh time this season.“I don’t want to second-guess anything, so when the crew chief (Billy Scott) says ‘Go,�� you just go,�� said Busch, who won his first Busch Pole Award in 35 races at the Magic Mile, his third of the season and the 25th of his career. “I like the way we made the right changes through each of the rounds, and we stuck to a game plan.“That’s exactly what you hope to have each time you go to qualifying, where you don’t have to deviate away from the plan you set in place.”In fact, the three rounds of qualifying for Busch followed a script that had written before the first round began.“We discussed it, and the call was made back at the hauler before the qualifying session started,�� Busch said. “it was almost like a non-discussion. It was ‘This is what’s going to happen in Round 1, this is what’s going to happen in Round 2, and here’s what’s going to happen in Round 3��-and we stuck to our plan.”Truex felt he lost what could have been a pole-winning run in the first corner.“I just missed Turn 1 just slightly there in that last run on the first lap, but overall lit was a solid day,�� Truex said. “We had a decent practice - a short practice, you know, because we waited a little bit for the VHT (traction compound) to kind of get run in, and we went out there and ran and were probably a little bit off further on balance more than we needed to be at the end of practice.“So made some changes for qualifying, and the guys did a good job of getting it right and we were close. So couple thousandths, a few inches here or there in a different spot on the race track and might have been able to make it up, but a solid effort for us, and we can go get them on Sunday from second.”Led by his brother, Kyle Busch, Toyota drivers occupied the top five positions in Round 2, but Kurt Busch broke the monopoly in the round that counted in his No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford. Kyle Busch ended up third, followed by Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Denny Hamlin, as Camry drivers claimed positions two through four on the grid.Hendrick Motorsports driver Alex Bowman earned the eighth starting position in the fastest Chevrolet.“To come here and qualify a solid top 10 means the car is probably a whole lot better than that, which is a good thing for me come Sunday,�� said Bowman, who entered this race weekend with an average starting position at Loudon of 30.8 and previous best qualifying effort of 18th.With Erik Jones earning the seventh position and Daniel Suarez qualifying ninth, JGR drivers placed all four cars in the top 10. Surprisingly, Busch was the only Stewart Haas driver to make the cut for the 12-driver final round.The Team Penske Fords of Ryan Blaney and Brad Keselowski will start fifth and sixth, respectively, on Sunday.Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Qualifying - Foxwoods Resort Casino 301New Hampshire Motor Speedway1.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors are trying to determine whether Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp misled U.S. regulators about the number of defective air bags it sold to automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Word of the investigation follows a notice on Tuesday from the U.S. auto regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which increased the number of cars potentially affected by defective air bags made by Takata to at least 7.8 million, up from the roughly 4.74 million they announced a day earlier.The NHTSA has its own investigation underway. It is trying to determine whether Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force potentially could spray metal shrapnel at occupants. They have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.The probe has focused on inflators recovered from cars being recalled for repairs in hot and humid regions such as Florida. Takata is cooperating with that investigation along with 10 automakers.The NHTSA has urged owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda Motor Corp, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Subaru Co Ltd, Chrysler, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co vehicles to replace air bags as soon as possible.More than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled since 2008 because of defective Takata air bags.Reuters previously reported that manufacturing problems with Takata’s air bags go beyond what the Tokyo-based company disclosed to the NHTSA about why the devices were at risk of exploding with dangerous force, citing internal company documentsAccording to Wednesday’s report, the investigation by federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is in its very early stages. The company has not been accused of any wrongdoing. A spokeswoman from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.Spokespeople for Takata, Honda and Ford could not immediately be reached for comment.A BMW spokesman declined to comment on the possibility, adding that the German automaker is focused on carrying out the recall as fast as possible.Spokespeople for Toyota and Chrysler said they had no information on a possible federal investigation of Takata.Spokesmen for Mazda and Mitsubishi said their companies had not been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice and could not confirm the report.A Nissan spokesman said the automaker had no knowledge of such an investigation and declined further comment.Spokespeople from Subaru and GM declined to comment.	7.098139494
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Two Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T brands again led the annual reliability survey from Consumer Reports magazine, and General Motors Co's GM.N Buick was the first American brand in at least 35 years to crack the top three, the consumer magazine said on Monday.It was the fourth straight year that Lexus and Toyota finished in the two top spots, and they have had an outstanding performance since Consumer Reports began tracking brand reliability in the early 1980s.Buick, a “near-luxury�� brand, does well in the survey because it has few models and none of the pickup trucks or truck-based SUVs that hurt the ratings of GM stablemates Chevrolet and Cadillac, said Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports.Asian carmakers still dominate for reliability, with seven of eight brands deemed ""more reliable"" based in Japan or South Korea. Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE luxury Audi brand was the only German manufacturer among the eight ""more reliable"" brands.In the past decade, all brands in Consumer Reports and other third-party surveys have had improvements in reliability, especially the major U.S. automakers GM, Ford Motor Co F.N and Chrysler, now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MIFCAU.N.Fiat Chrysler still lags far behind. Its brands took the bottom four spots in the 29-brand survey. Its most successful brand in terms of sales and reliability is its Jeep SUV lineup, which gained four slots to No. 23.Nissan Motor Co Ltd's 7201.T luxury brand Infiniti was most improved from last year, gaining 16 places in the survey.Favorable results do not always mean better sales. Still, many U.S. consumers use the ratings as a key factor in purchasing decisions. The top-selling models from each for the three major U.S. brands are pickup trucks, which fare poorly in reliability studies.Fisher said large pickup trucks�� drive systems are more complex and raise consumer concerns, and “these trucks are now sold with much more power equipment and in-car electronics, so there are many more things to go wrong.�� Toyota’s Tundra was rated the top full-size pickup truck by a large margin.The fourth U.S. automaker, Tesla Motors Inc TSLA.O, the electric car maker, finished at No. 25. Consumer Reports recommended the Tesla Model S but the ""Model X SUV has been plagued with malfunctions, including its complex Falcon-wing doors.""Among the hot-selling SUV market, the consumer advocacy magazine named best in category, small to large, as the Chevrolet Trax, Toyota RAV4, Toyota 4Runner and Ford Expedition."	2.212581345
(Adds sales data from Ford in paragraphs 10, 11 and GM in paragraph 13)TORONTO, April 1 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales inched just 0.2 percent higher in March from a year earlier, figures on Tuesday showed, but an independent auto industry analyst said the modest increase masked a solid performance during severe winter weather, especially in comparison with the record sales of March 2013.Canadian sales rose to 157,060 vehicles in March from 156,680 the year before, marking the second-best March on record, said Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.“Being up by a sliver isn’t shooting the lights out, but when put in the context of a never-ending winter and strong year-ago sales, then current sales levels should be applauded rather than scorned,�� he wrote in a report.Truck sales climbed 5.1 percent to 90,851 vehicles from 86,475 last year, while car sales went in the opposite direction, falling 5.7 percent to 66,209 vehicles, the DesRosiers report said.“Perhaps the biggest ongoing dynamic is the strength in the light truck market,�� he wrote. That trend is also evident in year-to-date figures, with truck sales up 6.3 percent and auto sales down 6.2 percent.Demand for Detroit 3 branded vehicles slipped 1.1 percent in March to 68,661 vehicles, the report said, while sales of other makers were 1.3 percent higher at 88,399 vehicles.Chrysler Canada, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , took the top sales spot, as strong demand for its trucks offset a slump in car sales.Car sales tumbled by 33.5 percent to 3,469 from 5,217, the company said. Truck sales climbed by 11.7 percent to 21,180 from 18,956. Chrysler Canada’s total sales for the month rose 2 percent to 24,649 from 24,173 in the same period last year.Year to date, Chrysler’s total sales were up 4.9 percent at 60,869 vehicles, with truck sales 10.8 percent higher and car sales down 21.4 percent. The company said the results marked its best first quarter and March sales since 2000.Total March sales at Ford Motor Co of Canada fell 10.7 percent to 22,402 vehicles from 25,092, the company said. Car sales dropped nearly 21 percent to 4,781 vehicles, as truck sales declined 7.5 percent to 17,621 vehicles.So far this year, total Canadian sales are down 7.7 percent to 53,169 vehicles, Ford said.General Motors Canada said that March sales grew by 7.8 percent jump to 21,790 vehicles, from 20,218 in the same period last year.“Retail sales for Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac increased by 12 percent, 25 percent, 10 percent and 17 percent, respectively,�� said John Roth, GM Canada vice president of sales, service and marketing.Toyota Canada Inc said its March sales rose 6.8 percent to 17,397 cars and trucks, lifting first quarter sales 6.2 percent above the same period last year.The results included March records for the 2014 Toyota Highlander and Toyota Tundra, the company said.Sales of Toyota-branded vehicles rose 5.9 percent in March, to 15,509, while Lexus brand sales soared 30.5 percent to a record 1,594. The company said it sold 294 Scion vehicles.Workers at Toyota Canada are expected to vote next week on whether to join Canada’s largest private-sector union, Unifor. The results will not be known until later in April.Honda Canada Inc reported a 6 percent rise in March sales to 15,292 vehicles. Sales of Honda brands rose 5.4 percent to 13,454 and Acura brand sales climbed 6.4 percent to 1,838.Year-to-date sales in the Honda division were up 8.7 percent to 28,099 vehicles, the company said, while sales in the Acura unit were 0.9 percent higher at 3,721 vehicles.In the United States, auto sales inched up more than expected in March after two months in which weather reduced demand, and at least two auto industry executives said a more robust sales rebound could come in April.Ford reported a 3 percent rise in U.S. sales; Toyota a 5 percent gain, and Chrysler Group, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Six-times rally world champion Sebastien Ogier will race for Toyota next season in an all-new driver lineup after the departure of 2019 title winner Ott Tanak.The 35-year-old Frenchman, who competed with Citroen this season, will join Welsh driver Elfyn Evans and 19-year-old Finnish rookie Kalle Rovanpera at the team based in Cologne, Germany.Ogier won six titles in succession before Estonian Tanak, who has moved to new champions Hyundai, secured this year’s title.“We know how strong Sebastien is and we’re all looking forward to working with him and (co-driver) Julien (Ingrassia),�� said team boss Tommi Makinen, a retired four-times world champion.“I think that being able to attract a driver with his record says a lot about what we have achieved in such a short space of time with this team.”Ogier had discussed joining Toyota at the end of 2016, when he ended up leaving Volkswagen for M-Sport Ford, and said he felt ‘overwhelmed�� at the prospect of working with boyhood idol Makinen.The one-year deal could be his last, having spoken previously of retirement after 2020.Evans joins from M-Sport Ford, who had hoped to retain his services.Apart from Tanak, Finnish driver Jari-Matti Latvala and 40-year-old Northern Irishman Kris Meeke will also be departing Toyota.M-Sport are the only team with a vacant seat after Citroen announced last week they were leaving the championship, and they have plenty of choice.	0.2852863562
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Toyota Tsusho Corp, the Japanese trading company, will buy a stake in Encana Corp’s massive coalbed methane field in southern Alberta for C$602 million ($608 million).The deal, announced on Friday, is the latest installment in Canadian gas producer’s drive to get third parties to inject cash into its operations as prices for natural gas hit decade lows.Encana said Toyota Tsusho, one of the Toyota Motor Corp group of companies, paid C$100 million up front and will invest about C$502 million over seven years to buy a 32.5 percent royalty interest in the Horseshoe Canyon formation, where production is currently around 120 million cubic feet a day.It is the second such deal between a Japanese company and Canada’s largest gas producer in slightly more than two months. In February, Encana agreed to sell a 40 percent interest in British Columbia gas assets to Mitsubishi Corp for C$2.9 billion as a way to accelerate development, while protecting a balance sheet under pressure from low gas prices.Encana is hunting for partners to help fund development of a host of other assets as well, including up to five in the United States and Canada with potential for higher-value liquids-rich gas. Such deals could mean around US$2 billion in combined cash proceeds and carried development spending for the Calgary-based company, analysts have said.Under Friday’s deal, Toyota Tsusho will get an interest in 4,000 wells and 1,500 drilling locations on 480,000 net acres, which represent about a quarter of Encana’s coalbed methane acreage.Being a dry gas play, Encana had not devoted a large part of its 2012 capital spending to Horseshoe Canyon, spokeswoman Carol Howes said. Early this year the company stopped spending and even shut off some production in response to depressed prices.“These funds really allow us to maintain the ongoing program,�� Howes said.They are fee lands, meaning that Encana does not pay royalties to the provincial government on production.The region contains 480 billion cubic feet equivalent of proved plus probable gas reserves, Encana said.Toyota Tsusho said part of the attraction is that the Horseshoe Canyon wells do not produce water with the methane, reducing environmental concerns as well as extra processing costs.For Encana, the transaction is positive, but it will not have a major impact on its overall finances, CIBC World Markets analyst Andrew Potter said. He said in a research note that the price reflects a stronger natural gas price than today’s, especially since the production does not have medium-term liquefied natural gas potential such as assets in British Columbia.Encana shares were off 1 Canadian cent at C$17.99 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midday on Friday. They have lost about 14 percent of their value in the past month.($1=$0.99 Canadian)	-3.436988543
* European car sales record further gain in October* Toyota, Renault lead advance among mass automakers* Daimler gains ground against BMW, AudiPARIS/MILAN, Nov 19 (Reuters) - European car sales rose 4.6 percent in October, according to industry data published on Tuesday, as a broad-based recovery took root in the region’s main auto markets.Toyota and Renault led the advance among mass manufacturers, with Daimler gaining ground on premium rivals as total registrations rose to 1.04 million cars, the Association of European Automakers said.Despite what may become a sustained upturn in demand, the European auto market is set to post a sixth consecutive full-year decline in 2013 to its lowest level in two decades. Registrations were down 3.1 percent for January-October across the European Union and EFTA trading bloc.But the year-on-year advance in October - a month after sales turned positive with a 5.5 percent increase - may embolden car executives planning for a return to full-year growth in 2014, albeit a low single-digit rate.“The market could pick up more quickly than we had anticipated,�� said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for LMC Automotive.Ford, PSA Peugeot Citroen and General Motors have all reacted to the slump by closing plants.But with factories still running at an average 65 percent of maximum output, Poskitt cautioned, “overcapacity remains an issue��.Carmakers that have kept up investment to launch successful new models in recent months are already gaining market share in the beginnings of a recovery.Renault’s group sales jumped 14 percent on strong demand for its Captur mini-SUV and revamps of the no-frills Dacia brand’s Logan and Sandero models.Toyota surged 16.5 percent to 49,097 cars last month, helped by models like the Auris compact.European market leader Volkswagen and General Motors also outpaced the broader expansion with respective gains of 5.7 percent and 6.2 percent.Within the VW group total, sales at the premium Audi division shrank 0.5 percent, while rival BMW rose just 0.3 percent. Both trailed an 8.5 percent gain for Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz division on the popularity of new models like the CLA compact.October’s registrations increase was helped by positive contributions in all major European markets - including a 34 percent surge in Spain - with the exception of Italy.“Spain’s increase is very positive,�� said Peter Fuss, a senior automotive specialist with Ernst &amp; Young. “It’s a sign that confidence in the euro zone is coming back.”The Italian market’s further 5.6 percent decline compounded the punishment for Fiat, which has slashed investment to ride out the crisis and pursue a buyout of 58.5 percent-owned Chrysler.The group’s ageing model lineup suffered a 7.3 percent drop in European sales, led by declines of 12.2 percent at Lancia and 34 percent at the Alfa Romeo brand, still awaiting a long-promised revival plan.While IHS Automotive forecasters expect a return to low Italian growth next year, Fiat-Chrysler’s regional boss Alfredo Altavilla said this month he saw no recovery signs yet.Despite a 2.6 percent French market expansion and new model launches, Peugeot posted a further 0.7 percent regional sales decline - a worrying sign for the Paris-based carmaker as it struggles to halt losses threatening its independent survival.That eroded the Peugeot and Citroen brands�� combined European market share to 11 percent for the first 10 months of 2013 from 11.8 percent a year earlier.	-5.791352638
FRANKFURT, June 3 (Reuters) - Kion Group, the world’s second-biggest maker of forklift trucks behind Toyota Industries Corp, said it was preparing an initial public offering (IPO) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.It said on Monday that its main shareholders, funds advised or controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs, would remain invested.Strategic anchor investor Weichai Power will increase its stake in Kion to 30 percent ahead of the offering, it said.	5.927617115
TOKYO (Reuters) - Two top Japanese automakers said they planned to tighten their belts in the years ahead to free up cash to develop electric cars and ride-sharing services, underscoring the hard task ahead as traditional automakers face a rapidly changing industry.Toyota Motor Corp, the country’s top automaker, said that higher costs to develop new technologies like connected cars was ramping up pressure to generate savings wherever possible, while Honda Motor Co said it would strip down its vehicle lineup to cut production costs.“We still weren’t able to improve our costs enough last year,�� Toyota CFO Koji Kobayashi told reporters, adding that mounting investment required for new technologies and other R&amp;D costs was making cost-cutting efforts more challenging.“We need to work to find new ways to reduce costs this year,�� he said, adding that penny pinching would apply to all aspects of the business, from producing lower-cost prototypes to limiting the number of pencils employees use at any given time.Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo said Japan’s No. 3 automaker would cut the number of car model variations to a third of current offerings by 2025, reducing global production costs by 10 percent and redirecting those savings toward advanced research and development.“We recognize that the number of models and variations at the trim and option level have increased and our efficiency has declined,�� he told reporters at a briefing.Toyota expects cost reduction efforts will help to lift operating profit by 3.3 percent to 2.55 trillion yen ($23.20 billion) in the year to March 2020. In the year just ended, Toyota posted an operating profit of 2.47 trillion yen.The profit outlook for one of the world’s biggest car makers was slightly lower than the 2.61 trillion yen average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Toyota also announced a 300 billion yen share buyback.(For an interactive chart on Toyota's financial year, click on tmsnrt.rs/2Xzf8Xl​�����������)Honda forecast cost reductions would help boost operating profit by 6 percent to 770 billion yen in the year to March. That is less than the 834 billion yen average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.Profit fell 13 percent to 726 billion yen in the year ended March due to currency fluctuations and costs related to Honda’s plan to shutter production plants in the UK and Turkey in 2021.(For interactive charts on Honda's financial year, click on tmsnrt.rs/2Ix5Zep)Toyota expects to sell a record 10.74 million vehicles globally in the current year, up 1.3 percent on the year and lifted by higher sales in Asia as it continues to grow sales in China despite an overall slowdown in the world’s biggest auto market.But sales in North America are expected to struggle for another year due to weak U.S. demand for its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and the Camry as drivers continue to shift to larger, higher-margin trucks and SUVs. Toyota expects sales in the region to slide 1.6 percent.Kobayashi said Toyota wanted to raise its operating margin in North America to 8 percent in 2020, in line with the global margin, from around 1 percent, but acknowledged it was not confident of meeting the target.To do so, the automaker would need to further ramp up its sales ratio of SUVs and trucks from around 60 percent of total vehicle sales in 2018 and slash discounting, he said.Toyota, Honda and their rivals are facing stiff competition as ride-sharing technology and the race to develop self-driving cars has caused rapid - and costly - disruption to the auto industry.These new technologies have opened the industry to tech firms and other players, forcing traditional automakers to rethink their strategy of selling gasoline-powered passenger cars to individual drivers, a business model which has been essentially unchallenged for the past century.“From here on will be an age in which the difference between victory and defeat will be decided by the last one mile, which will be our contact point with customers,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters.“Merely depending on the business model of the past will not lead to the future.��	0.5174113009
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp raised its full-year profit forecast by more than a third as it cuts costs, trims spending and expects Japanese government schemes to boost sales, though the guidance was still some way below analysts�� expectations.Japan’s No.1 automaker now expects operating profit - earnings from its core operations - for the year to end-March of 270 billion yen ($3.5 billion), a drop of 42 percent from last year, and lagging a consensus forecast of 331 billion yen from 23 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Toshiyuki Kanayama, senior market analyst at Monex Securities, said the revised profit guidance was a bit of a disappointment. “But the market is looking at the next financial year. The key for Toyota shares will be whether profit (next year) will rise to around 800 billion yen.”Toyota, which has a market value of $135 billion -- more than rivals Honda Motor Co Ltd, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp combined -- raised its annual forecast for net profit, which includes earnings made in China, by 11 percent to 200 billion yen.October-December operating profit jumped 51 percent to 149.7 billion yen ($1.95 billion) from a year earlier, well ahead of the average estimate of a small decline to 93.9 billion yen.Those results defied the impact of a stronger yen and the disruption to production and supply chains from widespread flooding in Thailand late last year that battered Toyota just as it was recovering from the March earthquake in Japan.Toyota reckons the Thai floods will cost it 240,000 vehicles in lost production worldwide, allowing General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG to overtake it in 2011 vehicle sales.Quarterly net profit slid 13.5 percent to 80.9 billion yen.With the two natural disasters mostly behind it, Toyota expects its sales to jump by more than a fifth this year to a record 9.58 million vehicles, including subsidiaries Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd. All its car factories, bar Thailand, are back at full speed.“It’s premature to talk about any (sales) trends by looking only at our performance from last year when we had all those natural disasters,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters last week. “I would want Toyota to be measured on how we do this year, provided it’s a peaceful one.”Senior Managing Officer Takahiko Ijichi said Toyota aimed to increase sales in China, the world’s biggest market, by around 14 percent to more than 1 million vehicles this year. He expects competition, particularly in North America, to be tough.“The Big Three have improved their financial standing quite a bit, partly thanks to support from the government. Their cars are also getting better, and in that sense the competitive landscape has gotten a lot tougher,�� Ijichi said, referring to Ford Motor Co, General Motors and Chrysler Group LLC.“Korean brands are also pushing hard, so, for Toyota and Japanese brands, it’s a very tough race.”Still, Ijichi said Toyota’s 19 new or refreshed models due in the United States this year should help it recover lost ground after a difficult 2011.With the dollar trading at 76-77 yen, Toyota’s Achilles�� heel remains its heavy exposure to Japan.Toyota last year built 2.76 million cars at home, accounting for one-third of Japan’s total vehicle production. It exported 57 percent of that, much of it at a loss. A plan to return its Japan-based parent operations to break-even assumes a dollar rate of 85 yen.“Compared with Honda and Nissan, the pace of Toyota’s profit recovery is very slow,�� said Koji Endo, analyst at Advanced Research Japan. “The issue of high fundamental costs appears not to have improved at all.”Last week, Honda reported weak profits hit hard by the twin natural disasters, but flagged a big leap next year. Nissan, Japan’s No.2 automaker, reports on Wednesday.Toyota is scrambling to make its domestic factories more efficient to keep its promise of building at least 3 million vehicles a year at home.Ijichi said the company was also looking to import more components for Japan-made cars, setting up a special task force to speed up those efforts. Toyota now sources “a few percent�� of its parts from abroad, he said.For now, Toyota is counting on Japan’s re-instatement of cash-for-clunkers subsidies and the extension of tax incentives to ease some of the pain at home. The incentives particularly benefit hybrids and other cars that use new technologies. Its newest Aqua hybrid received orders equivalent to 10 times the sales target in its first month.Toyota shares have risen 28 percent since the market’s trough in late-November, and Monday touched a 6-month high. Tokyo’s main Topix index is up 10 percent over the same period, while Nissan has gained 16 percent and Honda 29 percent.Ahead of the results Tuesday, Toyota shares closed flat at 2,986 yen, and the Topix gained 0.4 percent.($1 = 76.5850 Japanese yen)	3.655319683
* Won’t follow Tata, Datsun into low-priced cars-Toyoda* Need certain level of profits to grow sustainably* Toyota to target mid- to upper-class in emerging markets* Not interested in global sales crown for volume’s sakeBy Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor has no intention of offering ultra-cheap cars to boost sales in emerging markets and will keep its focus on customers who expect a certain level of reliability, the company’s president, Akio Toyoda, said on Thursday.Toyoda’s comments come days after rival Nissan Motor announced the revival of the Datsun brand to target buyers in the lowest and sizeable end of developing markets, while a German magazine reported Volkswagen was also planning a similar move.“We are a full-line car maker,�� Toyoda told a small group of reporters in Tokyo.“But to grow sustainably, we need to make a certain level of profit on cars, no matter how big or small they are. Does Toyota have the ability to make cars for 500,000 yen ($6,000) like Tata Motors? I don’t think so,�� he said, referring to the Indian automaker famed for developing the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, whose sales have fallen short of targets.“When we think about what customers value in our cars, it’s reliability,�� Toyoda said, adding that was evident in the popularity of used Toyota cars in many Asian countries.“We won’t risk sacrificing quality simply to meet a certain price range.”As demand becomes saturated in the developed world, global automakers are eyeing low-cost cars to drive sales growth, especially among first-time buyers moving up from motorcycles and used cars in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China.Toyota has taken small steps to target that base, starting with the made-for-India Etios model. But analysts have said the starting price, of just under 400,000 rupees ($7,800) for the lowest-grade hatchback version, was still too high to challenge cut-price stalwarts such as Maruti Suzuki.BEING “NUMBER ONE”Nissan, meanwhile, is counting on Datsun to tap a price range uncharted by global automakers as it aims to join Toyota, General Motors and Volkswagen at the top of the sales charts with French partner Renault.In contrast, Toyoda said he wanted Toyota to put its energy into developing products for the middle- to upper-class where its strengths lie, even if that meant playing in only a fraction of big, emerging markets.“China has 1.4 billion people, but we don’t have to target all 1.4 billion,�� he said. “We’ll target perhaps 200 or 300 million of that - but that’s about the size of the whole U.S. market. It’s huge.”While GM and Volkswagen fight it out for sales dominance in China and the rest of the world, Toyoda said he wanted Toyota to strive for industry leadership in other ways, much like GM did by developing the industry as the biggest car maker over more than 70 years.“Until we overtook them (in 2008), GM was number one, uninterrupted since the 1930s. During that time, it helped the industry develop and created a culture of cars. That’s the kind of company that deserves to be the industry leader,�� he said.“Going forward, I think there will be a lot of shuffling around among the top five or seven. But for the crown to really mean anything, I don’t want to use it as a motivational tool,�� he said, repeating his warning that unchecked sales growth had played a role in Toyota’s quality crisis a few years ago.Toyota fell to third place in global vehicles sales behind GM and Volkswagen last year, hit by the disruption that followed the earthquake and tsunami disaster.	-5.169531996
SEOUL (Reuters) - Japanese automakers posted sharper sales falls in South Korea in August, industry data showed on Wednesday, hit by a consumer boycott of Japanese vehicles amid a worsening diplomatic row between the countries.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and other Japanese carmakers saw South Korean sales tumble 57% to 1,398 vehicles in August from a year earlier, steeper than the 17% fall in July.Japan’s decision in July to tighten controls on exports of materials that South Korea uses to make semiconductors and display screens has prompted a consumer backlash in Korea, with consumers boycotting Japanese products such as beer, clothes, vehicles and tours to the neighboring country.Relations between the two U.S. allies had already soured over South Korean demands for Japanese compensation for South Korean forced laborers during World War Two.Toyota's South Korean sales fell 59% to 542 in August from a year earlier, while Honda Motor's 7267.T sales tumbled 81% to 138.

* Q3 operating profit seen down 5.3 pct y/y* Consensus sees company guidance as cautious* Yen weighs but new govt incentives to ease some pain* CEO wants Toyota to be measured in “peaceful�� year* Q3 results due at 0600 GMTBy Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s top carmaker, Toyota Motor Corp, is expected to report weaker quarterly earnings on Tuesday, hurt by a stronger yen and recent floods in auto-making hub Thailand, but investors will be hoping for an upgrade to its full-year profit guidance.Thailand’s deadly floods last fall came just as Toyota was ramping up production to recover from losses caused at home by Japan’s earthquake in March 2011. Disruption from the floods cost Toyota 260,000 vehicles of lost output worldwide last year.That knocked Toyota’s sales down 6 percent in 2011, placing it behind General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG in global vehicle sales.The yen’s prolonged strength also continues to weigh on Toyota, which by far has the biggest operations in Japan. Last year, the automaker built 2.76 million cars at home, accounting for a third of Japan’s total vehicle production. It exported 57 percent of that, much of it at a loss.For the October-December third quarter, nine analysts polled by Reuters put Toyota’s operating profit at 93.9 billion yen ($1.23 billion), down 5.3 percent from the year before. Toyota is due to announce its results at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) on Tuesday.Last week, rival Honda Motor Co reported a plunge in profits, hit partly by a 6-yen fall in the dollar for the quarter.With all but Thai production fully recovered, however, investors will focus on whether Toyota revises its operating profit forecast of 200 billion yen for the year to March 31.Consensus forecasts from 23 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S see a much higher 330.8 billion yen, counting on a sales recovery and deeper cost cuts.Toyota has forecast a 21 percent jump in sales this calendar year to 9.58 million vehicles, including subsidiaries Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd, possibly placing it back at the top of the sales ranking.“It’s premature to talk about any (sales) trends by looking only at our performance from last year when we had all those natural disasters,�� Toyota’s president, Akio Toyoda, told reporters last week. “I would want Toyota to be measured on how we do this year, provided it’s a peaceful one.”With the dollar trading around 76-77 yen, Toyota’s Achilles�� heel remains its heavy exposure to Japan.Toyota is scrambling to make its domestic factories more efficient to keep its promise of building at least 3 million vehicles a year at home. A plan to return its Japan-based parent operations to break-even assumes a dollar rate of 85 yen.In the near term, Toyota will benefit from the Japanese government’s recent decision to reinstate cash-for-clunker subsidies and extend tax incentives on purchases of fuel-efficient cars, especially hybrids and other cars that employ new technologies. Its newest hybrid, the Aqua, received orders equivalent to 10 times the sales target in its first month.Toyota’s shares have risen 13 percent in the year to date, faring better than most other Japanese auto stocks and Tokyo’s main Topix index.	3.655319683

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota, Nissan and Mazda welcomed on Tuesday the revised North America trade deal that left Japanese automakers unscathed but they may face a bumpy ride when Washington and Tokyo hold new talks on over $40 billion of annual U.S. auto imports from Japan.The United States and Canada reached an agreement on Sunday to update the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement after Washington had forged a separate trade deal with Mexico in August.The updated deal effectively maintains the auto industry’s current footprint in North America, and spares Canada and Mexico from the prospect of U.S. national security tariffs on their vehicles.Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, which ships cars to the United States from Mexico and Japan, called the deal a ""big step forward"". Nissan Motor Corp 7201.T, which makes the cars it sells in the United States locally as well as in Mexico, Japan and other countries, said it was ""encouraged"" by the agreement.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Japan's biggest automaker, said it was ""pleased"" that a basic deal was reached. Other automakers were not immediately available for comment.While the deal has removed the risk that the disintegration of the pact would have posed to automakers, bigger risks loom large for Japanese firms as a chunk of the roughly 7 million cars they sold in the U.S. last year were shipped from Japan, and a trade deal between Washington and Tokyo has yet to be agreed.The United States and Japan last week agreed to begin fresh trade talks, with U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to address Japan’s $69 billion trade surplus, of which nearly two-thirds comes from auto exports.Washington is also investigating the possibility of slapping 25 percent tariffs on auto imports on national security grounds, although it has agreed with Japan to put any new tariffs on hold during the talks.Analysts say the United States may take a tougher stance on auto imports from Japan than from its neighbors.“If Japan requests an exemption from the 25 percent tariffs under consideration, Washington could propose a more strict cap on imports than it agreed to with Mexico and Canada,�� said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities.“That would be a risk.”This could be a big blow to Japan, as the United States is a key source of revenue for Japanese automakers including Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor Co 7267.T.The U.S. market accounts for a quarter or more of their annual global vehicle sales, and of their total U.S. sales, and depending on the automaker, as much as half of those was shipped from Japan last year.A side letter to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), as the new deal agreed on Sunday is called, states that Mexico and Canada would each get a tariff-free passenger vehicle quota of 2.6 million annual export units, well above their current export levels.“I don’t think that will happen in the case of Japan,�� said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama, adding that U.S. automakers, which sell very few cars in Japan, would stand to lose little from any trade barriers with Japan."	-6.37180813
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers on Wednesday said they would temporarily close more vehicle plants in Europe and Asia as the spread of the coronavirus prompts countries to instruct non-essential businesses to suspend operations.A growing number of global automakers have been shuttering plants in Europe and beyond as the COVID-19 outbreak prompts governments to impose commuting restrictions, leaving companies bracing for supply chain disruptions.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it had stopped operations at plants in Britain and Poland from Wednesday, while its Czech site would be halted on Thursday. Operations at its Turkey site would be suspended from Saturday. Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said it had stopped output at its two plants in Spain and its plant in Britain, while Honda Motor Co 7267.T said it was temporarily closing all its dealerships in Italy, which is experiencing big daily increases in virus infections. Toyota said its plant in the Philippines has stopped operations through mid-April, while its plant in Malaysia will be closed from next Monday through the end of March. Honda had also suspended production in both countries.Earlier on Wednesday, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, which said it would suspend production at its European plants for 10 days, warned that the spreading virus would disrupt its supply chain.Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all said that operations in North America, one of their biggest production bases, remained in operation at the moment even as governments in the United States and Canada have been implementing more movement restrictions to curb an increase in virus infections.	2.943415377
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it will build new factories in Mexico and China, ending a self-imposed expansion freeze and putting more pressure on global rivals.The world’s largest automaker by sales volume said it would build a $1 billion plant with an annual capacity of 200,000 cars in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, increasing its overall North American production capacity by about the same number of vehicles.That plant, Toyota’s first passenger car plant in Mexico, would have about 2,000 workers, the company said.The highly anticipated announcement comes amid a flurry of new auto investments in Mexico, as carmakers are drawn to its low labor costs, free trade agreements and proximity to the United States.Since the beginning of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration in December 2012, auto investments have reached over $20 billion dollars, Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said at Toyota’s announcement in Mexico City on Wednesday.The new Mexico plant will be the first built from the ground up under the Toyota New Global Architecture strategy, the automaker’s new approach to engineering and building vehicles, Jim Lentz, head of Toyota’s North American operations, said in an interview on Wednesday.Toyota said investment for the Guanajuato plant would likely be about 40 percent less than comparable investments in 2008. The Guanajuato site will be a model for other factories globally, Lentz said.Toyota plans to move production of its Corolla compact car to the new Mexican plant in 2019 from a factory in Cambridge, Ontario.The Canadian plant will get a new product, Lentz said, as part of a realignment of Toyota’s North American manufacturing that will concentrate production of low-margin, small cars in Mexico and at a Mississippi factory currently building the Corolla.Toyota plants in Canada and the central United States will focus on larger, expensive cars and sport utilities. Pickup truck production will remain in Texas and Mexico, Lentz said.In China, Toyota said it would spend about 52.5 billion yen ($440 million) to add a new facility and a third line at its factory in Guangzhou, owned jointly with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd. The line could start production in 2017 with capacity to make about 100,000 cars a year.Wednesday’s moves officially end Toyota President Akio Toyoda’s three-year moratorium on capacity expansion, and increase pressure on the automaker’s rivals, including Volkswagen AG and Detroit automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.Toyota’s sales took a hit during the 2007-09 recession and a 2010 recall scandal. Toyota says it is now using about 90 percent of its total manufacturing capacity compared with about 70 percent in 2009.With the new Mexican plant, Lentz said: “We’ve expanded as much as we need to at this point.��($1 = 119.49 yen)	0.3237875953
SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian ride-hailing service Grab said on Monday it had secured an investment from Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co as part of a deal to collaborate on its motorbike-hailing service, in the latest auto industry tie-up of its type.Grab said Honda had agreed to invest an undisclosed amount in the firm, and the two companies would form a partnership to develop the ride-sharing technology and related driver education programmes.Automakers such as Volkswagen, Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors also have tie-ups with ride-sharing firms to hedge against a shift in the vehicle market away from private ownership.Grab, the biggest rival to ride-sharing service Uber Technologies Inc in Southeast Asia, raised $750 million in a funding round in September. A source familiar with the matter said the round valued Grab at more than $3 billion.Earlier this month, Grab, whose services include taxi and motorbike-hailing, car-pooling, delivery and mobile payments, announced that Japanese financial services company Tokyo Century Corp had made a strategic investment in the firm for an undisclosed amount.

(Adds union quote)CAPE TOWN, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Toyota South Africa operations were halted on Monday at its Durban assembly plant and a Johannesburg warehouse because of a strike by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), a company spokesman said.“The strike has resulted in the suspension of operations today,�� Clynton Yon said in a statement.The union said it would continue the strike until its demands are met, adding that the action would spread to other Toyota factories over disputes on issues including staff recruitment, bonuses and transport allowances.“The strike which began today will affect all Toyota plants nationally. Our members are resolute and disciplined. They will not back down until all their demands are met,�� said NUMSA.Labour strife has hobbled the production of cars in Africa’s largest automotive manufacturing sector, where Toyota, Ford , BMW and Chinese carmaker BAIC have invested heavily to boost output.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 24 (Reuters) - A child-abduction alert was issued on Tuesday in St. Louis for a 5-year-old boy who police said was on a waiting list for a heart transplant and is believed to have been taken by his father.Porter Stone was reported missing from Children’s Hospital at 4:20 p.m. local time after his father, with whom he left, called the boy’s mother to tell her “he was taking his son,�� said officer Sherri Bruns of the St. Louis Police Department.The couple reportedly has been embroiled in a custody dispute over the boy, she said.The boy was carrying a backpack with a medical intravenous pump and medication that will last 48 hours, Bruns said. He was at the hospital awaiting a transplant, she said, adding, “He is next on the list.”Porter Stone is described as 3-foot-10-inches tall, weighing 44 lbs ( 20 kg), wearing with a Mohawk-style haircut and dressed in a gray shirt and black-and-white shorts and Spiderman shoes.Police said the father, Jeffrey Stone, 33, may be driving a black or silver Toyota Corolla with California plates.

* Nikkei, Topix hit lowest level since early January* U.S.-China confrontation seen hurting exporters* Transport equipment makers hit 3-year low* Suntory, Subaru shine on strong earningsTOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Japanese shares plummeted on Tuesday to their lowest since early January, spooked by the spectre of a full-blown economic war between the United States and China after Washington designated China a currency manipulator.Although the market pared more than half of its earlier losses, helped in part as the Chinese yuan steadied, sentiment remained cautious on heightening uncertainties over the global economic outlook.The Nikkei share average fell 0.65% to 20,585.31, after diving 2.94% at one point and hitting its lowest since Jan. 10. The broader Topix lost 0.44% to 1,499.23.“Trend-followers are boosting their short positions on the Nikkei futures. The Nikkei could fall another 800 points, with 19,000-19,500 increasingly seen as a target,�� said Masanari Takada, cross asset strategist at Nomura Securities.A yearlong U.S.-China trade war took a sharp turn for the worse as Washington accused Beijing of manipulating its currency after China let the yuan drop to its lowest point in more than a decade.Companies with exposure to global trade were badly hit as the yen has risen, hitting a seven-month high against the dollar and 33-month high on a trade-weighted basis.Toyota Motor and Softbank Group, Japan’s two biggest firms by market cap with global presence, fell 2.4% and 2.9%, respectively.Panasonic slumped 2.0%, having lost as much as 4.2% to hit 3-1/2-year lows while Honda Motor dipped 0.2%, hitting three-year lows.The transport equipment maker index fell 0.8%, shedding as much as 3.3% to hit a three-year low.Sharp falls in the market prompted buybacks in some of the most battered shares.Steelmaker shares, one of the early victims of U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, hit near seven-year lows before bouncing back 1.2% while brokerage shares also rose 1.2%, erasing earlier falls to three-year lows.Suzuki Motor ended up 0.3%, recovering from an earlier fall of more than 10%, after the automaker posted disappointing quarterly earnings results due to a slowdown in India, the most important growth market for the firm. The shares have lost about half of their value from a record peak hit almost a year ago.On the other hand, there were pockets of brightness in some earnings results.Suntory Beverage &amp; Food rose 5.1% after its April-June profits beat market expectations.Subaru spurted 8.1% higher following its brisk earnings results.Trading turnover surged to 2.637 trillion yen, more than 30% above the average over the past month.The Nikkei volatility index rose to 26.41, also the highest since early January, before easing to 22.98.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp are launching a joint venture next year to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries, leveraging the heft of one of the world’s largest automakers and battery makers to expand their EV push.Toyota will own 51 percent of the joint venture, and Panasonic the rest, the two companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday, confirming previous reports.The joint venture, which builds on an initial lithium-ion battery partnership struck between the two companies in late 2017, reflects the aim of the Japanese companies to become a bigger global player in the battery industry, which is vital for the development of affordable EVs.The two companies will pool part of existing battery-related equipment and engineers to the joint venture. Panasonic will also transfer its manufacturing capabilities in Japan and China for its thin, rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries.The two companies will transfer a total of 3,500 employees.Batteries produced by the joint venture will be sold to various automakers.The capital size of the venture has not been decided yet, the two companies said.While Panasonic is one of the world’s biggest EV battery suppliers, it is facing rising competition from South Korean makers Samsung SDI Co and LG Chem, and CATL of China.Panasonic is currently Tesla Inc’s exclusive battery cell supplier, but Reuters reported that the U.S. EV maker has been in discussions with other companies including China’s Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai car factory.Toyota and Panasonic already operate a joint venture called Prime Earth EV Energy, which manufactures batteries mainly used in gasoline hybrid vehicles.The new joint venture also shows that Toyota is expanding further into development and production of EV batteries just as many rivals have been stepping away from their development due to the heavy costs involved.	-0.5307422226
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday it is offering retirement incentives to about 2,000 U.S. workers, or 10 percent of its employees in the country, in an effort to manage attrition of its aging work force.About 1,600 workers at the Japanese automaker’s Georgetown, Kentucky plant, or about a quarter of the work force there, are eligible, Toyota spokesman Mike Goss said.The rest of the eligible employees work at plants and offices throughout the United States, he said.“We’re trying to spread out the impact of the attrition over some time as opposed to the risk of them all walking away at the same time,�� Goss said.Toyota began hiring people in Kentucky 25 years ago and the plant opened in 1988. The factory builds the Camry sedan, Venza crossover vehicle and Avalon large sedan.The automaker employs about 20,000 people in the United States, including about 6,600 at the Georgetown plant that began production in 1988 and has an annual production capacity of 500,000 vehicles. Goss said they expect about 20 percent to 25 percent of those eligible to take the offer.Employees who work 25 years at Toyota qualify for retirement with full medical benefits, pension and 401k pay, he said. The offer is also being made, however, to those who have worked at the company 22 years or more, and includes the ability for employees to purchase the years needed to qualify for full retirement. Goss declined to say what it costs for employees to purchase those years.Under the offer, each worker will get a lump-sum payment equal to two weeks pay for every year of service, up to 25 years, plus eight additional weeks of pay, Goss said. In return, the workers would agree to leave on a schedule set by the company.Toyota's plant employees are not unionized, but receive similar pay and benefits as those represented at General Motors CoGM.N, Ford Motor CoF.N and Chrysler Group LLC by the United Auto Workers. Chrysler is controlled by Italy's FiatFIA.MI.The retirement offer also will allow Toyota to reduce manufacturing labor costs as veteran workers typically earn about $26 an hour, compared with starting pay of around $16 an hour.The retirement incentive offer was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal.	8.860611721
* Trump comments seen as sign Sino-U.S. trade deal elusive* U.S. bill on Uighurs further complicating negotiation* Cyclicals including chip-related shares hit* Small, domestic-oriented shares outperformTOKYO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Japanese shares tumbled on Wednesday as comments from U.S. President Donald Trump and a U.S. House bill targeting camps for Muslims in Xinjiang reignited fears a trade deal between Washington and Beijing may not come through.Renewed concerns about the global economic outlook also prompted investors to shift funds from global cyclicals to domestic-demand oriented shares.The Nikkei 225 index skidded 1.05% to 23,135.23, closing below its 25-day moving average of 23,255, a key technical support, for the first time in almost two months.The broader Topix lost 0.20% to 1,703.27 but , advancing shares outnumbered decliners by a ratio of 57 to 43 in an unusual twist.Trump’s comments that a trade deal with China might have to wait until late 2020 raised fresh doubts on when the dispute might end, while a U.S. House bill targeting camps for Muslims in Xinjiang drew Beijing’s ire.The Uighur bill calls on the U.S. President to, among other things, impose sanctions for the first time on a member of China’s powerful politburo.“I think the Uighur bill is far more significant than Hong Kong bill for China. The U.S-China trade talk is breaking down,�� said Hiroaki Hayashi, managing director at Fukoku Capital.Cyclical shares led the losses, with securities brokerage the worst performing among the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s 33 industry subindexes.Nomura Holdings fell 2.4% while Daiwa Securities Group dropped 1.8%.Semiconductor-related shares that had benefited from hopes of a bottom-out in the sector, were also caught in the downdraft.TDK fell 1.8% while Taiyo Yuden lost 2.1%.Murata Manufacturing stumbled 2.1% while industrial robot manufacturer Fanuc dropped 1.5%.Generally, exporters were also hit from the yen’s gains so far this week. Honda Motor shed 1.1%, though Toyota Motor bucked the trend to rise 0.8%.The yen has strengthened over 1% in the past 48 hours.Fast Retailing dived 4.9% after the operator of the Uniqlo casual clothing chain reported weak domestic sales in November. The drop was enough to chop 110 points, or 0.5 percentage point, off the Nikkei.On the other hand, many defensive shares advanced, including utility companies.Tokyo Electric Power rose 3.2% while Chubu Electric Power gained 1.9% and Osaka Gas 1.8%.Small cap shares were another bright spot, with Topix Small , which excludes top 500 companies, rising 0.40%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T posted a forecast-beating 4.4 percent rise in April-June operating profit and raised its North America vehicle sales target for the year to next March, boosted by strong sales of SUVs and pickup trucks in the United States, its biggest market.Toyota, the world’s best-selling automaker, said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit was 692.7 billion yen (4 billion pounds), exceeding the 637.3 billion yen mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.North America operating profit for the period rose 45 percent to 149.7 billion yen, the company said, adding that cost cuts and a weaker yen also helped to bolster earnings.For the year to March 2015, Toyota stuck with its full-year operating profit forecast of 2.3 trillion yen. That would be a record high, although just a 0.3 percent increase from a year earlier as the tailwind from a weaker yen that helped boost export profits runs out of steam.For the current calendar year, the company trimmed its global groupwide sales forecast to 10.22 million vehicles, a reduction of 110,000 vehicles, reflecting weakness in emerging markets.“Conditions in Thailand, India, Brazil and other emerging markets are weak,�� Managing Officer Koki Konishi told an earnings briefing.“But we’re trying our best to get an additional 50,000 vehicles out of Japan to offset some of that, and to reach around 2.3 million in the U.S.”For the financial year to March, Toyota raised its North America sales projection to 2.71 million vehicles from 2.62 million. In July, Toyota's total U.S. sales rose 12 percent, surpassing Ford Motor Co F.N to become the No.2 seller for the month. The full-year sales target for Asia excluding Japan was trimmed to 1.58 million vehicles from 1.63 million, while Europe was nudged up to 860,000 from 850,000. Japan was left unchanged at 2.21 million. The financial year forecasts are consolidated figures and exclude sales to certain regions including China.A sales-tax hike in Japan in April dented demand for new cars and Toyota’s April-June domestic sales dropped 9.6 percent year-on-year to 319,460 vehicles.Toyota's shares ended flat at 6,042 yen before the earnings announcement, compared with a 1 percent drop in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei average .N225. For the year to date, both Toyota and the benchmark have fallen 6 percent.	-0.1886630649
DETROIT, Feb 10 (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators have opened a preliminary investigation into consumer complaints of driver’s side door fires in 2007 model year Toyota Motor Corp Camry sedans and RAV4 crossover SUVs.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said an estimated 830,000 vehicles may be affected. This probe is short of a recall but may lead to one.Six consumers have complained, NHTSA said in a filing that shows the investigation was opened this week.“Based on the available information, it appears the fires are originating from the power window master switch located on the driver’s side door,�� the filing says.Toyota said it awaits more information from NHTSA before responding to the government agency.“Toyota received the Preliminary Evaluation Opening Resume for the 2007 RAV4 and Camry on February 7. However, we have not received an information request from the NHTSA. Toyota will fully cooperate with the agency in its efforts to investigate these allegations,�� the company said in an email statement.Nissan Motor Co is recalling almost 37,000 Versa small cars with manual transmissions in the United States because they potentially could be shifted out of park without depressing the brake pedal, according to documents filed with NHTSA.NHTSA said 36,608 Versas from model year 2012 with manual transmissions may experience interference between the shifter rod and shift knob. That could cause the driver to inadvertently shift the vehicle into gear without stepping on the brake pedal, increasing the risk of an accident, according to NHTSA documents.Nissan discovered the problem in November 2011 during a dealer vehicle inspection and will notify owners and replace the shifter knob or shifter assembly as necessary, NHTSA said. The recall is expected to begin on Feb. 20.A Nissan official said no accidents or injuries have been reported in relation to this issue.	4.904321379
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will showcase this month a seven-passenger vehicle aimed at young families that features sliding doors and enough interior space to hold roughly 270 soccer balls.But do not call it a minivan.A people-mover version of Ford's Transit Connect commercial van will be smaller, more fuel efficient and less expensive than the minivans sold by rivals Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Ford executives said on Tuesday.Additionally, its design -- with a high roof and squared-off rear -- will not trigger the “soccer mom stigma�� that dogs traditional minivans, particularly among the under-30 set who are beginning to start families, Ford said.“Many of them grew up in the back of a minivan,�� Ford’s head of global engineering Hau Thai-Tang said at a media event.“Historically, different cohort groups tend to reject what they’re familiar with,�� Thai-Tang added. “We think that’s another reason a product like this would be appealing to them.”Ford has been selling the Transit Connect since 2009 as a commercial vehicle with about 35,000 in sales a year. A people-mover version will debut later this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show and will go on sale by the end of next year. The van will be built in Valencia, Spain.U.S. minivan sales peaked in 2000 at just over 1.3 million and today’s sales are about half that. Ford stopped production of its Freestar minivan in 2007, turning its focus to crossovers such as the Flex and the Edge and sport-utility vehicles such as the Escape and the Explorer.Minivan sales have slowed due to a social view that it signals the driver has lost his or her individuality after becoming a parent, analysts and executives say. This distaste is acute among the younger generation known as the Millenials.“It’s not the growth opportunity it once was,�� said Ford marketing manager Tim Stoehr. “The current minivan formula has not evolved to match customers�� changing needs.”Companies have tried to upend this image through styling and marketing. The dominant player in the minivan market, Chrysler Group LLC, launched a sportier version of its Dodge Caravan last year dubbed the “man van�� that featured an all-black interior, wider tires and a stiffer suspension. Caravan sales were up 28 percent through October.In 2010, Toyota launched a popular ad campaign for its Sienna centered around a rapping couple running errands in the suburbs in their “swagger wagon.�� Sienna sales are up 3 percent this year.But the minivans on the market do not offer what customers want in terms of price of fuel economy, Thai-Tang said.“Toyota, Honda and other minivan manufacturers have left today’s customers behind with inefficient people movers that are too large and too expensive,�� he said.The 2013 Sienna starts around $26,400 while the Odyssey starts around $28,500. Ford did not provide the Transit Connect’s price, but said it will cost “thousands less�� than the Toyota and Honda minivans.Ford expects the Transit Connect will get 30 mpg on the highway. It has more than 100 cubic feet of cargo space and will be offered in five- and seven-person configurations with the option of a rear lift-gate or side-hinged cargo doors.

CHICAGO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The Obama administration’s proposed fuel economy standards for 2025 are unfairly tilted in favor of the three U.S. automakers and put their foreign-based rivals at a disadvantage, according to a House Republicans report released on Friday.According to the report written by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staff, the standards are also based on an “overly optimistic�� outlook of American consumers�� willingness to buy hybrid and electric cars. The committee is chaired by California Republican Darrell Issa.The report comes days before the White House is expected to release the fuel economy standards in their finalized form. The proposed standards call for companies to roughly double their average fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.The figure was announced last year after more than a year of talks between the Obama administration and automakers. The House Republicans�� report quotes emails and handwritten notes from executives and government officials that shed light on those negotiations over a new target for automakers�� corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE.White House spokesman Clark Stevens defended the new CAFE standards, saying they “will save families thousands of dollars at the pump and dramatically reduce oil consumption.�� Stevens said more than a dozen major automakers supported the new rules.According to Friday’s report, one key point of contention was the separate standards made for cars and light trucks, which some executives said favored General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group LLC.According to the proposed standards, automakers must show an average annual increases in fuel economy of 5 percent for cars and 3.5 percent for light trucks through 2021, with a 5 percent increase for all vehicles after that.In an email, Tom Lehner, a lobbyist for Toyota Motor Corp , described the separate fuel economy standards for light trucks as a “second auto bailout.”Toyota spokesman Steven Curtis said the Japanese automaker “has long supported a single national fuel economy program�� and has worked with the Administration on the standards for Model Years 2017-2025.“Our overriding objective was to help achieve a true, single national standard with some certainty, clarity and flexibility,�� Curtis said in an email to Reuters.The three Detroit automakers build the vast majority of trucks sold in the United States. These vehicles also boast higher profit margins than passenger cars.David Geanacopoulos, general counsel for Volkswagen’s U.S. unit, said the overall proposal “lacks competitive equity.�� He added that the light truck proposal was unfair because the largest trucks made by the U.S. automakers were under “almost no burden in the first three years.”Volkswagen, one of the few automakers which did not back the proposed rules, was not immediately available for comment.Automakers are now redesigning their cars and trucks by using lightweight, but costly materials like aluminum to meet the standards. They are also expected to build more electric vehicles and hybrids, which need pricier batteries.	0.8643042351
DETROIT, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said.Major automakers in the U.S. market report sales on Thursday, offering an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending.A Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales.Wall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14 percent drop from last November. FCA restated its U.S. sales earlier this year, bumping up last November’s count by 13,000 vehicles.Toyota Motor Corp is expected to outsell Ford Motor Co by about 8,000 vehicles. Forecasts show Ford sales flat to up 1 percent and Toyota’s sales up 3 percent to 5 percent. Usually, Ford is second in U.S. sales behind leader General Motors Co, and Toyota is generally third.GM sales are seen rising between 8 percent and 12 percent.Incentives, or discounts on new vehicles, are at historic highs, making some investors wonder whether the auto sales boom will continue. Consumer discounts cut into company profits.But major automakers say that trucks and SUVs, which have higher profit margins, are easily outselling passenger cars, leading to higher overall selling prices. Therefore, the companies are keeping discipline in matching supply with demand, major automakers have said. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)	1.4722246
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor's 7203.T close ties to its ""keiretsu"" - or family of affiliates and suppliers - have helped it become the world's top automaker. But two major production stoppages this year highlight the risks, too.The car maker's reliance on Aisin Seiki Co 7259.T, an affiliate, for door and engine parts forced Toyota to halt much of its production at virtually all its plants in Japan this week after an earthquake damaged Aisin plants in the south.The stoppage follows another week-long production halt in February after a fire at another affiliate, Aichi Steel 5482.T and could initially cost Toyota up to 90,000 vehicles and 30 billion yen ($275 million) in profit, by some estimates.Toyota says it will restart production at most of its assembly plants in Japan next week.Nonetheless, the two incidents at the two affiliates illustrate the delicate balance for manufacturers like Toyota to disaster-proof the supply chain - a crucial part of the ‘Just in Time�� production system it pioneered over half a century ago to improve efficiency and reduce wastage.“Just in Time works when everything’s running smoothly,�� said CLSA analyst Christopher Richter. “But if you balance the cost (of holding more inventory) for however long you have between these disruptive events, it would probably be worth sticking with the system.”And that’s what Toyota is doing.“The Just in Time system is to ensure we receive supply as we need and only in amounts required at the time. We have no plans to change this policy,�� a company spokesman told Reuters.“It takes time to procure the 30,000 parts we need to produce each vehicle. Bringing all these parts together is a massive process, so we’re always looking to strengthen our supply chain, but we’re not considering changing the inventories we hold (because of the recent earthquake).”Toyota says it needs to produce at least 3 million vehicles domestically each year to keep its plants, and those of its suppliers, operating efficiently, while also making its product development arm competitive.“If this base were to crumble because we shifted too many operations overseas, we would lose our domestic manufacturing expertise,�� the Toyota spokesman said.Toyota has, though, pushed some of its core suppliers to find more customers so they don’t over-rely on the ‘keiretsu�� at times of disruption.Around 62 percent of Aisin's sales now go to Toyota, down from 68 percent before the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Big, non-Toyota customers now include Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, Audi NSUG.DE, Peugeot PEUP.PA and Volvo.But the sheer size of orders from Toyota - which gobbles up 90 percent of Aisin’s Japan-made door check straps - means any disruption at just one supplier can have a disproportionate ripple-on effect across the automaker’s production lines.‘MADE IN JAPAN’Also, Toyota's 'Made-in-Japan' ethos carries risk when disaster strikes. Investors will have noted that while Toyota shut down in Japan because of quake damage to its supply chain, rival automaker Nissan Motor 7201.T remained operational.Nissan, and third-ranked Honda Motor 7267.T, make less than a fifth of their vehicles in Japan, having shifted more production overseas after 2011. Toyota produces 40 percent of its global output at home.But for Toyota, which with its group companies employs well over 150,000 people in Japan, its status as the country’s flagship company also carries a high responsibility and can come before maximizing profits in the short term.Nissan, and others, though, are changing tack to minimize the disruption from a seismically active domestic production base.“We have implemented measures since 2011 so we are better equipped to deal with natural disasters,�� said Masahide Amada, Nissan’s chief product specialist. “These include diversifying production capabilities and supply chains.”Analysts said Nissan’s plant in southern Japan avoided serious impact from the recent earthquake because it sources parts both in Japan and from South Korea and China.“Nissan sources more parts from overseas than Toyota. This gives it a longer supply chain to avoid possible disruptions,�� said Koichi Sugimoto, auto analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Nissan declined to comment in detail on its supply chain."	-7.25731321
SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N said it would stop making cars in Australia by 2017 due to high costs and a cripplingly strong currency, fuelling fears rival Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will follow suit and put the entire local autos industry at risk.The decision by the world’s second-largest auto maker to close its Holden plants in South Australia and Victoria states is the latest blow to Australia’s manufacturing industry and the auto sector in particular.“No matter which way we apply the numbers, our long term business case to make and assemble cars in this country is simply not viable,�� General Manager Mike Devereux told reporters at GM’s car plant in Adelaide on Wednesday.The decision to halt domestic production of Holden cars, long a source of national pride, will pile more pressure on Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s conservative government, which is seeking to manage a slowdown in the $1.5 trillion economy as a decade-long mining investment boom slows.GM Chairman and CEO Dan Akerson said the decision reflected a “perfect storm�� of negative influences facing the Australian automotive industry including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, and a small, fragmented and highly competitive domestic market.In May, Ford Motor Co F.N said it would shut its two Australian auto plants in October 2016, blaming similar factors.There have been widespread concerns that an exit by GM Holden would be followed by the sole remaining producer, Toyota, threatening around 150 parts and component suppliers directly employing more than 40,000 people.“You need two manufacturers to get that critical mass,�� said influential independent Senator Nick Xenophon. “You lose that critical mass, they fall like dominos.”Australian Manufacturing Workers Union national vehicles division secretary Dave Smith said it was “almost certain�� Toyota would follow suit and leave Australia.Toyota said it would work with suppliers and the government to determine its next steps and whether it could continue operating in Australia, where it employs 4,000 people and produced almost 100,000 vehicles last year.“This will place unprecedented pressure on the local supplier network and our ability to build cars in Australia,�� Toyota Australia said in a statement.The world’s largest automaker is currently negotiating changes to its workplace agreement as it seeks to improve productivity and cut costs. A worker vote is due on Friday.“A no vote is going to send a very strong message to our parent company that we are not serious about transforming our business,�� Beck Angel, spokeswoman for Toyota Australia, told Reuters before the GM announcement.Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said it was important that Toyota was given “every opportunity to survive these difficult times��.Australian manufacturing employs around 921,000 people, having declined by more than 10 percent in the past decade as the strong Australian dollar and high costs make imports more competitive.“If the automotive sector leaves then that’s a sector of manufacturing in Australia that has been a source of innovation and skills that has spilled over to other forms of manufacturing in Australia,�� said Stephen Clibborn, a lecturer in work and organisational studies at the University of Sydney Business School.Holden traces its roots in Australia to a saddle maker in 1856 and is part of the Australian psyche, fuelled by a fierce rivalry with Ford in showrooms around the country and on racetracks such as Mt Panorama at Bathurst.GM may look at shipping more South Korean-made cars to Australia as part of a global production restructuring, a source told Reuters last week.Devereux declined to comment on where it would source imported cars.Wednesday’s announcement came only one day after Devereux said the company needed more assistance from the Australian government to survive long term.Abbott’s government had earlier ruled out providing the industry further additional assistance, saying it needed to stand on its own feet.The government has also come under pressure to support flag carrier Qantas Airways Ltd QAN.AX, which is shedding 1,000 jobs in an attempt to stem mounting losses.Australia has annual sales of around 1.1 million new vehicles, but sales of locally manufactured vehicles have fallen to less than a quarter of that, from almost 389,000 in 2005.GM said it expects to record pre-tax charges of $400 million to $600 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to the closure.	0.3905600798
TOKYO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp said on Thursday it plans to cut an additional 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in September as it slims down management and its design operations.On top of 7,500 workers that took retirement packages in October, the move would cut Renesas’s workforce by roughly 25 percent from March 2012.The government-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) is expected to invest a total of 150 billion yen in Renesas along with a group of customers such as Toyota Motor Corp. The INCJ plans to take control with a two-thirds stake in the chipmaker. (Reporting by Mayumi Negishi; Editing by Paul Tait)	5.930977475
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and its two Chinese joint ventures sold about 92,300 vehicles in China in November, up 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday. That followed an 27.1 percent year-on-year jump in October and a 26.1 percent rise in September. In the first 11 months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker by sales volume sold about 907,400 vehicles in China, up 12.2 percent from a year earlier.Toyota aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China this year. If accomplished, this would see the carmaker surpass annual sales of 1 million vehicles in China for the first time, a target it originally aimed for in 2010. Last year, Toyota sold 917,500 vehicles in China.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group 601238.SS2238.HK.	-0.7110689737
* GM drops Chevrolet brand in Europe; to hit S.Korean production* GM has decided to cease Australian production - reports* GM Holden exit would threaten Australian auto industry* PM Abbott calls on GM Holden to clarify position* Australia, S.Korea just signed free trade agreementBy Hyunjoo Jin and Lincoln FeastSEOUL/SYDNEY, Dec 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co may consider shipping more South Korean-made cars to Australia, a source said on Friday, as part of a global restructuring that will see its Chevrolet brand in Europe dropped and production in Australia potentially scrapped.GM, which has been mulling its future in Australia for months, has decided to pull out as early as 2016, Australian media reported on Friday.One option that would be looked at was to supply Australia using factories in South Korea affected by GM’s announcement on Thursday that it will drop the Chevrolet brand in Europe by the end of 2015.GM Korea shipped 187,000 Chevy cars to Europe last year but the brand has failed to gain significant share in the market.“GM Korea could consider exporting Korean-made cars such as the Cruze compact to Australia if it were to shut down a plant there,�� the source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters.GM Korea has not started discussions on the plan yet, the source added.GM Korea last year exported about 30,000 vehicles including Barina/Aveo subcompact and Captiva sport utility vehicles to Australia, where they are sold under the Holden badge.Such a move might face a backlash in Australia, where there are widespread concerns that any exit by GM Holden will be followed by Toyota Motor Co, causing a collapse of the entire domestic industry.“When Holden pulls out of this country, it will be a domino effect,�� said opposition Senator John Madigan, whose state of Victoria is the one of the major centres for Australia’s auto industry.“Already car component manufacturers have lost critical mass with the decision of Ford to pull out of Australia. If another one pulls out, that’s the end, then we’re going to be hearing about Toyota - there are going to be tens of thousands of jobs lost.”A spokeswoman for Toyota Australia, which has previously said it expects to make to a decision on its manufacturing future in the country in 2014, declined to comment.Citing unnamed senior government sources, the Australian Broadcasting Corp said GM had been expected to make an announcement on its plans to quit Australia this week but had put it off until early next year.A GM spokesman in Detroit declined to comment on the reports, while Holden said its discussions with the government were ongoing. Australia’s Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane said no decision had been made.Holden, which traces its roots in Australia to a saddle maker in 1856, makes vehicles at its Elizabeth plant in South Australia and engines in Port Melbourne, Victoria, employing almost 4,000 people and producing around 95,000 vehicles a year.Australia’s auto industry has been under pressure for years as high costs, a strong local dollar, weak exports and tough international competition take a toll.In May, Ford Motor Co announced it would shut its two Australian auto plants in October 2016, following the exit of Mitsubishi Motors in 2008.The industry has been propped up by billions of dollars in government support, which has become less certain since Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s conservative coalition won power in September.“The message we are getting from Holden is they are in two minds and I would like them to clarify what their position is,�� Abbott told local radio on Friday. “There is not going to be any extra money over and above the generous support taxpayers have been giving for some time,�� he added.Adding to the pressure on the industry, Australia on Thursday signed a free trade deal with South Korea, cutting tariffs on imports of cars and car parts.“You’ve got to look at the relative size of the industry. Korea pumped out 4.5 million vehicles last year - we did 221,000 - so you can imagine the size of their supply chain,�� Richard Reilly, the chief executive of Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers said. “They are going to be getting better access to our market going forward.”Ian Park, an analyst at IHS Automotive, said he expected GM Korea to seek to export more cars to Australia after Chevy is withdrawn from Europe, boosted by the trade deal.GM Korea said in a statement that: “The phase-out of Chevrolet in Western and Eastern Europe will increase focus on driving profitability, managing costs and maximising sales opportunities in Korea.”Even before the FTA, vehicles were Australia’s second-largest import from South Korea, worth more than A$2 billion last year.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also said the trade deal could offer opportunities in Australia for GM’s Korean-made cars.“It also serves to put a little pressure on the Koreans. The costs in Korea are rising. The labour environment is not the friendliest in the world,�� he told Reuters.	-1.845952789
"BENGALURU, Aug 8 (Reuters) - India’s Jamna Auto Industries Ltd, a maker of springs used in vehicle suspensions, said on Thursday it might shut all its plants in August due to weak demand from its customers, underscoring the extent of a slowdown in the auto sector.The company, one of India’s largest makers of tapered leaf springs and parabolic springs for automobiles, joins a growing list of auto components manufacturers, including Bosch Ltd and Wabco India Ltd, that have trimmed production amid a demand slump.India’s auto sector is facing a downturn, which industry executives say is the worst suffered by the industry, triggering massive job cuts and factory shutdowns.Initial estimates suggest that automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April, a senior industry source told Reuters earlier this week.New Delhi-based Jamna Auto's customers include General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Tata Motors Ltd , India's largest automaker by revenue, according to the company's website here.""In view of the weak customer schedule and high inventory, the company has made changes in production schedule at all its plants. The plants may not run or partially run on all working days in August,"" Jamna Auto said in a filing here to the exchanges.The company has nine manufacturing facilities across the country.

WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which lags the auto industry in fuel efficiency, purchased U.S. greenhouse gas emissions credits from rival automakers Toyota Motor Corp, Tesla Motors Inc and Honda Motor Co, a government report released on Wednesday show.The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that the Italian American automaker has purchased about 8.2 million megagrams of emissions credits. A megagram is equal to 1,000 kilograms and is calculated on emissions saved over legal requirements.The government does not disclose how much automakers pay for credits. The report shows trading in credits jumped by nearly 400 percent in the 2014 model year - the most recent for which data is available.Even without acquiring credits, Fiat Chrysler still would have been in compliance in the 2014 model year, the report said.“We have made significant strides - often exceeding industry averages - in improving the performance of those types of vehicles most preferred by our customers,�� the company said.Fiat Chrysler said it earned credits for making improvements to air conditioning systems and other technological improvements.Fiat Chrysler, which previously purchased nearly 1.7 million megagrams of emissions credits from Tesla, Nissan Motor Co and Honda, acquired another 6.5 million credits through the end of the 2014 model year, the report shows.Fiat Chrysler ranked last among major automakers with a fleetwide fuel efficiency of 20.8 miles per gallon for the 2014 model year and is projected to nearly tie General Motors Co in the 2015 year at 21.8 mpg for last place, EPA said.The new purchases include 5.5 million in credits from Toyota and Honda and about 1 million from Tesla.Fiat Chrysler had a credit balance of 13.8 million credits at the end of the 2014 model year.This is the first time Toyota has chosen to sell credits.Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz unit has acquired about 1.4 million credits, including 500,000 additional credits from Nissan, according to the report. Without the credits, it would be in a deficit since it had about 200,000 credits remaining at the end of 2014.Ferrari NV, which was spun off by Fiat Chrysler earlier this year, acquired another 175,000 credits and has purchased 265,000 credits.Tesla sold all of its 2013 and 2014 greenhouse gas emissions credits to Fiat Chrysler. Tesla earned $216.3 million in all regulatory credit sales in 2014 and $194.4 million in 2013 but does not breakout transactions. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Bill Trott)	-7.836538462
NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. industry sales in March have been strong, with the annual sales rate tracking at a pace that would top 15 million for the fifth consecutive month, a senior U.S. executive for Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday.Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice president for U.S. auto operations, said the Japanese automaker is “very optimistic�� about the economy in 2013 - citing a jobs recovery, rising consumer confidence and an improving housing market.“So far, this month of March looks to be very good for all manufacturers,�� Carter told industry executives at a conference ahead of the New York auto show. He said industry sales are tracking up 6.6 percent in March, with an annual rate of 15.2 million to 15.3 million vehicles.Carter said Toyota sees U.S. industry sales finishing this year at 15.3 million, which would be up from 14.5 million last year, and the U.S. gross domestic product growing about 2 percent.He also expects Toyota’s brands - Toyota, Lexus and Scion - to top 2.2 million in sales this year, or up from more than 2.08 million last year. He said Toyota will launch nine new or updated vehicles, including the Toyota RAV4 SUV and Tundra pickup truck, in the U.S. market.Carter said Toyota will offer more vehicles in the U.S. designed in this market, such as the new Avalon large car. He said he would like to see the company add a sports car and expand its truck lines, and that those areas are being studied.The next Corolla small car, which the company will have more news about later this year, will include high fuel efficiency and improved styling, Carter said.He reiterated that Toyota will offer a fuel-cell hybrid vehicle by 2015, and it plans to launch 20 new or redesigned hybrid vehicles globally in the same time frame.	12.00775946

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei average is expected to rise on Wednesday, helped by a sharp fall in the yen after central bank Governor Masaaki Shirakawa decided to step down three weeks earlier than expected, possibly bringing forward an anticipated shift to a more aggressive monetary policy.Currency-sensitive exporters were expected to lead the market higher after the yen hit a 33-month low of 93.79 yen to the dollar in early Asian trade on Wednesday.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has put the central bank under relentless pressure to do more to lift the economy and made it clear he wants someone in the job who will be bolder than the outgoing BOJ chief in loosening monetary policy.Analysts said the Nikkei .N225 was expected to trade between 11,150 and 11,250 after ending down 1.9 percent to 11,046.92 on Tuesday.Nikkei futures in Chicago closed at 11,265 on Tuesday, up 1.7 percent from the Osaka close of 11,080.“The market’s consensus is that it wants a BOJ governor who shares the government’s push to reflate the economy with aggressive easing, and the news raised expectations for an appointment of such governor,�� said Hiroichi Nishi, assistant general manager at SMBC Nikko Securities.Better-than-expected euro zone data may also help sentiment.

(Adds more brand rankings including fall of Mercedes-Benz, Buick Regal as top sports sedan)DETROIT, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand finished on top of the Consumer Reports annual “brand report card�� for the third straight year, the influential U.S. magazine said on Tuesday.Japanese brands took four of the top five places. Mazda Motor Corp was second and the best finisher among non-luxury brands. Toyota came in third, followed by Volkswagen AG’s Audi from Germany and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd’s Subaru from Japan.For the first time, a U.S. brand made the top 10. General Motor Co’s Buick came in seventh, just behind VW’s Porsche.Ranking eighth through 10th were namesake brands from Honda Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and BMW .The Buick Regal was named best sports sedan model, displacing last year’s champion, the BMW 328i.“Today, many domestic models can go toe-to-toe with the best imports,�� said Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing at Consumer Reports.Falling the most in the brand ratings was Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, to 21st from 10th last year. Consumer Reports said several models, including the CLA, were unreliable.For the second year in a row, Tesla Motors Inc’s Model S was named the best model overall.The Audi A6 was named the best luxury car for the third straight year.The Subaru Forester was named the top small SUV, and the Toyota Highlander the top mid-sized SUV.The Chevrolet Impala from GM was named best large sedan.Consumer Reports subscribers rated 1.1 million vehicles in the annual auto survey. The results come from those ratings, along with U.S. government and insurance industry safety tests and road tests by the magazine’s staff.No pickup truck was named as best. Last year’s winner, the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Ram 1500, was not reliable enough, Consumer Reports said, and the best-selling model in the United States, Ford Motor Co’s F-150, is too new to have a testing record. Consumer Reports also judged the GM Chevrolet Silverado as unreliable and the Chevrolet Colorado as too new for testing results.Of all the brands in the survey, Buick had the greatest percentage of its models “recommended�� for purchase, at 83 percent. No other U.S. brand had even half of its models recommended.Lexus got “recommended�� ratings for 78 percent of its models tested, compared with Mazda, 67 percent; Toyota, 68 percent; Audi, 56 percent; and Subaru, 80 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German luxury automaker Audi on Tuesday topped the annual ranking of new vehicles by influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports despite the brand's emissions-cheating scandal while quality problems hurt Tesla Motors Inc's TSLA.O Model S luxury car.Audi was followed by Fuji Heavy Industries' 7270.T Subaru unit, Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus brand, Porsche and BMW AG BMWG.DE.Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE Audi unit was named best overall brand, based on the magazine's road testing, reliability, safety and owner satisfaction scores.In September, VW admitted to secretly installing software that allowed its vehicles to emit up to 40 times legally allowable limits. In November, Audi admitted using separate software that allowed its diesel U.S. SUVs and larger cars to emit excess emissions and was forced to halt U.S. sales of new diesel vehicles indefinitely.Consumer Reports did not rank any VW Group U.S. diesel vehicles since they cannot legally be sold.David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research, said the top ranking would help Audi even though its image has not suffered as much as its parent’s.Audi U.S. sales were up 2.7 percent in January, while VW brand sales were down 15 percent. “Audi hasn’t borne the brunt of what happened,�� Cole said.Tesla’s Model S electric car was named Consumer Report’s best overall car in 2014 and 2015, but this year the magazine opted not to name any best overall vehicle.Jake Fisher, director of auto testing, said because of faltering reliability scores, the Model S is no longer the top ultraluxury car and ranks behind the BMW 750i xDrive, Lexus LS 460L and Audi A8 L. He said Tesla’s quality problems including issues with hatches, door handles, electric motors and batteries have increased as the automaker has ramped up production.“They are having issues and they need to work that out before they introduce new models,�� Fisher said.Consumer Reports unveiled the results in Washington. The non-profit magazine has more than 8 million subscribers and gets survey data from 740,000 owners. Many car shoppers consult the ratings, and automakers routinely tout favorable ratings in advertising.U.S. brands lagged most other automakers, but General Motors Co's GM.N Buick brand ranked seventh, just ahead of Mazda. Motor Corp 7261.T. Toyota finished eighth, ahead of Hyundai Motor Co's Kia unit and Honda Motor Co's 7267.T Honda brand. The Volkswagen brand ranked 15th overall.GM’s top-selling Chevrolet brand ranked 20th, while the GMC brand ranked 23rd and Cadillac 24th.Ford Motor Co's F.N Ford brand ranked 16th, but its best-selling F-150 pickup truck was named best pickup for the first time since 1999.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI continued to struggle in the rankings. The automaker's Fiat unit finished last among 30 brands rated, with its Jeep brand in 29th place. FCA's Dodge and Chrysler brands also rated near the bottom.Fiat Chrysler said in a statement it is aggressively working to improve quality.Tesla did not have enough models tested to be considered for overall brand scores.	3.92006884

DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MIFCAU.N and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T are lagging behind top North American competitors in the health of their working relationships with suppliers, an annual study found on Monday. As in prior years, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T ranked first and second in the study, which looked at the six biggest automakers in North America. Ford Motor Co F.N was ranked third and General Motors Co GM.N fourth.Automakers�� profitability is linked to good working relations with their suppliers, said study author John Henke, head of Planning Perspectives, a firm that focuses on company-supplier relations in various industries.Major automakers spend 70 to 80 percent of their revenue on parts, components and materials from suppliers. Henke’s research has shown that automakers make more profit when they have better working relations with suppliers, in part by getting price concessions and gaining access to the best products.“Strong, profitable industry-leading companies are those with the strongest, collaborative supplier relations,�� said Henke.The study covered 2015 and does not offer a figure for profit lost due to poor supplier relations. A year ago, Henke estimated that in 2014, automakers collectively could have added $2 billion in operating profit by improving working relations with their suppliers.Since the study began in 2002, Toyota has been first and Honda second in supplier relations, except for two years when the two Japanese automakers swapped the two top spots.The study shows the results of surveys of 647 salespeople at 492 suppliers to the six automakers. The study uses survey responses to illustrate basic business practices and automaker behavior in buying and purchasing situations involving automotive materials, parts and components.Using a point system devised by Henke and based on survey responses, the six automakers were ranked.GM, which last year was tied for last place, improved the most in its relations with suppliers in the past year, Henke said. Fiat Chrysler was at the bottom of the six automakers studied, closely behind Nissan. FCA has been either last or next to last in the study since 2008. Nissan dropped the most in the past year, partly because Nissan representatives became adversaries with suppliers and applied intense pressure to drop prices, Henke said.	1.646498711

Toyota has not yet decided whether to mass-produce it.“Our concept was to offer something that’s both fun and convenient for city driving,�� i-Road chief engineer Akihiro Yanaka told Reuters.Devising smarter ways to get around - known in the industry as “smart mobility�� - looks set to become a new battleground for automakers as urbanization grows, pollution worsens, and more cars clog up cities in emerging markets.Germany’s Daimler has taken the lead with car2go, where its 1 million-plus members in 30 European and North American cities use a mobile app to reserve the tiny Smart Fortwo car, many of which are zero-emission. Drivers pay by the minute and can drop the car off at various spots around town.Ford Motor Co in January announced the Ford Smart Mobility initiative that would involve various types of trials around the world including a car-sharing service in London.Toyota also has car-sharing experiments underway in its namesake city as well as in France’s Grenoble, but Tokyo would be its first in a major metropolis, which it says would benefit most from the i-Road.“Data shows that about 70 percent of cars in big cities are occupied by one person, with most traveling less than 10 km (6.2 miles),�� said Toshiya Hayata, group manager of Toyota’s Smart Community department. “That means the mode of transportation doesn’t have to be a car.”In the upcoming trial, users can lease one of five i-Roads from the upmarket Ginza shopping district for 412 yen ($3) per 15 minutes, dropping it off at any of five spots in the capital.To turn the trial into a viable business, Toyota said it would need to slash costs both for the i-Road and for operating a car-sharing network.“But Daimler doesn’t have anything smaller than the Smart,�� Yanaka said. “If we can make it work, the i-Road could have an advantage.��	-1.575366989
DETROIT (Reuters) - A consortium of 10 automakers led by Toyota Motor Corp plans to hire an independent engineering firm and a former top U.S. auto safety regulator to investigate a rash of problems with air bags supplied by Japan's Takata Corp 7312.T, the group said on Wednesday.The carmakers want a forensic engineering firm “to address the technical issues with Takata air bag inflators,�� Toyota spokeswoman Julie Hamp said in a statement on behalf of the group, which refers to itself as the joint initiative.David Kelly, a former acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is the lead candidate to coordinate the probe, said people familiar with the effort. The automakers have recalled more than 14 million vehicles with defective air bags since 2008.Takata said it has agreed to support the industry consortium in its investigation. In a statement, the supplier said it “is also conducting extensive testing and has engaged top automotive engineers and scientists from around the world to assist in evaluating inflator ruptures and discovering the root cause of these issues.”In December, Takata named Samuel Skinner, former U.S. secretary of transportation, to head a “quality assurance panel�� to review the company’s policies and responsiveness to automakers and regulators.Toyota invited other automakers in early December to join “a coordinated industry-wide joint initiative to independently test�� Takata air bag inflators involved in the recalls.News that the group was considering Kelly was reported Thursday by the Detroit News and the Wall Street Journal.Toyota said the group’s goal was to address issues related to the Takata inflators, which can rupture and spray shrapnel at vehicle occupants. The defective inflators have been linked to at least six deaths, all in Honda cars, and dozens of injuries.Honda Motor Co 7267.T, which has been Takata's largest customer, is part of the joint initiative, as are General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU.N, BMW AG BMWG.DE, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T and Fuji Heavy Industries Inc's 7270.T Subaru.	2.770608775

BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, long opposed to producing its premium Lexus cars in China because of concerns over quality and profitability, is now considering it to ignite growth and narrow sales gaps with its German rivals, four company insiders told Reuters.The company, which imports Lexus models made in Japan to sell in China, has spent the last two years researching how to produce them locally.Toyota also talked to its Chinese joint-venture partners �� Guangzhou Automobile Group Co and FAW Group - last year about Lexus models. It wasn’t clear whether Toyota approached the Chinese companies about a partnership or vice versa.Local production would be a major shift for the world’s largest automaker, encouraged by improved China-Japan ties, as well as new Chinese investment rules that might allow foreign automakers to fully own or majority-control China operations.“We’re torn over this,�� said one of the insiders.“But it makes little sense to let this opportunity slip by,�� another told Reuters.All four insiders declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.China’s planned scrapping of foreign ownership restrictions in the auto industry is in part a response to criticism that Chinese companies have been largely allowed to invest freely in outside markets while Beijing limits foreign firms�� access to the world’s second-largest economy.The rule changes - affecting electric carmakers this year and others by 2022 - led Tesla Inc to gain Beijing’s approval for a wholly-owned China manufacturing and sales company in Shanghai. That marked the first time a foreign carmaker established itself in China without a partner.Toyota already produces numerous Toyota-brand models, including the Camry, Highlander, Corolla, Levin and Crown, in China with partners. Last year it sold 1.29 million cars there, including imported Lexuses.Toyota had contemplated moving Lexus production to China before - as far back as 2011-12, according to one of the four insiders.But it had until now considered a potential erosion of quality too much of a risk, and didn’t want to sacrifice the brand’s relatively high margins by sharing profits with a local partner.Two of the Toyota insiders said the automaker had identified specific scenarios for localizing Lexus.“All the preparation has been more or less completed,�� one said. “All we’re waiting is a ‘go�� from management.”Toyota’s preferred option is to own all or most of a localized Lexus unit, which it could do immediately by building only electric cars. (Lexus has plans for electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid versions of existing models.)But China might not let another brand in when the market has slowed down significantly, with sales of some foreign vehicles, including Groupe PSA, Ford and Hyundai, all falling in the gutter in recent months.“You’d still need a good political follow-wind to execute this,�� one of the sources said, pointing to help from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has a state visit to China planned for this month.Even as other premium brands - such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac - have opened assembly plants in China to gain market share, Toyota has resisted.That reluctance reflects the company’s unwillingness to share with a Chinese partner a brand painstakingly built since 1989 into a top premium car in the United States.Opponents inside Toyota also point to China’s lowering tariffs on passenger cars to 15 percent from 25 percent in July as a reason to keep importing Lexuses.They also note that the nearest Lexus plant to China is at the northern tip of Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu -only two days from Shanghai by sea.A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said “the most important task�� for Lexus is to become a distinguished brand in China.“We always weigh the need for localizing production as part of the consideration for the Lexus brand’s future in China,�� he said. “But at this point in time, we don’t have any specific plans for producing Lexus cars in China.”Nonetheless, support for localization is growing among Toyota leaders.China has typically been a difficult market for Japanese companies, but there is new optimism, especially after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May.During his visit, Li toured Toyota facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, escorted by the company’s family scion and chief executive, Akio Toyoda.Toyoda has since sought to boost his company’s presence in China, including an effort to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity and distribution networks, and share more technologies with Chinese companies.China has also proposed limiting new production capacity for automakers, adding an incentive for Toyota to move quickly if it wants to build Lexus models there.Nissan Motor Co and Toyota have each recently revealed plans to boost capacity, much of which will be used to produce electric cars.Alan Kang, a Shanghai-based analyst for consultancy LMC Automotive, thinks localizing production is exactly what Lexus needs to start narrowing the big sales gap with German premium brands.Mercedes-Benz, for example, last year sold about 610,000 vehicles, compared to 130,000 for Lexus during the same year, according to LMC.“If Lexus doesn’t want to remain a niche, it needs to start investing more,�� Kang said.	-5.184028919
(Reuters) - Sirius XM Holdings Inc cannot force owners of vehicles sold with trial subscriptions to its satellite radio service to arbitrate disputes, a federal appeals court decided on Monday, in a case involving alleged unsolicited sales calls.In reversing a lower court ruling, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said owners may try to pursue their claims as a group rather than in individual arbitrations, which can be costly and time-consuming.The panel found no showing that plaintiff Erik Knutson, a San Diego-area real estate broker, agreed to arbitrate disputes with Sirius when he bought his Toyota Tacoma truck in Nov. 2011.“A reasonable person in Knutson’s position could not be expected to understand that purchasing a vehicle from Toyota would simultaneously bind him to any contract with Sirius XM, let alone one that contained an arbitration provision without any notice of such terms,�� Circuit Judge Harry Pregerson wrote for the panel.A 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving AT&amp;T Inc made it easier for companies to require consumers to arbitrate disputes, but called arbitration “a matter of contract.”Patrick Reilly, a Sirius spokesman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Sirius has contracts with Toyota and several other automakers to install satellite radio receivers in new vehicles.Knutson accused New York-based Sirius of violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making three unauthorized calls to his cell phone in the 90-day trial subscription period after he bought his truck.Sirius countered that Knutson was bound by a “customer agreement�� containing the arbitration clause, and included in a “Welcome Kit�� sent a month after he bought his truck. Knutson said he never read or assented to the customer agreement.“The 9th Circuit, 100 percent got it right,�� said Abbas Kazerounian, a lawyer for Knutson, in a phone interview. “There was no meeting of the minds in the contract.”The 9th Circuit returned the case to U.S. District Judge Anthony Battaglia in San Diego for further proceedings.The case is Knutson et al v.

FRANKFURT, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Toyota doesn’t think it will sell as many cars in Germany as it originally hoped this year as it has failed to keep up with demand for its hybrid-powered cars in the country, an executive told a German paper.“Reaching 80,000 cars this year will not be possible,�� the head of Toyota Germany, Toshiaki Yasuda, told Handelsblatt newspaper in an advance copy of an interview to be published on Thursday.“Right now, I think it will be more like 78,000,�� he told the paper.Yasuda said Toyota had been too slow in delivering the battery packs needed for hybrid cars from Japan.“Hybrid cars make up around 40 percent of our sales, but if you look at the real demand it’s more like 60 percent,�� Yasuda said, adding that waiting times for its Prius, Auris and Yaris hybrid cars were now down to between three and four months, from a previous six to nine months.

TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday posted a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit, beating estimates, on the back of sales growth in Asia and cost reductions in that region and at home.Operating profit at Japan’s largest automaker was 682.6 billion yen ($6.11 billion) for April-June, versus 574.3 billion yen a year earlier.The result compared with the 638.74 billion yen average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Toyota maintained its forecast for full-year profit to slip 4.2 percent to 2.3 trillion yen, as it anticipates a stronger yen will offset benefits of cost cuts and record-high global vehicle sales.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies may be facing uncertainty as the coronavirus pandemic triggers a collapse in demand for their products, but auto makers are betting the crisis will help accelerate an electric future.With economies reeling from lockdowns to curb the virus, the sharpest plunge in oil prices in two decades has slashed the cost of filling up a tank of gas, eroding some of the incentive to make the switch to cleaner fuels.Looking ahead, cuts in capital spending forced upon energy companies as their revenues crumble could tighten supply enough to cause a spike in oil prices, making electric vehicles more attractive just as automakers ramp up production, analysts say.“We think this will lead to a tipping point, accelerating the switch to electric vehicles in many more countries around 2023-24,�� Per Magnus Nysveen, senior partner at Rystad Energy, a consultancy in Oslo, told Reuters.“We will start to see that this starts to dig into global oil demand in a very significant way,�� he said.According to a Reuters analysis of 27 automakers compiled in partnership with Constellation Research &amp; Technology, most companies apart from Elon Musk's Tesla Inc TSLA.O and China's BYD Co Ltd 002594.SZ are still in the early stages of transitioning to EVs, which make up a fraction of global sales. (For an interactive graphic on business model transformation and decarbonization within the auto manufacturing sector, see: here)With mid-sized to large petroleum-fuelled SUVs and trucks driving much of the recent growth in the auto sector, many companies are banking on these high-emitting gas-guzzlers to drive their near-term performance.Nevertheless, with China's BAIC Motor Corp 1958.HK and German rivals Volkswagen Group VOWG_p.DE and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE pursuing some of the industry's most ambitious decarbonisation targets, investors are increasingly using a company's EV prospects as a proxy for future success.“All the growth in transportation is being eaten by electricity,�� said Harry Benham, chairman of Ember-Climate, a British energy transition think-tank. “Oil and gas companies have got no ability to defeat electricity as a transport fuel.”With fuel for road transport accounting for about half of all oil demand, the possibility of a faster-than-expected switch to EVs in the wake of the pandemic is one of the main reasons some forecasts for a peak have been brought forward.Global oil demand hit a record of just over 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019. Rystad now sees demand topping out at 106.5 million-107 million bpd in 2027-2028. The consultancy had previously forecast a marginally higher peak in 2030.Although the oil industry has defied numerous attempts to call “peak oil�� in the past, the fact that the International Energy Agency projects that demand will plunge by a record 8.6 million bpd this year has reignited the debate.Though as yet a minority view, some believe the pandemic is reshaping patterns of work, aviation and commuting so profoundly that oil demand might never return to 2019 levels - a potential boost to hopes of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.“It’s inconceivable that all that demand for oil comes back in one go, so the real question is how much of that is lost permanently,�� said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management.Underscoring the changing economics of transport, Reuters revealed last week that Tesla plans to introduce a new low-cost, long-life battery in its Model 3 sedan in China that it expects to bring the cost of EVs in line with gasoline models.Despite such potential breakthroughs, the Constellation data shows that automakers still have a long way to go to align themselves with climate goals enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, with Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI among the biggest laggards. Volkswagen has announced some of the most aggressive long-term plans to decarbonise its fleet, but the company still has to prove it can build EVs at scale, and has led the field in ramping up sales of mid- and large SUVs, the data shows.Although the public decarbonisation targets of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T are only a little bolder than the industry average, the company's proven capacity to build hybrids may bode well for its EV ambitions, the data suggests.Japan's Subaru Corp 7270.T, which produces only a small number of hybrid vehicles, might have to rely on its partnership with Toyota if it wants to prosper as demand for EVs picks up, Constellation analysts said.‘CRISIS OF UNCERTAINTY’Although the oil industry hopes to offset demand lost to EVs with a growing appetite for crude to make petrochemicals and plastics, companies facing growing pressure from investors over climate change are increasingly open about the risks.In April, Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, said the company did not expect oil demand to recover in the medium term, saying the industry was living in a ""crisis of uncertainty"". Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP BP.L, was later quoted in the Financial Times as saying he would not ""write off"" the possibility the world had reached peak oil.Much will depend on whether economies stage a V-shaped recovery, as some forecasters predict, and how far governments adopt new EV targets as part of “green stimulus�� packages to spur a faster shift to a low-carbon future.With many European politicians calling for green recoveries, the French government signalled on Monday that the country wants to boost sales of low-emission cars. China has extended backing for EVs as part of its recovery package, and U.S. Democrats are exploring ways to boost demand for clean vehicles.With various European countries planning to ultimately ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars, some see increasingly ambitious EV commitments by automakers as another sign of the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.“One of the primary factors holding back the transition has been resistance by the fossil fuel incumbents,�� said Kingsmill Bond, senior strategist at financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. “Now those incumbents are significantly weakened.��(GRAPHIC: Reuters sustainability - Automobiles - here)"	6.651644133
(This Nov. 3 story corrects year of previous record to 2000 instead of 1999, number of vehicles sold that year to 17.35 million instead of 17.8 million, and adds WardsAuto as the source)DETROIT (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry is on track for a record year of annual sales, General Motors Co GM.N said on Tuesday, as the top U.S. automaker and its rivals reported October sales that far exceeded expectations.GM said U.S. auto sales are on pace to end 2015 topping the 2000 record of 17.35 million vehicles sold, according to WardsAuto figures.At a seasonally adjusted annualized rate, October sales were 18.24 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp, which is the highest October level since 2001, when automakers offered zero percent financing in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the company said.In 2009, at the depth of the Great Recession, U.S. auto sales dipped to 10.4 million vehicles.U.S. October auto industry sales rose 13.6 percent from a year ago. Analysts had forecasted October sales to be 8 to 12 percent higher than last year. A Reuters poll of 45 economists showed expectations of a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 17.7 million vehicles for last month.“October was a huge month for the industry, smashing expectations and continuing its hot streak,�� said Bill Fay, Toyota’s U.S. general manager.The booming October sales materialized despite concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending and stagnant wages.U.S. economic data suggests consumer spending lost momentum at the end of the third quarter, with consumption in September posting its smallest increase in eight months. Personal incomes also barely rose that month.GM said its sales rose 16 percent to 262,993 vehicles last month, marking its best October since 2004.Ford Motor Co F.N, No. 2 in the U.S. auto market by sales, reported it sold 213,938 vehicles last month, a 13 percent rise from the same period last year. Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said the company commanded record average selling prices for its vehicles, at $34,600 per vehicle.Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE sales were essentially unchanged, well below the overall industry, as it feels the sting of a diesel emissions scandal. Volkswagen sold 30,400 vehicles in the United States last month.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU.NFCHA.MI reported its 67th straight month of year-over-year gains, selling 195,545 vehicles in October, up 14.7 percent from a year earlier.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.TTM.N said it sold 204,045 vehicles in October, up 13 percent.Honda Motor Co 7267.T sales rose 9.3 percent to 131,651 vehicles.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said its U.S. sales rose 12.5 percent to 116,047 vehicles in October.	0.2322601313
TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp raised its annual net profit forecast by 13 percent on Wednesday, backed by a weaker yen that makes exports more profitable and by solid vehicle sales in the United States, its biggest market.The world’s best-selling carmaker now expects 1.67 trillion yen ($16.95 billion) in net profit for the year ending in March 2014, compared to a previous forecast of 1.48 trillion yen.That is just short of the record net profit of 1.72 trillion yen Toyota booked in the year ended March 2008, and compares with an average forecast of 1.79 trillion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 23 analysts.The company’s first-half net profit rose 83 percent to 1.0 trillion yen.Toyota, which is the most export-reliant among Japan’s three big carmakers, has benefited the most from a weakening yen that boosts profits both from exports and from converting money made overseas back into yen.U.S. sales in July-September for Toyota, the third-biggest carmaker in that country, rose 12.2 percent from a year ago to 589,390 vehicles, helped by strong sales of the redesigned Corolla compact and the Lexus IS. It outperformed industry-wide vehicle sales that increased 8.9 percent year-on-year.Toyota sold the most number of cars among automakers worldwide in January-September, beating General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG.	-5
PRAGUE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Czech car production fell for the first time in nine years in 2012, down 1.7 percent to 1.17 million, the Automotive Industry Association said.The automotive sector is a major driver for an export-reliant Czech economy stuck in recession, accounting for about a fifth of industrial output and exports.Car sales in several European countries fell to the lowest levels in years in 2012, with December registration data underscoring challenges facing the broader economy. Automakers are facing a sustained slump as the euro zone debt crisis and government austerity measures hit demand.The Czech sector is dominated by German carmaker Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto unit, which accounted for 56 percent of 2012 car production, the car industry association said on Monday.South Korean group Hyundai Motor’s Czech plant’s share of production rose to 26 percent, while a joint venture of Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor and French peer PSA Peugeot Citroen accounted for 18 percent.Data from the final quarter of 2012 signalled the Czech economy likely continued in recession, struggling with poor consumer sentiment and slowing trade amid the euro zone crisis.Industrial output in November fell 3.9 percent, according to the latest data, and a purchasing manager survey has been stuck in negative territory.

"TOKYO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T will begin production at its new Mexico factory in January, the carmaker's chief said on Wednesday, describing the plant as a key foreign base for the Japanese company as it pares its reliance on domestic output.“I just visited the Mexican plant and all preparations are complete,�� Mazda’s head, Masamichi Kogai said at a press conference at the Tokyo Motor Show. “This factory will become a crucial overseas base for Mazda,�� he added.Selling just over a million cars a year and with most of its vehicles built in high-cost Japan, Mazda has struggled to compete with bigger automakers that are 10 times its size. In the four years to March 2012, the company chalked up combined net losses of nearly 250 billion yen ($2.5 billion).Since losing the backing of Ford Motor Co F.N, which once owned a third of the Hiroshima-based company, Mazda has drawn closer to Toyota Motor Co 7203.T winning access to its hybrid technology. Mazda will also build cars for Toyota at the Mexico plant.Meanwhile, the company’s China chief executive said Mazda had cut its 2013 China sales target by 7.5 percent to 185,000 vehicles due to tough competition from its rivals.Mazda now aims to sell about the same number of vehicles as last year, said Nobuhiko Watabe.""Competition is fierce and it's not just from the other Japanese carmakers,"" Watabe told Reuters and other reporters in Shanghai last week, adding pressure was also coming from other foreign models such as Ford Motor Co.'s F.N Focus.“It’s been a tough fight.”Most Japanese carmakers have only been making a tepid recovery since last year when sales were hammered by a flare up in anti-Japanese sentiment triggered by a territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing over tiny, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.“We had hoped to sell 200,000 units this year as the impact of the island dispute fades, but we’re now looking at more or less around last year’s level at 185,000,�� Watabe said at the small group interview.During the first 10 months of the year, Mazda sold a total of 142,571 vehicles, down 9.5 percent from a year earlier. Watabe said the drop in sales this year was also due to a high base from last year when strong demand for the Mazda3 Xingcheng boosted sales in the first half of 2012.Bigger Japanese rivals Toyota, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T have seen their sales rise 5 percent, 7 percent and 16 percent during the same period, respectively.Mazda was hoping to set a higher 2014 sales target compared with this year but had not yet finalized the figure, Watabe said.“Our CX-5 has been received very well and with the localization in production of the ATENZA and Mazda3 planned for next year, we hoping to jump up from this year’s level,�� he added.China’s auto market has rebounded strongly from last year, with sales volume rising over 13 percent during the January-October period compared with a year earlier.Mazda recognizes the importance of capturing demand in lower-tier cities where the economy has been expanding quicker than in major coastal cities like Shanghai or Guangzhou, but needs to be careful in its strategy, Watabe said.“As growth slows in major cities, we need to shift inland. But cost efficiency in these areas are much lower because the population is dispersed,�� he added."	-5.04736884
