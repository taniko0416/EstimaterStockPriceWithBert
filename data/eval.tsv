TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T on Tuesday said operating profit rose 36 percent in its first quarter, beating estimates, as strong sales in Asia helped drive the Japanese automaker's recovery from a domestic mileage cheating scandal in 2016.Operating profit at Japan’s sixth-biggest automaker was 28.1 billion yen ($252.65 million) for April-June, compared with a 25.9 billion yen average of four analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The result comes as Mitsubishi Motors slowly wins back customers at home - where sales rose 11 percent in the quarter - after its admission in 2016 that it had overstated mileage readings on domestic models shook trust in the company.Sales in Southeast Asia rose 28 percent, and the automaker’s strength in the region has bolstered investors�� expectations on a strong recovery from the scandal, making Mitsubishi Motors the best-performing stock among major Japanese automakers over the past three months.In that period, its shares have climbed 17 percent, beating a 10 percent slide at Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T - which owns a controlling stake in the automaker - and a 3 percent rise at Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.Behind the sales jump in Southeast Asia were brisk sales of the recently launched Xpander multipurpose vehicle, which has been selling strongly in Indonesia and which Mitsubishi Motors has begun to export to other Asian markets.Southeast Asia is a key market for the Japanese automaker, accounting for nearly half of its global vehicle sales. The strong Xpander sales in Indonesia have doubled its market share in the country to around 14 percent since January.Across member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Mitsubishi Motors boasts a market share of around 7 percent, trailing only much bigger rivals Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T.At home, sales have been lifted by strong performance of its newest model, the Eclipse Cross compact sport utility vehicle, launched in March.In China and Taiwan, sales rose 37 percent on the year, due to strong sales of the Outlander SUV.The automaker is also making inroads in North America, where sales rose 25 percent. Mitsubishi Motors has been struggling to expand in the United States in past years, resulting in the shuttering of its only plant in the country in 2016, and is now dependent on imports for new sales in the market.In the U.S., the prospect of a hike in import tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent could stymie Mitsubishi Motors�� plans to boost sales in the country by around 15 percent this year to 110,000 units.($1 = 111.2200 yen)	-7.087209742
MANILA, June 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to invest 3.22 billion pesos ($70 million) in its Philippine division to increase local output and qualify for a new tax incentive, the government of the Southeast Asian nation said in a statement on Wednesday.The Japanese automaker will build 230,000 Vios subcompact sedans under a $600 million six-year incentive program that the government introduced last year to boost automotive output and raise regional competitiveness, the Board of Investments said.Rommel Gutierrez, first vice-president for Government Affairs at Toyota Motor Philippines, confirmed the automaker had plans to invest, but declined to elaborate ahead of a company statement scheduled for Thursday.Toyota’s investment would follow a similar move by compatriot Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which in February said it would invest $91 million to build 200,000 Mirage and Mirage G4 cars starting in 2017.Toyota Motor Philippines, a joint venture with local conglomerate GT Capital Holdings Inc, already builds Vios and Innova cars at a factory south of the capital Manila. The automaker is the Philippines�� biggest by sales.The Board of Investments also said it expects auto parts makers working with Toyota and Mitsubishi to generate more than $388 million in fresh investment due to the government’s Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy.

TOKYO/BERLIN (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp reported a drop in first-half vehicle sales on Thursday following a series of production stoppages, falling behind Volkswagen which became the world’s top-selling carmaker in the first six months of 2016 despite its emissions scandal.The Japanese company, which manufactures the Toyota, Lexus and Daihatsu brands, said its global sales slid 0.6 percent in January-June to 4.992 million vehicles worldwide, down from 5.021 million in the same period last year.Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE said on Wednesday it delivered 5.116 million vehicles in the same period, a 1.5 percent rise.Having been the world's best-selling automaker for four consecutive years through 2015, Toyota 7203.T has suffered this year from a hit to Japanese production after an earthquake in April damaged a plant operated by a key supplier, halting production at many of its lines across the country for weeks. Before that, production at domestic assembly plants ground to a halt for a week in February after an explosion at one of the automaker’s steel suppliers led to a shortage of parts.For the month of June, sales of Toyota vehicles, which include the Camry and Corolla sedans and the gasoline hybrid Prius, fell 1.1 percent on the year to 881,000.VW’s sales have so far not taken a beating from its “dieselgate�� scandal, sparked by its admission in September that it installed illegal software to mask toxic emissions on about 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide.While sales of its mass-market VW brand have suffered, this has been more than offset by strong demand for luxury Audi and Porsche models as well as Czech brand Skoda.Europe’s largest automaker said on Thursday it expected full-year sales to come in slightly above last year’s 9.93 million deliveries, as demand in China and Western Europe outweighs declines in the Americas and Russia.Although the emissions scandal has tarnished its reputation and triggered a multitude of lawsuits, VW has maintained sales in part by offering incentives to buyers in the United States and other markets while it repositions its business by investing in electric cars and on-demand transport services.General Motors GM.N, the largest U.S. automaker, is third in global sales rankings, with six-month sales of 4.76 million vehicles, down 1.2 percent from a year earlier. 	7.831541219
* Q2 oper profit up 70 pct, full-year outlook unchanged* Japan demand strong for key Fit subcompact* Weak yen, strong U.S. sales seen boosting annual profit to 5-year high (Recasts to focus on Fit subcompact, adds currency impact)TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co is on track for its best annual profit in five years and a rosier longer-term future, boosted by the popularity of the new Fit subcompact which left the company struggling to keep up with demand.Japan’s third-largest automaker kept its operating profit target for the year to next March unchanged at 780 billion yen ($7.95 billion), up 43 percent from the year before, boosted by a weaker yen and strong sales in the United States, its biggest market.The maker of the Civic compact and Accord sedan said demand for the Fit, which is being positioned as a top-selling model worldwide and made its global sales debut in Japan in September, was stronger than expected and backlogs had emerged.“We are doing our best to speed up the Fit delivery dates but there is a limit to what the suppliers can supply and the capacity of our plants,�� Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told an earnings briefing.The Fit is essential to the company’s ambitious sales target of 6 million vehicles by end-March 2017, compared with a record 4.01 million in the last financial year, and it required heavy spending to expand or build new plants.For the July-September quarter, Honda posted an operating profit of $1.75 billion, or 171.4 billion yen, up from 100.8 billion yen a year ago. The result compared with the average estimate of 180.8 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of six analysts.Foreign exchange moves, largely the yen’s weakening against the dollar, boosted quarterly operating profit by 93.6 billion yen, although marketing costs and a rise in depreciation ate into that gain.The Japanese currency has weakened to around 98 yen against the dollar from 79 yen about year ago, boosting profits both from its export business and from the conversion of money made overseas back into the yen.Honda posted 13.1 percent sales growth in the United States, where it is the fifth biggest carmaker, helped by strong sales of the Accord and Civic.Globally, Honda kept its car sales forecast for the 2013/14 financial year at 4.43 million vehicles.Higher-than-expected demand for the Fit caught Honda’s parts suppliers by surprise. Honda has received 82,000 orders for the subcompact in a little over a month and the company has back orders for more than 60,000 vehicles, Iwamura said.Honda will begin operating a new plant in Mexico in the spring of 2014 to manufacture the Fit, with U.S. sales due to start around the same time.Iwamura said a region of concern for Honda was Thailand, where sales have slowed after an incentive programme for first-car buyers ended.Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co also saw sales drop in Thailand, Southeast Asia’s largest auto market, by more than one-fourth in the last quarter.Honda is the first of Japan’s big three automakers to announce quarterly results. Nissan, Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, said on Wednesday that it is moving its earnings date to Nov. 1 from Nov. 5, while market leader Toyota will announce on Nov. 6.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T U.S. executive Jim Lentz said consumers purchasing new vehicles to replace those lost during Superstorm Sandy will mean strong November U.S. auto sales.On a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, November U.S. sales will be between 14.8 million and 15.2 million new vehicles, said Lentz, president and chief executive of Toyota Motor Sales, USA.Lentz, speaking on the sidelines of a J.D. Power and Associates and National Automobile Dealers Association conference on Tuesday, said Toyota believes 400,000 cars and trucks were destroyed by Sandy, and that 100,000 of those were new vehicles.Sales will be robust in November throughout the United States, Lentz said, and particularly strong in the New York area where consumers are replacing cars destroyed by Sandy.John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda Motor Co, also at the conference, said he expects November sales at an annualized pace of “right around 15 million.”In November 2011, the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate was 13.5 million new vehicles, and last month was 14.3 million, according to TrueCar.com.TrueCar on Tuesday forecast U.S. November auto sales up 13 percent from a year ago, with a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.2 million new vehicles.Toyota’s sales will rise 17 percent from last November, TrueCar forecast.Honda Motor Co 7267.T November U.S. sales will rise the most among major automakers, at 32 percent, TrueCar said.TrueCar forecast November sales increases from year-ago levels for all major automakers in the U.S. market.Among the other top five automakers in the U.S. market, True Car said General Motors Co GM.N will show a rise of 9 percent; Ford Motor Co F.N 1.5 percent; and Chrysler Group LLC, majority owned by Fiat SpA FIA.MI, 18 percent.	8.17765245
TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp, Japan’s No.4 automaker, booked a record 80.4 billion yen ($813.60 million) in net profit for the year ended March, up 49.2 percent year-on-year, helped by record vehicle sales.Suzuki, the parent company of India’s biggest automaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, expects net profit to grow by 12 percent in the year ending March 2014 as the yen weakens against local currencies in key markets India and Indonesia.Suzuki, which ended its unprofitable U.S. car sales business last year, sold 2.66 million cars globally in the year ended March, up 3.9 percent from the previous year. It expects to sell 2.80 million cars in the year ending March 2013, up 5.4 percent.Its shares have risen 7 percent since early January, a modest gain compared with bigger rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, up 35 and 21 percent respectively.

SYDNEY, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Telstra Corp Ltd will cut up to 800 jobs as it restructures its directories unit Sensis into a digital business, Australia’s largest telecommunications provider said on Wednesday.“We need to remain responsive to the changing media landscape,�� Sensis managing director John Allan said in a statement. Telestra is trying to grow its digital presence and Sensis is facing stiff competition from mobile and online search directories.In January, Telstra agreed to sell 70 percent of Sensis to U.S.-based private equity firm Platinum Equity for A$454 million ($410 million), less than the market had expected.Telstra, which posted a 9.7 percent rise in first-half net profit last week, retains the remaining 30 percent of directories business. Sensis publishes print and online directories including the White Pages and the Yellow Pages.The job cuts at Sensis comes after data showed Australia’s jobless rate jumped to a decade high of 6 percent in January, which has intensified concerns about an already sluggish labour market as global car makers prepare to pull out of Australia.Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp announced last week it would stop manufacturing in Australia by 2017, following Ford and the Holden unit of General Motors.	-6.813053289
(This version of the story corrects company name to Volvo Car Group from Volvo AB in third paragraph)RUCKERSVILLE, Va. (Reuters) - A group of major automakers accounting for more than half of U.S. auto sales will make automatic emergency braking standard on new U.S. vehicles in one of the industry’s biggest auto safety moves since it embraced technology to prevent rollovers more than a decade ago.The car makers, which accounted for 57 percent of car and light truck sales in the United States last year, said Friday they will work with regulators and the insurance industry to roll out collision avoiding braking technology across their lineups over the next few years.The automakers are Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and its luxury car division Audi, BMW, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, Tesla Motors Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and Volvo Car Group.“We are entering a new era of vehicle safety, focused on preventing crashes from ever occurring,�� U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement Friday.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is overseeing the effort, said the collaborative agreement took shape over the last two weeks and that other car and truck manufacturers are still considering joining.Analysts say it could still take years for automakers to redesign the electrical and braking systems of their cars to install autonomous braking. Among the automotive technology suppliers that could benefit are Continental AG, Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], Delphi Automotive Plc, Denso Corp and Autoliv Inc.The agreement echoes earlier voluntary moves by big automakers. In the late 1980s, Chrysler began installing airbags in all its vehicles. In the 2000s, GM, Ford and others agreed to make anti-rollover technology standard on most sport utility vehicles. Stability control is now mandatory on light vehicles.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), a non-profit group affiliated with the insurance industry, has pushed automakers to install automatic emergency braking by making it a requirement for earning top marks in its influential crash test rankings.Federal officials say automatic braking can help avoid rear-end collisions, which accounted for one-third of all police-reported car crashes in 2013. Studies, including a recent IIHS report, also show that AEB technology can reduce insurance injury claims by as much as 35 percent.NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind told reporters Friday that AEB should become standard among the automakers faster than the seven to eight years it could take to develop mandatory regulations to deliver the technology to consumers.“It’s visible and the pressure’s on to make this happen fast,�� said Rosekind, who announced the agreement at an IIHS safety test facility 100 miles (160 km) from Washington in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. The NHTSA plans to make a series of new auto safety initiatives during the fall, he said.Only about 4 percent of cars built in North America will have automatic emergency braking, according to the business information firm IHS Inc. Toyota said earlier this year said that by the end of 2017 it would offer such systems in option packages for nearly all its models, with the technology packages ranging from $300 to about $500.	2.067355785

Toyota’s stakeholding in Subaru is the biggest of its investments in other Japanese automakers, and is the latest in a long history of stakeholdings which date back more than half a century:October 2005Toyota takes an 8.7% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI), currently known as Subaru, after General Motors Co GM.N sells its stake in FHI when the two automakers dissolve their strategic alliance and capital relationship. April 2008Toyota increases its stake in FHI to 16.5%. The two companies also decide to cooperate in research and development, developing a rear-wheel drive sports car, which becomes known as the Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRX. They also decide that Subaru will stop producing mini-cars for the Japanese market, and instead procure them from Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu.August 2017Toyota takes a 5% stake in Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T as the two companies announce they will work together on developing electric vehicles and build an assembly plant in the United States.

DETROIT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday its global sales grew 4 percent in 2013 on strong demand in the world’s two largest auto markets, China and the United States.Sales of the top U.S. automaker hit 9,714,652 cars and light trucks, an increase of more than 417,000 vehicles, as demand surged 11 percent to a record high in China and rose 7 percent in the United States.“A healthy auto market in the United States and China, and very successful product launches at all of our brands worldwide drove GM’s growth in 2013 and helped us navigate difficult conditions in Europe and parts of South America and Asia,�� GM Chief Financial Officer Dan Ammann said in a statement.Ammann will become GM’s president this week.German automaker Volkswagen AG said last week its sales rose 5 percent to more than 9.7 million vehicles, but did not provide details. The company’s results include its Scania and MAN brands.VW has pledged to surpass GM and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp to become the world’s largest automaker by 2018.Toyota, the largest automaker in terms of sales through the first nine months of 2013, will report full-year sales later this month.The Japanese automaker regained the global sales crown in 2012, after slipping to third place behind GM and Volkswagen in 2011, following natural disasters in Japan and Thailand. Previously, Toyota had been on top from 2008 through 2010.GM said its sales in Brazil inched up 1 percent and in the United Kingdom 11 percent. They fell 11 percent in Russia. Regionally, sales rose 7 percent in both North America and the company’s International Operations, which include China and the rest of Asia.Sales fell 3 percent in Europe and 1 percent in South America, GM said.Ammann said Sunday at the Detroit auto show that the European market had bottomed out, but it was unclear how fast it would rebound.GM’s Chevrolet brand saw sales rise slightly, while its Opel/Vauxhall brands in Europe were slightly down in the struggling region. However, the European brands gained market share for the first time in 14 years, the Detroit company said. Cadillac sales rose 28 percent and Buick was up 15 percent.	-3.599229932
LAS VEGAS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Automakers, not technology companies, are in the driver’s seat in developing self-driving, “autonomous�� cars, and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp is best positioned to lead the way, according to a new report on patents for the fast-evolving technology.As automakers enter agreements with Silicon Valley companies to develop self-driving cars, Tesla Motor Inc and Apple Inc would make logical partners, the report says.The report, by the Intellectual Property and Science division of Thomson Reuters, is based on a detailed analysis of patent filings by automakers and tech companies for autonomous-car technology. The findings illuminate the challenges for both established automakers and Silicon Valley companies as they compete to profit from moving people around in a world that is increasingly congested and concerned about carbon emissions.The global auto industry is in the midst of three simultaneous, and interconnected, technology revolutions. The first is the quest for cleaner alternatives to internal-combustion engines. The second involves connectivity and linking cars to information or data services. Lastly, the autonomy revolution is the effort to develop self-driving cars that could enable services in which electric cars connected to the Web can be summoned to provide rides on demand.“Automakers aren’t as good as technology companies in tooting their own horns,�� Tony Trippe, principal author of the report, told Reuters in an interview. “But when you look at the patent data, the automakers are all over this.”Toyota is, far and away, the global leader in the number of self-driving car patents, the report found. Toyota is followed by Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH, Japan’s Denso Corp , Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and General Motors Co. The tech company with the most autonomous-driving patents, Alphabet Inc’s Google, ranks 26th on the list.The report from the Thomson Reuters unit comes as auto and technology industry executives are gathering at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where alliances to advance autonomous driving and connected vehicles will be central topics.GM said on Monday it will invest $500 million in Lyft Inc as it forges a Detroit-Silicon Valley partnership with the ride-sharing service to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars.Toyota, the Thomson Reuters report found, has more than 1,400 patents on autonomous-driving devices, more than twice as many as any other company. One recent Toyota patent application, for example, is for software that avoids a car’s self-driving system being switched off, and thus defaulting to “manual mode�� in which the driver controls the car, unless the driver intends to turn off the system.The raw number of patents does not necessarily equate to leadership in developing self-driving cars, Trippe said. Non-U.S. companies tend to be more aggressive in filing patent applications than American companies. The quality of patents is also important, since not all are created equal.Another potential limitation of the report is the 18-month lag time between patent filings and when the filings are published for the public.In reality, driverless-car development will require alliances between automakers and technology companies, even though both sides will try to gain the upper hand in partnerships.A Toyota spokesman said the automaker views a fully self-driving car as a long term goal, but one that must wait for autonomous driving systems that never make a mistake. In the meantime, Toyota is accelerating efforts to equip cars with automatic braking and other safety systems that can help avoid crashes.Most experts say fully self-driving vehicles are unlikely to be roaming roads in large numbers for many years yet. Google has been testing self-driving cars since 2009, though, and automakers such as Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit have revealed cars that can travel long distances without human intervention.Trippe said Apple and Tesla would make logical partners in autonomous cars because they have complementary, not duplicative patents. Tesla’s strength is propulsion technology, notably batteries, while Apple’s is in electronic navigation and communication systems.As the race to develop self-driving cars heats up, automakers are also introducing more “semi-autonomous�� driving systems that handle tedious or tricky situations. Audi, for instance, is expected to use the CES show to outline progress on a system that allows cars to pilot themselves in traffic jams at low speeds.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (Reuters) - Two executives at Japan’s Denso Corp have agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix prices of electronic auto parts sold to Toyota and will cooperate with an ongoing criminal investigation, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.The settlement is the latest in a wide-ranging investigation into price fixing for a variety of car parts that has ensnared nine companies and elicited guilty pleas from 14 executives.The Denso executives, Yuji Suzuki and Hiroshi Watanabe, both Japanese nationals, will serve time in U.S. prison and pay a criminal fine, the department said. Suzuki agreed to serve a 16-month sentence while Watanabe negotiated 15 months.Denso itself pleaded guilty in the conspiracy and agreed to pay a $78 million fine last year.The two men agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix the prices of heater control panels that regulate a car’s temperature and were sold to Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and a U.S. subsidiary, the Justice Department said.Suzuki also agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix the prices of electronic control units, which regulate power windows, power locks and other electrical systems.In addition to the prison sentence, each man must also pay a fine of $20,000 and cooperate with the ongoing investigation.The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division has also settled with Autoliv, Tokai Rika Co Ltd, TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, Nippon Seiki Col Ltd, Fujikura Ltd , Furukawa Electric Co Ltd, Yazaki Corp and G.S. Electech.The European Commission has a parallel investigation under way.	-6.484668335
James Harden returned from a seven-game injury hiatus but took a backseat to the dynamic play of Chris Paul and Eric Gordon in the Houston Rockets�� 116-98 victory over the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday at Toyota Center.Harden, playing under a minutes restriction, finished with 10 points on 3-of-15 shooting and seven assists over 26 minutes, the first time this season he failed to record at least 20 points.Gordon and Paul filled the scoring void. Gordon posted 30 points off the bench, drilling 7 of 13 3-point attempts. Paul tallied 19 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Paul hit 4 of 8 long-distance attempts as Houston finished 17 of 39 from behind the arc to repeatedly turn back Timberwolves rallies.Jimmy Butler and Karl-Anthony Towns worked in tandem to keep Minnesota close, with Butler pouring in 23 points as Towns added a double-double of 22 points and 16 rebounds. Andrew Wiggins chipped in a relatively quiet 16 points, and Tyus Jones added 13 points off the Timberwolves�� bench.Following a sluggish start, the Rockets created separation with a Gordon-paced flurry to close the first period. Gordon tallied nine points in succession, following a three-point play with back-to-back 3-pointers to give the Rockets a 26-17 lead entering the second period. The Rockets pulled the same trick to close the half, with Paul spearheading a 13-5 rally to finish that frame.Paul sank a pair of 3-pointers during that stretch and assisted on a transition trey from Gordon that extended the lead to 60-47 with just under a minute remaining in the half. Paul also converted a baseline fadeaway over Towns, winning that isolation battle with some deft ballhandling.After the Timberwolves clawed to within seven late in the third quarter, the Rockets reeled off a 16-4 blitz to close the period and take an 89-70 lead into the fourth. Gordon hit a half-court buzzer-beater for the final bit of theatrics, leaving Minnesota a hole too deep to escape.Houston has won 15 of its past 17 games against the Timberwolves, including 10 in a row at Toyota Center.--Field Level Media	-2.860207365
Oct 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it would recall more than 7.4 million vehicles worldwide as a faulty power window switch was a potential fire hazard, the latest in a series of setbacks for Japan’s biggest automaker.Toyota has battled its way back from multiple difficulties since 2008, including a series of recalls involving more than 10 million of its vehicles in 2009-11, and supply chains crippled by the tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand.Below are details of some other recent major recalls.March 2012 - BMW says it is recalling about 1.3 million cars for repair worldwide due to a possible problem with a battery cable cover in the trunk. The recall affects 5- and 6-Series BMWs built between 2003 and 2010.September 2011 - Honda says it will recall about 960,000 Fit subcompacts and other models globally to repair defects including malfunctioning power window switches.May 2011 - Honda expands earlier recalls of Honda and Acura vehicles over airbags that could deploy with too much pressure, causing injuries or fatalities, adding more than 833,000 vehicles from model years 2001-2003. This is the fourth time Honda has widened its airbag recall, first announced in 2008. The number of vehicles affected is now 1.65 million.January 2011 - Toyota says it will recall more than 1.7 million vehicles worldwide, bringing its total for recalls to nearly 16 million since late 2009 and dealing a blow to its efforts to restore its reputation for quality.October 2010 - Toyota will recall a total of about 1.66 million vehicles, mostly in Japan, the United States and China, for problems involving brakes and fuel pumps.October 2010 - BMW voluntarily recalls 350,000 cars worldwide due to possible brake problems. The problem affects brand 5, 6 and 7 Series models built since 2002.August 2010 - Toyota recalls 1.3 million Corolla and Matrix cars from 2005-2008 model years in the United States and Canada.June 2010 - GM announces the recall of 1.5 million trucks, crossovers and cars from model years 2006-2009 as the unit that heats the windshield washer fluid could catch fire.March 2010 - GM says it is recalling 1.3 million compact cars covering the 2005-2010 model year Chevrolet Cobalt and 2007-2010 Pontiac G5 in the U.S.; the 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada; and the 2005-2006 Pontiac G4 sold in Mexico.January 2010 - Toyota issues a series of recalls covering 5.6 million vehicles in the United States due to sudden acceleration in some vehicles.	3.80761523
(Reuters) - A Frenchman called Sebastien has won every world rally championship since 2004 but Toyota’s Ott Tanak could end that 15-year sequence in Spain on Sunday.Sebastien Loeb won nine titles in a row between 2004 and 2012 before Sebastien Ogier took over and continued the run with six more in succession.Estonian Tanak ended Saturday’s penultimate stage of the Rally of Spain in third place, 24.6 seconds behind Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville and 3.1 adrift of the Belgian’s local team mate Dani Sordo.Loeb, also driving a Hyundai, was fourth and a mere 0.6 seconds behind Tanak. Citroen’s Ogier was in a distant eighth place.Four asphalt stages, totaling 74.14km, will be held on Sunday near Salou, on the Catalan coast to the south-west of Tarragona.As things stand, Tanak can secure his first title with a round to spare if he also banks bonus points from the closing power stage.At present he is 28 points ahead of Ogier and 41 ahead of Neuville, who needs to score 12 more than the Estonian to take the fight down to Australia.“Tanak has been fast and we were always going to see a spirited reaction from him as he tries to clinch the drivers�� title,�� said Hyundai team boss Andrea Adamok.“We can only focus on our job, and our crews have done everything they can.��	2.623969929
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Subaru Corp 7270.T set a target on Monday to sell only electric vehicles worldwide by the first half of the 2030s, in a move toward its long-term goal of a carbon-free society.The news comes as Subaru has strengthened capital ties with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, in a trend of global automakers joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. To supplement the mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars already in its lineup, Subaru plans to develop a so-called “strong hybrid�� vehicle using Toyota technology and intended to debut later in the decade.It is also developing an all-battery electric car with Toyota for release around the same time.“Although we’re using Toyota technology, we want to make hybrids that are distinctly Subaru,�� Chief Technology Officer Tetsuo Onuki told a briefing.“It’s not only about reducing CO2 emissions. We need to further improve vehicle safety and the performance of our all-wheel drive.”Subaru said that by 2030 at least 40% of its cars sold worldwide will comprise battery electric vehicles or hybrids.The Japanese automaker, which produces the Outback and Forester SUVs, is known for its horizontally placed boxer engines, along with its EyeSight autonomous driver assist and all-wheel-drive technologies.Car manufacturers worldwide are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development of the self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services that are upending the industry.“Subaru’s strong commitment and dedication toward car-manufacturing that we have cultivated throughout our history remain unchanged,�� President Tomomi Nakamura added.	-3.188650091
DETROIT, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz will not be the top-selling luxury nameplate this year, although the brand still expects to report record U.S. sales surpassing 270,000, Steve Cannon, head of the brand’s U.S. operations, said on Thursday.Mercedes and its German rival BMW have been in a tight race all year for the top spot. Mercedes has sold about 246,000 vehicles through November of this year, slightly ahead of BMW, which has sold about 244,000 vehicles.“I don’t think we’re going to win the sales race this year,�� Steve Cannon, president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz USA, told reporters during a luncheon in Detroit.Cannon, who was promoted to his position a year ago, added that there was “no pressure�� from top executives in Germany to reach the top spot in the competitive U.S. luxury market.BMW was the best-selling luxury brand in the United States last year, ending the 11-year reign of Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand, which had been hurt by vehicle shortages after the earthquake in Japan last March.

TOKYO, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co will start selling its new small hatchback Brio Satya in November in Indonesia where it expects the vehicle to be certified by the government as a tax-exempt, low-cost green car.Japanese carmakers including Honda are banking on Indonesia’s long delayed Low Cost Green Car (LCGC) programme to boost sales. Under the plan, no luxury tax would be imposed on cars or station wagons with an engine displacement of up to 1,200ccs, or diesel or semi-diesel vehicles of up to 1,500ccs and with fuel consumption of 20 kilometres per litre or better.Honda, the fifth-biggest carmaker in the fast-growing market, expects the government to certify its made-in-Indonesia, 1,200cc Brio Satya as an LCGC by the end of October, a spokesman said. The Brio Satya will have a starting price of 106 million rupiah ($9,400), Honda said on Wednesday.This week, Toyota Motor Co and group company Daihatsu Motor Co, which together hold a 50 percent market share, became the first to obtain the LCGC certification with their compact cars - sister models called Toyota Agya and Daihatsu Ayla.The Toyota group expects LCGC cars to account for 10 percent of Indonesia’s total automobile demand. In 2012, Indonesian auto sales hit a record 1.1 million and some estimates show it could double over the next three years.Honda, the biggest motorbike maker in Indonesia, holds a 7 percent share in the car market, lagging the Toyota group as well as Mitsubishi Motors Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp , which each hold around a 13 percent share.Honda will open a new auto plant in Indonesia in 2014 and will more than double its annual car production capacity to 200,000 vehicles.	3.844015567
HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE sought to dampen expectations on Tuesday that it would soon list its truck unit Traton on the stock market, saying no final decision had been taken.Volkswagen has taken steps to prepare Traton for a possible initial public offering, and a floatation would allow the unit to tap capital markets to help it build a global trucks business and challenge rivals Daimler DAIGn.DE and Volvo VOLVb.ST.Traton Chief Executive Andreas Renschler downplayed expectations that it could soon list the business, telling journalists at the IAA truck fair in Hanover that all options remained open and the company would decide in due time.“An initial public offering is just one option of many,�� he said.Volkswagen said on Monday the carmaker’s supervisory board had decided to convert Traton’s legal structure to a Societas Europaea (SE) and to shortly mandate investment banks and legal advisors for a possible IPO.When asked about possible acquisitions, Renschler said all options remained open but said it had no plans to increase its stake in U.S. truck maker Navistar NAV.N, in which it already owns a 16.85 percent.Earlier on Tuesday, Traton said it would form a joint venture between its MAN brand and Sinotruk, part of China's CNHTC Group 000951.SZ, to develop a heavy-duty truck for the Chinese market. It has also announced a joint venture with Toyota’s truck-making arm Hino Motors Ltd &lt;7205. T&gt; for procurement and said the two firms would co-operate in e-mobility to speed up the development of new vehicles.	-7.181615065
BEIJING, May 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its China joint ventures sold 76,400 cars in the country in April, down 6.5 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Monday.That compares a 11.7 percent year-on-year fall in March.Toyota, which operates car ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd , aims to sell 900,000 cars in the country this year, up 7.1 percent from a year earlier.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Days before a group of Republican lawmakers were due to discuss their party's controversial proposal to tax all imports, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T sent an urgent message to its U.S. dealers - tell the politicians the tax would seriously hurt car buyers.Some of Toyota’s 1,500 dealers heeded the call and contacted members of the House of Representatives�� tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, urging them to rethink their proposal, according to people familiar with the effort.Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would force consumers to pay potentially thousands of dollars more for vehicles, they warned.The Japanese automaker’s mobilization of its army of dealers underscores the growing alarm among some of the world’s largest companies that sell imported goods in the United States. They fear a big tax on imports would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products.“Cost is going to go up, as a result demand is going to go down. As a result, we’re not going to able to employ as many as people as we do today. That’s my biggest fear,�� Toyota’s North America CEO Jim Lentz said in an interview.Toyota dealers employ more than 97,000 people in the United States.While companies and industry groups frequently lobby Congress, the threat of an import tax has mobilized an unusually broad swath of firms at home and abroad. That lobbying effort is taking place largely out of the public eye partly to avoid potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who has attacked companies for manufacturing abroad for U.S. consumers.Earlier this month Trump targeted Toyota, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world’s largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico.The White House said last week that a border tax is one option under review to pay for a wall with Mexico, although what exactly Trump is planning to do is still not clear. He has pledged to impose a “big border tax�� on Mexican imports.The plan proposed by House Republicans would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose the 20 percent tax on imports.Companies that rely heavily on imports say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax.As car dealers are reaching out to members of Congress in their districts, Toyota and other automakers are lobbying lawmakers in states where they have large manufacturing plants and employ thousands of workers.The No. 3 vehicle seller in the United States behind General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N, Toyota imports about 1.2 million vehicles to the U.S. market annually, half of its 2.4 million U.S. sales. It employs 40,000 people directly.Toyota and the automakers are not alone in this lobbying effort.Target Corp's TGT.N chief executive, Brian Cornell, traveled to Washington to meet members of the House Ways and Means Committee. He told them an import tax could impact consumers' ability to buy essential goods, such as baby supplies that are made overseas and imported to the United States, according to a person familiar with the talks. Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins confirmed the visit.The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy BBY.N, headquartered down the road from Minneapolis-based Target, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers. It cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss.The flyer, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, argues that foreign Internet sellers like China’s Alibaba.com would be able to avoid the tax by making sales online and shipping to U.S. consumers directly, “undercutting U.S. businesses.”Company officials have been handing out the flyer to lawmakers and their staff on Capitol Hill, Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman confirmed.Constellation Brands STZ.N, which brews Corona and Modelo in Mexico, has been pushing lawmakers to exempt products like Mexican beer in any border tax “because it’s inherently a Mexican product,"" CEO Rob Sands said on an earnings call. But if that effort fails, Constellation is prepared to buy more raw materials from the United States instead of Mexico, Sands said.Koch Industries [KCHIN.UL], the second-largest private U.S. company according to Forbes, said in a statement a border tax would have a “devastating�� impact on consumers. The company, owned by Republican donors Charles and David Koch, includes oil refining and manufacturing interests.Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political group founded by the billionaire brothers, told Reuters the powerful group has started to educate its network of activists about the tax, so they can lobby against it. AFP says it has two million activists.Not everyone in corporate America is worried about a new border tax.Several aerospace companies including Boeing Co BA.N, United Technologies Corp UTX.N and Raytheon Co RTN.N said in earnings calls last week that a border tax could be positive for net exporters like them. “We see the aerospace sector as fundamentally having an advantage in that regard,�� Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said.The American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA), however, called the proposal ""heart stopping,"" in a letter last week to 9,500 dealers selling vehicles like Toyota, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, and BMW BMWG.DE.Opponents of the border tax may have already found some allies.Republican Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, where BMW has a large plant, said the importance of foreign automakers such as BMW and Toyota to the economy needs to be considered when making laws.“I cannot overstate how significant that industry is to my state,�� Gowdy said in an interview, adding that he and his wife both drive Toyotas."	-2.03887689
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An SUV smashed through a glass storefront on New York’s Long Island on Monday, killing a woman inside the shop and injuring two others, Nassau County Police said.The driver of the 2006 Toyota Rav4, which careened into an AT&amp;T store at a strip mall in Great Neck at 10:51 a.m., was unhurt.“The car went to pull into a parking spot and continued into the store,�� said a Nassau County Police spokeswoman.A 66-year-old woman inside the store suffered extensive injuries and was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 1 p.m., police said.Two others in the shop suffered non-life-threatening injuries.Police said the driver tested negative for alcohol or drugs, and an investigation was continuing.No further details were available.	-0.6219172207
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), a Tesla supplier, is developing a new type of electric vehicle (EV) battery that contains no nickel or cobalt, a company executive said on Saturday.Nickel and cobalt are key ingredients in the batteries that power EVs. Battery makers from Japan’s Panasonic Corp to South Korea’s LG Chem are lowering the use of expensive cobalt in their nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) batteries or nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries.Tesla’s boss, Elon Musk, last month urged miners to produce more nickel, warning the current cost of batteries remained a big hurdle to the company’s growth.Ningde-based CATL makes NCM batteries and supplies lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to Tesla. It has partnerships with Japan's Toyota Motor and Honda Motor and supplies Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Daimler AG.The new battery type will be different from existing NCA, NCM and LFP batteries and will have no expensive metals like nickel or cobalt, Meng Xiangfeng, a senior executive at CATL, told an industry conference held by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers in Shanghai.Meng did not give details of the makeup or the cost of the planned battery type.CATL is also developing a separate technology to integrate battery cells directly into an EV’s frame to extend its driving range.	-1.10676603
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota-backed self driving company Pony.ai said on Friday it would provide an autonomous delivery service to residents of Irvine, California, as demand for online orders surges because of the coronavirus lockdown.As some 90% of U.S. shoppers are under stay-at-home orders, a jump in demand for package and grocery delivery has left e-commerce platforms struggling to cope.In response, Amazon has said it plans to hire 75,000 more people for jobs ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers.Pony.ai said in a statement it would use autonomous electric vehicles to deliver packages from local e-commerce platform Yamibuy to customers in Irvine, California, which has a population of more than 200,000.The autonomous fleet comprises 10 electric Kona sport-utility vehicles, made by Hyundai and its deliveries will mark Pony.ai’s first attempt to deliver goods, rather than transport passengers.As part of efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, self-driving technology companies, including Alphabet Inc unit Waymo, General Motors Co unit Cruise and Uber, have suspended autonomous car testing that involves back-up drivers.Pony.ai said in March it would pause its public robotaxi service in Fremont, also California, and Irvine for three weeks.The company is testing cars in the Chinese cities of Beijing and Guangzhou and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) eased regulation on autonomous delivery service last year.The DMV said at the time it would allow the testing and commercial use of light-duty autonomous delivery vehicles on California’s public roads with certain permission.Pony.ai, founded in 2016, raised $462 million in its latest funding round in February, led by an investment by Japan’s largest automaker Toyota. It is also backed by Sequoia Capital China and Beijing Kunlun Tech Co.	-4.124869593
(Adds background on former officials working for Takata)DETROIT/WASHINGTON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Takata Corp has recruited three former U.S. transportation secretaries to help the Japanese parts supplier navigate a growing auto safety crisis associated with millions of its airbags, the company announced on Tuesday.Samuel K. Skinner, a former White House Chief of Staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary, will lead an independent quality panel while two other former U.S. transportation secretaries, Rodney Slater and Norman Mineta, will advise Takata as it struggles to handle a series of recalls.The move to bring in Washington heavy hitters shows a new aggressiveness by Takata in trying to contain the scandal involving potentially defective air bags that can rupture upon deployment, spraying metal shards at the vehicle’s occupants.At least five deaths have been linked to the scandal. Takata is also facing a criminal probe, more than 20 class action lawsuits, congressional scrutiny, and an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The move also put a fresh spotlight on the revolving door that has frequently spun between the auto industry and its regulators.A Takata U.S. spokesman did not respond to a question concerning how the former transportation secretaries would be paid.In announcing the former officials�� retention, Chief Executive Officer Shigehisa Takada said the company wanted to show the public and its regulators that it will not rest until it has resolved the air bag performance issues.He said the panel helmed by Skinner will produce an independent report on its manufacuturing processes that will be made public. He also said his company would take “dramatic actions�� to increase output of the replacement air bag inflators kits. That includes working with rivals and examining whether their products can be used safely, he said.“I know we can and must do more,�� he said in a Tuesday statement.Since leaving office, the former transportation secretaries now working with Takata have booked decades of experience advising corporate clients - often companies facing a reputational crisis.When Toyota was embroiled in a safety scandal about a faulty accelerator several years ago, Slater, who served President Bill Clinton, led a company-funded panel to examine how the company handled the crisis.The 2011 Slater report faulted the Japanese automaker for a culture skeptical of safety concerns, though it offered no opinion on possible mechanical faults. Toyota ultimately paid $1.2 billion to settle a criminal probe into whether it misled consumers about the deadly flaw.Mineta, who succeeded Slater as President George W. Bush’s first Transportation Secretary, was an executive with public relations firm Hill+Knowlton Strategies for more than six years after leaving office in 2006.Skinner has served on many corporate boards since leaving public life.Skinner and Slater, through representatives, declined comment. Mineta was not immediately available for comment.The auto industry and its regulators have been frequently criticized for an overly cozy relationship, but little has been done to formally crack down on the revolving door. Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer in 2010 introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have restricted such movements between NHTSA and automakersClarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said automakers have every right to try and boost their image with prominent consultants, but outsiders can see the tactic for what it is.“The bigger the crisis, the bigger the personalities,�� he said. “Toyota needed one former Transporation Secretary. Takata tripled-down on that.”Takata’s announcement comes ahead of a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on Wednesday that will feature executives from Takata and automakers, as well as NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman.The hearing will likely focus on whether Takata will heed NHTSA’s call for it to expand its largely regional recall of driver-side air bags to all 50 states.Hiroshi Shimizu, Takata’s senior vice president for global quality assurance, said in prepared remarks that a phased-in recall should give priority to U.S. regions with higher humidity - believed to be a factor in some air bag ruptures.NHTSA had given Takata until Tuesday to declare that its air bag inflators were defective and issue a national recall. The Nikkei reported on Tuesday that Takata was preparing to comply, but the prepared testimony did not address the issue, and the company did not respond to a request for comment.Honda North American Executive Vice President Rick Schostek said in his testimony that a national recall would lead to parts shortages, but the Japanese automaker was “seriously considering�� it for the driver-side air bag inflators.Toyota North American vice president Abbas Saadat said in his testimony that the automaker wanted “additional assurances about the integrity and quality of Takata’s manufacturing processes.�� Toyota and Honda called on Tuesday for independent industrywide tests of Takata air bag inflators subject to recalls.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government helped to secure a more than 240-million ($310 million) pound investment from Toyota in its English plant with a letter reassuring the Japanese carmaker over post-Brexit trading arrangements, two sources told Reuters.Toyota said on March 16 it would install its new car platform at its Burnaston plant. One source, who is familiar with the letter, said that Toyota delayed the decision due by the end of December while it weighed up a number of factors including Brexit.The business ministry has confirmed the existence of a letter but refused to release it.The source said the letter was similar to one sent to Japanese carmaker Nissan last year when it decided to build two new models at its northern English plant. The document sparked public and lawmaker concern about secretive deals.The source, who did not say when the letter was sent, said it contained several reassurances.“They received a similar set of warm words as Nissan on electric vehicles, commitment to further training and to ensure the competitiveness of the UK automotive industry,�� the source said.A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on whether it had received such a letter. He referred to the company’s March 16 statement which said the British government was providing funding for training and research and development. Toyota also said at the time that “continued tariff-and-barrier free market access... will be vital for future success.”Britain said in March it would back up the investment from Toyota, which builds roughly 10 percent of Britain’s 1.7 million cars, by spending 21.3 million pounds to support skills and training, research and development and innovation, subject to an independent assessment.A spokesman at the business ministry declined to provide any comment for this story. Business minister Greg Clark said last year that assurances offered to Nissan were available to other firms.Reuters made a freedom of information (FOI) request to the business ministry to see documentation relating to the investment decision, which the ministry said included a letter.In its response, an official at the ministry refused to release the letter and a company briefing note, saying the information was “both highly commercially sensitive�� and “would be likely to cause harm to the company’s commercial interests if disclosed.”Clark has refused to publish the Nissan letter. He said he will release the information when it is no longer commercially confidential.Many of the world’s biggest car firms are worried about the long-term viability of their British plants and are using their upcoming investment decisions to push for promises to maintain free trade after Britain’s exit from the EU, which is due to take place in March 2019.Toyota finalised its decision at a meeting between its Europe President and Chief Executive Johan van Zyl and Clark on March 15, the day before the official announcement, a third source, who is close to the company told Reuters.In response to the FOI request, the business ministry said there were three documents relating to discussions between the firm and top government officials since Clark was appointed in July last year: a letter, a confidential company briefing and an email exchange.It initially refused to publish all three but after Reuters appealed the decision, the department released a redacted email exchange. Reuters asked for correspondence between the company and Clark, a special advisor, a junior minister and the ministry’s automotive team.The email exchange included three messages which were written after a meeting between Clark and van Zyl. The emails are redacted so that it is not possible to know who received them.“We picked up from the recent meeting with Greg Clark that Toyota has a significant investment decision coming up before the end of the year, for a new European ‘architecture plant��,�� according to official correspondence dated Sep. 9.“Dr Zyl noted that uncertainties over future trade arrangements are a worry, and SofS (Secretary of State Clark) sought to reassure on the alignment of company and HMG (Her Majesty’s government) goals.”�It would (be) great to understand more about the decision, and if there are any ways in which HMG could help,�� the email from the official said.Clark had meetings with Toyota officials in September, November and March, according to an official government log.Japan’s Nissan, Toyota and Honda account for around half of British car output. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with British Prime Minister Theresa May in April and called for a smooth Brexit to allow Japanese firms to continue to operate.Toyota has yet to say which models it will build in Burnaston over the next decade.	2.447203843

DETROIT (Reuters) - The Chevrolet Spark all-electric subcompact car will cost U.S. buyers as much as 38 percent less than what it takes to buy its larger sibling, the hybrid Volt, General Motors Co said on Thursday.The 2014 Spark EV, which goes on sale next month in California and Oregon, will sell for as low as $19,995 after accounting for the full federal tax credit of $7,500, GM said. The larger Chevy Volt, which was introduced in the fall of 2010, sells for about $32,500 after the tax credit.“The Chevrolet Spark EV is the most efficient - and now one of the most affordable - EVs you can buy,�� Chris Perry, GM’s vice president of Chevrolet marketing, said in a statement.GM has made rolling out cars with electrical technology -- including its eAssist system that boosts fuel efficiency in gasoline-powered cars -- as a central part of its global strategy.The U.S. automaker is aiming by 2017 to build up to 500,000 vehicles a year that include some form of electric engine power, including cars like the Spark EV, the Volt and those with eAssist. GM will begin building the Cadillac ELR plug-in electric coupe late this year.The rollout of the Spark EV continues GM’s push to seize the mantle of “greenest automaker in the world�� from Toyota Motor Corp., which makes the popular Prius hybrid car. Toyota also sells a plug-in version of the Prius.California Spark EV owners also could qualify for an additional $2,500 in state tax credits and incentives, GM said. The car will lease for as low as $199 a month for 36 months with $999 due at signing.GM previously said the Spark EV will be able to travel twice as far on an electric charge as the plug-in hybrid Volt can go before its gas engine kicks in.The Spark EV has a combined city/highway range of 82 miles when fully charged as estimated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Volt gets about 40 miles on an electric charge. The Spark EV’s fuel economy is equivalent to 119 miles per gallon on an EPA-estimated combined city/highway basis.	-6.52173913
BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said on Wednesday it will start testing autonomous vehicles in China's eastern city of Hefei, its first in the world's biggest car market.China has become a hot spot for trying out autonomous driving vehicles. Toyota-backed 7203.T Pony.ai, Baidu Inc BIDU.O, Nissan-backed 7201.T WeRide and Didi Chuxing are all testing autonomous cars in different cities as automakers and tech companies are investing billions in the technology.Volkswagen, the biggest foreign automaker in China, will start the test in Hefei with Audi’s e-tron electric sport utility vehicles from September, it said in a statement. The test will be open to the public from next year.In May, Volkswagen said it would invest 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) to take a 50% stake in the state-owned parent of Chinese electronic vehicle group JAC. Volkswagen will also take full management control of its existing electric vehicle joint venture with JAC in Hefei by raising its stake to 75% from 50%.Volkswagen also has ventures with state-owned China FAW Group Corp Ltd [SASACJ.UL] and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS.The German car company sold 1.59 million vehicles in China in the first six months of 2020, down 17% from 1.92 million vehicles in the same period last year. For all of 2019, Volkswagen sold around 4.23 million vehicles in the country.In June Volkswagen closed its $2.6 billion investment in Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup Argo AI, in which Ford Motor Co F.N also has a stake.($1 = 0.8465 euros)	1.834381551
TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday forecast a 4.2 percent slide in operating profit for the current financial year, as it expects a stronger yen to offset slightly higher global vehicle sales and cost reductions.Japan’s biggest automaker expects operating profit to ease to 2.3 trillion yen (convert) in the year to March 2019, slightly higher than a median forecast for 2.19 trillion yen from 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Operating profit was 2.4 trillion yen in the year ended March.Toyota’s forecast is based on the assumption that the yen will trade around 105 yen to the U.S. dollar in the current financial year, compared with 111 yen in the year just ended.A stronger local currency can dent profits repatriated from overseas and raise the cost of finished products and parts when they are shipped between countries.

LONDON (Reuters) -The coronavirus continues to claim lives, yet the impact on global demand and companies is just starting to be felt. Recent days have seen an unremitting flow of dire headlines as supply chains from New Zealand to the United States felt the impact of a paralyzed China.Toyota and Honda are suspending production in China, Hyundai has halted work in South Korea, airlines are grounding flights and reducing staff, and central banks are easing policy.China’s 2020 growth estimates have been slashed as much as a percentage point from the 6% initially expected. Some factories could reopen in the coming days, while others are expected to stay shut for now.Some financial markets were quick to recover: Wall Street climbed to records, encouraged by earnings and economic data. Chinese stocks, which lost $700 billion of market value on reopening after Lunar New Year holidays, have now clawed back half those losses. Yet commodity prices such as copper and oil, seen by many as a better signal for the real economy, still have some way to recover.Investors waiting to get a readout of the economic toll may have to be a bit more patient. Inflation and monetary indicators in China are scheduled for release over the coming days, the latter expected to show some effects of the central bank’s efforts to support suffering firms.But retail sales and industrial activity will only be published in March, while trade data due out for release on Feb. 7 has been postponed.(Graphic: China GDP by province, )2/”DON’T FEAR THE REPO”That, in all likelihood, will be one of the main messages Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell seeks to deliver to U.S. lawmakers in two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. Given Powell and his Fed crew have been consistent in recent messaging that there is no hurry to resume rate cuts (or hikes) and that they see the economy in “a good place�� one topic that might generate fireworks in his appearances on Tuesday and Wednesday is “repo��.A band of Democrats from the Senate Banking Committee, where Powell heads on Wednesday, has already sent him a list of questions about last autumn’s upheaval in the repurchase agreement market, where banks go to secure funding to meet their reserve requirements. The episode �� when a cash squeeze drove overnight repo interest rates to 10% - forced the Fed back into the active bond-buying business for the first time in some five years and it scooped up more than $300 billion of T-bills since.The Fed has also become the lender of first resort in the repo market, pumping tens of billions of dollars each day into money markets to ensure liquidity and avoid another squeeze.Policy-makers believe the repo riot was triggered by having allowed bank reserve levels to fall too low in the roughly two years it had been letting the stash of bonds on its balance sheet dwindle. Reserves are on the upswing again, but just where the sweet spot in reserve levels lies is the big unknown, and Powell will be pressed for answers.(Graphic: Bank reserves held at the Fed, )European stock markets have already put in a stellar performance in 2020 with many indexes hitting record highs in recent days. With the results season underway, Stoxx 600 companies are seen reporting 1.2% earnings growth in the fourth quarter, according to IBES Refinitiv, marking the end of a nine-month corporate recession in Europe.Now it is time to see if GDP readings due out provide any hints of those “green shoots�� detected in the recent European PMI readings, which spurred hopes that a long slump in the region’s manufacturing sector could also be bottoming out.In Britain, recent PMI readings showed a post-election economy bounce in January as services companies enjoyed the strongest influx of new orders since mid-2018. December GDP data, due on Tuesday, is expected to come in at 0.8% in Q4 year-on-year after 1.1% in Q3.On the continent, flash data out on Friday is expected to show that year-on-year GDP growth across the bloc remained at 1.0% in the fourth quarter, while expansion in Germany is predicted to cool to 0.4% year-in-year from 0.5% in Q3.Though with potential supply chain disruptions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, there could be some new headaches waiting just around the corner.(Graphic: Global manufacturing PMI, )The end of the week will see a flurry of filings from investment firms as the deadline for 13F forms for the quarterly period ending Dec. 31 falls on Feb. 14. Investment firms that hold more than $100 million in securities are required to file and disclose their holdings in equity securities and other products, according to the SEC website.One of the hot stocks to watch out for is electric vehicle maker Tesla, which has seen a spectacular rally of nearly 80% this year. Tesla has been revving up markets as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s vision, and on the future for electric vehicles.So who’s on and who’s off the big Tesla rollercoaster? Up to now, the biggest institutional shareholders are Baillie Gifford, Capital World and Vanguard, while its top three hedge fund investors are Renaissance Technologies, Gilder Gagnon Howe &amp; Co and Citadel, according to Refinitiv data. One seller in the quarter was Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund, according to a recent filing.(Graphic: Tesla's largest shareholders, )(Graphic: Tesla's largest hedge fund investors, )A clutch of central banks are set to meet in days to come as the death toll from the deadly virus outbreak has crossed the 600 mark while analysts are still counting the costs to the global economy.While major global central banks including the Fed and the Reserve Bank of Australia have warned of a significant hit from the virus to economic output in recent days, they have stopped short of loosening monetary policy outright.But not so their emerging market counterparts. Both Philippines and Thailand cut interest rates unexpectedly this week while Singapore, which controls policy via its currency, said its local dollar has more room to weaken.Emerging market central banks have more reason to fear the impact of the dreaded virus. China now accounts for a third of global growth compared to only 10% during the SARS epidemic, and the economies with the strongest trade ties with Beijing are feeling the heat.With multiple channels of exposure including trade, tourism and services, central banks from Sweden to Indonesia will have plenty of food for thought when policy-makers meet in the coming weeks.(Graphic: EM central banks are in easing mode, )	-13.08748584

* Adds Toyota President’s salary, Renault background (Adds Toyota President Akio Toyoda’s salary and Ghosn’s compensation from Renault)YOKOHAMA, Japan, June 24 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, one of the highest-compensated executives in Japan, said he was paid 995 million yen ($9.8 million) in the financial year that ended in March, up 0.7 percent from the previous year.The slight rise in Ghosn’s pay, which excluded stock options, came as profitability in Nissan is being squeezed by the cost of a rapid expansion drive.Japan’s second-biggest auto maker has forecast an operating profit margin of 5 percent for this financial year, the lowest among Japanese rivals including Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co.The compensation for Ghosn, who has led Nissan since 2001, is higher than that of his peers at other Japanese companies, many of whom have risen through the ranks over their careers.Akio Toyoda, president of the world’s best-selling automaker Toyota and the scion of the founding family, was paid 230 million yen excluding stock options for the year ended in March, up 25 percent from a year ago, the carmaker said on Tuesday.Ghosn is also paid as CEO of Renault SA, Nissan’s alliance partner. In 2013 the French automaker paid Ghosn 2.61 million euros ($3.6 million).	1.838767345
* To seek broad collaboration, including in environment and safety* Toyota chief says his company can learn a lot from Mazda* Toyota, Mazda chiefs say tie-up not aimed at scale* Automakers already cooperate in tech, manufacturing (Adds executive comments, recasts throughout with context)By Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp announced a long-term partnership that would go beyond project-based tie-ups in an industry where rivals are increasingly turning to each other for help.Automakers worldwide are joining forces to cut costs by building scale and spreading the load of heavy investments in new technologies.While Toyota and Mazda said they hoped to collaborate across a broad range of fields including environmental and advanced safety technologies, they stressed that their link-up was also aimed at learning from each other to make more appealing cars.“It’s not at all about scale, or something that can be seen or measured,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told a news conference on Wednesday, likening the tie-up to an “engagement��.“We think we have a lot to learn from Mazda,�� he said, noting the smaller automaker had won many prestigious Car of the Year awards, unlike Toyota.The deal is a ringing endorsement for Mazda, a second-tier Japanese automaker whose spending on research on development is a tenth of Toyota’s but which has won over fans with its sporty, design-conscious cars powered by its Skyactiv series of fuel-efficient engines and vehicle architecture.Toyoda and his Mazda counterpart, Masamichi Kogai, sidestepped questions about whether a capital alliance could be on the horizon.“I won’t talk about the hypothetical,�� Toyoda said, while Kogai said it wasn’t part of Wednesday’s agreement.Nissan Motor Co, Japan’s second-biggest automaker behind Toyota, has an alliance with France’s Renault SA , the French company owning 43.4 percent of Nissan.Already the world’s top-selling automaker, Toyota is on a mission, led by founding family chief Toyoda, to make cars that consumers would want to buy for reasons other than dependability and quality, which the brand has been known for.Toyoda said he admired Mazda for succeeding in rebuilding itself after a turbulent period that included financial difficulties, which saw it come under the control of Ford Motor Co, and then losing those ties when the U.S. giant itself needed to cash out to shore up its finances.Toyota and Mazda said they would set up a joint committee to work out how to collaborate, and in what areas, in agreements that would go “beyond the traditional framework of cooperation.”The two companies now have technology and manufacturing tie-ups in which Mazda licenses gasoline-electric hybrid technology from Toyota, and will soon start producing in Mexico a small sedan based on the Mazda2, using its Skyactiv engine, for Toyota’s Scion youth brand.

BEIJING, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is poised to overtake its Japanese rivals on the top seller’s list in China as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co struggle to regain market share following a flare-up in anti-Japanese sentiment a year ago.For much of the past decade, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has languished some way behind Japanese brands and South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. And it has lagged a long way behind General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG in China.That’s mainly because of Ford’s late foray into China and the subsequent, conservative approach it has taken in an auto market that became the world’s biggest in 2009.Ford is fighting to change that picture and appears likely to sell more vehicles in China this year than two of its main Japanese rivals - Toyota and Honda. Its China sales are also zooming close to those of Nissan Motor Co.Ford is likely to sell more than 900,000 vehicles, including passenger cars and commercial vehicles, in China this year thanks to its beefed-up product lineup, said a company official who spoke on condition of anonymity. New in the showroom since last year are a couple of small sport-utility vehicles and the redesigned Focus car.It has also just launched the redesigned Mondeo car, a China version of the car marketed in North America as the Fusion.The American automaker sold 647,849 vehicles during the first nine months of the year, up 51 percent, Ford said in a statement on Wednesday.“We should be able to sell more than 900,000 vehicles, possibly close to a million in China this year,�� the Ford official said.Toyota is targeting to sell about 900,000 vehicles and Honda about 750,000 in China this year. China-based spokespeople at the two firms said they were on track to meet those objectives.Nissan is aiming to sell 1.25 million vehicles, but a Nissan company executive speaking on condition of anonymity said last month the company was “stretching to achieve�� that goal.The Japanese carmakers have, however, recorded a sharp rise in year-on-year sales last month partly due to the low base from last September, when Japan’s decision to nationalize disputed islands in the East China Sea sparked anti-Japan sentiment among Chinese consumers.Ford and the Japanese carmakers are still no match for the likes of General Motors and Volkswagen.GM Group expects to sell more than 3 million vehicles in China this year. Its volume in China is forecast to grow 8 to 10 percent over last year, when the U.S. group sold a total of 2.84 million vehicles.According to consulting firm LMC Automotive, the Volkswagen Group is forecast to sell about 3.2 million vehicles this year in China, up from 2.8 million vehicles it sold in 2012.LMC says Hyundai Group’s sales in China this year should reach 1.64 million vehicles, up from 1.4 million last year.During the first nine months of this year, Toyota sold a total of about 636,700 vehicles, down 0.5 percent from a year earlier. Honda sold 497,261 vehicles, up 5.8 percent, while Nissan sold 885,700 vehicles, up 0.2 percent.Since Ford began an aggressive push to overhaul and beef up its product lineup for China over the past two years, “sales have been growing in leaps and bounds,�� said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight.That momentum should not only remain intact for the rest of this year but should become “even stronger�� next year and beyond, Zhang said, adding that Ford expected to start production at a major assembly plant in the eastern city of Hangzhou around 2015.	-0.5621047701
* Magazine drops Camry, Prius v, RAV4 after poor crash test scores* Toyota, Lexus brands top new-car reliability survey* Subaru Forester rated most reliable vehicleDETROIT, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s reputation for quality took a hit on Monday when influential magazine Consumer Reports pulled its recommendation on three of the Japanese automaker’s vehicles, including its popular flagship Camry sedan, due to poor crash test results.While Toyota’s luxury Lexus and namesake brands were ranked most reliable in the U.S. auto industry in Consumer Reports�� annual new-car reliability survey, the magazine said it will no longer recommend the Camry, Prius v model or RAV4 sport utility vehicle because they received “poor�� ratings in a crash test started last year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.“We’re a year into it, we’ve got over 50 vehicles tested and there’s enough that are doing adequately on this test that now we’re making the shift and pulling recommendations from any car that gets a poor�� rating, Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, said of the IIHS test.“Honestly, we don’t take this lightly, but virtually every vehicle now in the family sedan category has been tested and the only one that has gotten a ‘poor�� is the Camry,�� he added. “At this point, we don’t feel we can continue to recommend people buy a Camry when there’s other good choices out there that do better on the test.”Consumer Reports is one of the most widely trusted names for consumers shopping for cars, and companies try to ensure their vehicles earn the magazine’s coveted “recommended�� rating.Last year, the IIHS, a non-profit group funded by the insurance industry, increased the rigor of its tests to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle. Consumer Reports waited to adjust its buyer recommendations until it saw how the entire industry was affected by the test.The magazine does not recommend consumers buy a car that fares poorly in any crash tests.In the first nine months of the year, the Camry was the third-most-sold vehicle in the United States, behind two full-size pickup trucks. Its sales were up 1.3 percent from the year-ago period to 318,990 cars, compared with an increase of almost 14 percent by rival Honda Motor Co’s Accord sedan.Toyota has made changes to the Camry to improve its performance in the crash tests and IIHS is planning to retest the car in December, IIHS spokesman Russ Rader said. Companies that have modified a vehicle design sometimes seek a retest.Last December, when IIHS gave the Camry its “poor�� rating, it said the company’s engineers had “a lot of work to do to match the performance of their competitors.�� Toyota officials said on Monday they “are looking at a range of solutions�� to address the car’s performance in the crash test.Last month, Toyota’s Corolla small car, which was redesigned for the 2014 model year, received a “marginal�� rating on the IIHS crash test.In addition to the three Toyota vehicles, Consumer Reports also dropped Volkswagen’s Audi A4 car from its recommended list due to a “poor�� rating on the IIHS test, Fisher said.Ten other vehicles also lost their recommended status, but that was due to the overall quality of vehicles in their segments and not related to their crash test performances, he said.The IIHS, which continues to score vehicles on side, rear, roll-over and front-end crashes, added an overlap test because nearly one-fourth of U.S. front-of-vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death involve a single corner that strikes another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole.In the overlap test, IIHS crashes a vehicle at 40 miles per hour into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver’s side that overlaps one-quarter of the vehicle’s width.In its annual reliability rankings, Toyota’s Lexus was at the top, followed by the Toyota brand. Rounding out the top 10 were Honda’s Acura, Audi, Mazda, Nissan’s Infiniti, Volvo, Honda, General Motors Co’s GMC truck brand and Subaru.The vehicle with the top predicted reliability score was the 2014 Subaru Forester SUV, while Ford Co’s C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid vehicle received the worst score, Consumer Reports said.Two popular models, Honda’s redesigned 2013 Accord with a V6 engine and the 2013 Nissan Altima, scored too poorly for Consumer Reports to continue recommending them.One of the main problem areas in the survey was in-car electronics, including infotainment systems. Of the 17 categories tracked, the area generated the most complaints, including buggy systems with screen freezes, touch control lag or a reluctance to recognize a cell phone or other device.For instance, last year, Ford tumbled to nearly the bottom of the survey due to flaws in its touch-screen navigation and entertainment system, MyFord Touch.This year, continued problems with the infotainment system, as well as several EcoBoost turbocharged V6 models having poor reliability, left Ford’s namesake and Lincoln luxury brands ranked No. 26 and 27, respectively, ahead of only BMW’s Mini. Of the 31 Ford models in the survey, only one, the F-150 pickup with the 3.7-liter V6 engine, was above average, while seven scored average.GM’s Cadillac brand fell the most in the survey, dropping 14 spots to No. 25 as its CUE infotainment system suffered from issues similar to Ford’s. The GM brand also lost the benefit of older cars that typically have fewer problems than newer models.GM’s Buick and Chevrolet brands ranked No. 12 and No. 17, respectively.Smaller U.S. rival Chrysler ranked No. 18, while its Ram truck, Jeep SUV and Dodge brands were No. 19, No. 23 and No. 24, respectively.Tesla Motor Inc’s Model S electric sedan performed well enough in the reliability survey to earn a recommendation for the first time.Consumer Reports said the findings in its survey are based on subscribers�� experiences with 1.1 million vehicles. It uses the findings to compile reliability histories on vehicles and predict how well new cars will hold up.	-3.024428073
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday received more awards for initial quality from J.D. Power than any other automaker in the U.S. market, as its chief executive officer was grilled by a U.S. congressional committee about safety issues.It was the second year in a row that GM had the most models named with the best initial quality in the annual J.D. Power study.South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co took five awards and was the best overall mass-market brand in the survey, jumping to fourth place from 10th a year ago.The top three brand’s in the study that asks consumers to report problems in the first 90 days of new-vehicle ownership, were Volkswagen’s luxury brand Porsche (VOWG_p.DE&gt;, Tata Motor’s Jaguar and Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus luxury brand.Among GM models to win were Malibu for best midsize sedan, GMC Terrain for compact SUV, and Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon for large SUV.Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power, said it was a turnabout from years when U.S. automakers lagged far behind Toyota and Honda Motor Co as the Japanese automakers dominated the study, now in its 28th year. Toyota and Honda combined each received one top award for its models.Overall, Honda and Toyota are still highly regarded by new-vehicle owners. The study found the Toyota brand as fifth among 32 brands, and Honda eighth.GM’s mass-market Chevrolet brand was sixth.Meanwhile GM CEO Mary Barra will appear before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee to face intense questioning about whether the automaker has a grip on the safety crisis that has enveloped it this year.The No. 1 U.S. automaker has come under fire from the Justice Department, lawmakers and other authorities probing why it waited more than a decade to recall 2.6 million cars with an ignition-switch flaw that has been tied to at least 13 deaths.Sargent said the overall quality of cars sold in the United States has never been better. Lower-priced cars from manufacturers like Hyundai are right up there in terms of initial quality with expensive models from Porsche and Jaguar, said Sargent.Some brands fell in the rankings, in large part because of newly launched models that have yet to work out bugs in new technology, such as voice recognition, Bluetooth pairing and auto systems, he said.Ford Motor Co, which in recent years fell in the rankings because of problems with information-entertainment systems, is no longer below the industry average in the J.D. Power study.“Ford worked through those problems,�� said Sargent, and as an early adopter in bringing new technology into vehicles, helped the quality of information-entertainment systems among all automakers.In general, Sargent said, consumers have more difficulty overcoming design problems than defects. A defect can be fixed at a local dealership, while design problems are systemic and often are not fixed until a new model year or new generation for that particular model.Finishing at the bottom of the study was Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s Fiat brand, and next-to-last was Jeep, a key brand for Fiat-Chrysler.Vehicles in the study were all from the 2014 model year.	0.7728237792

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it will transfer its Yaris compact car production for North America to France from Japan in May next year, marking the first time the company will export cars from Europe to that market.Analysts said the move, announced by Toyota late on Friday, is aimed at keeping a strong yen and soaring energy costs from affecting its earnings. Other Japanese automakers have also shifted some export production out of Japan.The yen dipped below 78 against the dollar at the start of June on a growing debt crisis in Europe, though it has since weakened to above 80 yen to the dollar at the end of this week following polls in Greece that elected a pro-bailout government.The move by Toyota follows plans by domestic rivals Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T to open new factories in Mexico to serve North America and reduce loss-making exports from Japan.Car makers in Japan also face costly labor regulations, high corporate taxes and an energy policy deadlock after last year’s Fukushima crisis that led to a shutdown of all of the country’s nuclear reactors.Toyota, which lost the crown as the world’s top automaker last year, also said the annual export volume from France to the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico combined would be around 25,000 units. The Yaris is known as the Vitz domestically.The shift will require investment of an additional 8 million euros ($10 million) for the production from the French plant to meet the specific requirements of the North American market.Only gasoline versions of Yaris will be exported to North America, Toyota said.	-4.087265081
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS plans to start making the gasoline-electric hybrid version of its new Sonata sedan in China starting late this year, seeking to drive sales of environmentally friendly cars in the world's biggest car market.This would be its first hybrid car to be produced overseas, a Hyundai Motor spokeswoman said on Thursday. Sonata hybrids being sold in the United States and other markets are currently made in South Korea.Segment leader Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and local China brands such as Geely are embracing conventional hybrid cars, even though the technology does not receive as generous an incentives from Beijing as all-electric cars and heavily electrified plug-in hybrids.Toyota, which already assembles the Prius and Camry hybrids in China with component and system kits brought in from Japan, last year announced a plan to start sales of Corolla and Levin models equipped with China-produced major hybrid components in 2015. Honda Motor 7267.T plans to start making hybrid cars in China by 2016.Last year, Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS said they would triple their number of green vehicles by 2020 as part of efforts to raise fuel economy by 25 percent by that year and address investor concerns about the pair's lack of green credentials. 	-2.485659656
(Recasts, adds U.S. zero-emission rule)* Fuel-cell focused Hyundai answers calls for more zero-emission cars* Battery focused Kia likely to sell fuel-cell car in the future* Kia aims to sell 5,000 Soul EVs globally this yearBy Hyunjoo JinHWASEONG, South Korea, March 11 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co , South Korea’s champion of fuel-cell electric vehicles (EV), will answer calls for manufacturers to make more zero-emission cars by launching its first rechargeable battery-powered vehicle in 2016.Hyundai, like Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp, has long concentrated on fuel-cell vehicles powered by electricity generated using hydrogen, touting their longer driving range and shorter refill times.But like Toyota, Hyundai is expanding its offering by also investing in battery-powered cars - the staple green offering of Hyundai affiliate Kia Motors Corp.“There is no clear direction about which eco-friendly cars will win. We are dividing the roles of Hyundai and Kia, with Hyundai launching fuel cell cars and Kia focusing on electric cars,�� said Senior Vice President Lee Ki-sang, who leads the eco-friendly car divisions of both Hyundai and Kia.“But the time will come when Kia will introduce a fuel-cell car. Hyundai is also preparing to launch a (battery-powered) electric car in 2016.”Zero-emission vehicles are likely to become a more frequent sight as governments devise environment-friendly initiatives. California, for instance, requires auto makers produce a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles as part of their overall fleet or buy credits from manufacturers who have produced more.Kia, 34 percent owned by Hyundai, has favoured battery-powered cars because they can be charged at home as well as at charging stations. Fuel-cell cars must be refilled with hydrogen only at filling stations.So far, a lack of charging stations and relatively short driving ranges, as well as high prices resulting from the cost of batteries, has kept the battery-powered EV market niche.Korean sales of Kia’s Ray EV, Renault SA’s SM3 EV and General Motors Co’s Spark EV totalled just 713 vehicles last year, industry data showed. Hyundai’s BlueOn is only used by government agencies.Even so, the number of battery-powered EVs is on the rise, as BMW’s i3 and Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s Leaf are widely expected to reach Korea this year - as will Kia’s Soul EV.At a news conference on Tuesday, Kia said it will start building a battery-powered version of its Soul compact in Korea next month. The car will be Hyundai-Kia’s first battery-powered EV export, with destinations including the U.S. and Europe.For this year, the global sales target is 5,000 Soul EVs, said Cho Yong-won, vice president of Kia’s Domestic Marketing Group.In Korea, the Soul EV will cost about half of its 42 million won ($39,400) price tag after government subsidies, similar to the higher-end model of the gasoline version.The car can run up to 148 km (92 miles) per 24 to 33 minute fast charge or four hours on slow charge.	-8.06508981
SEOUL (Reuters) - Pre-orders for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone have exceeded those of its predecessor S7, the firm’s mobile chief said on Thursday, suggesting many consumers are unfazed by last year’s Galaxy Note 7 fires.Strong initial demand for the S8 will be encouraging for a firm recovering from one of the worst product safety failures in tech history, which ended in the Note 7’s swift withdrawal.The new smartphone has received favorable reviews ahead of the start of sales in South Korea, the United States and Canada on April 21. Some investors and analysts have even predicted a first-year sales record for the South Korean company.“It’s still a bit early, but initial response to the pre-orders that have begun at various places across the world have been better than expected,�� mobile chief Koh Dong-jin said at an S8 media briefing.He said the S8 will be the safest Galaxy smartphone to date due to measures implemented to avoid the battery failures that caused some Note 7s to spontaneously combust.Analysts said strong S8 sales are likely to help Samsung to its best-ever quarterly profit in April-June, along with a booming memory chip market that is widely expected to deliver record revenue this year for the industry as a whole.Samsung has been working to restore investor trust as well as its reputation since the Note 7’s withdrawal in October within two months of being on the market, losing out on $5.4 billion in profit.Senior executives told foreign media on the sidelines of the briefing that it will take time for Samsung’s brand image to recover. They also said Samsung has seen a rebound in consumer sentiment toward the firm since announcing the results of a probe into the fires and preventative measures on Jan. 23.“It took Toyota about four years for its brand to get back to where it was, and I think ours can do it faster,�� said Lee Young-hee, an executive vice president at Samsung’s mobile business, referring to a series of Toyota Motor Corp vehicle recalls from 2009 to 2011.S8 advertising focuses on features such as almost bezel-less screens rather than highlighting safety. Executives said this was deliberate in the belief that Samsung has done enough to convince consumers the Note 7’s problems will not be repeated.“We felt really comfortable that we had attained a level of confidence with consumers so that we could actually shift to the product campaign,�� said Pio Schunker, global head of integrated marketing for Samsung’s mobile business.“Ultimately I think it is this product that proves this case.��	2.140526013
TOYOTA, Japan (Reuters) - When Tokuo Fukuichi was brought back to Toyota Motor Corp to become head of design, he was given a simple directive from President Akio Toyoda: make Toyota cars simple and cool. He took a risk and objected.“I said, look, Mr. President, just cool is not good enough,�� Fukuichi told Reuters. “Toyota had already tried hard to fix ugly parts and make them look better. What Toyota lacks the most is character.”Fukuichi, 61, knows something about character. In the late 1980s, he designed the first generation Previa, also known as the “egg-van�� -- one of the most love-it-or-hate-it Toyota vehicles ever.For Toyoda, who has criticized his company for losing sight of the fun and excitement of the automobile and has tried to shake up its stodgy and engineer-dominated design process, Fukuichi brought the right kind of edginess to the job. In a rare move, he asked Fukuichi to rejoin Toyota in 2011 after he had left for group company Kanto Auto Works.Two years on, Toyota’s designs are starting to show signs of change. From luxury brand Lexus’s pinched-in-the-middle “spindle�� grille to the Auris hatchback’s sharply angled headlights, Toyota is taking steps to distance itself from a legacy of “plain vanilla�� styling.Not everyone is happy. At a shareholders�� meeting in June, the very first issue raised from the floor was a complaint about the new “face�� of Lexus models. But Fukuichi is unfazed.“If we don’t take risks now, there will be no future for us,�� he said.The latest evidence of Toyota’s newfound willingness to take risks with the look of its cars will be on show at Monday’s Detroit auto show when Toyota reveals the Furia concept sedan, expected to give consumers a sense of what is coming when it launches the next version of its top-selling Corolla sedan.Analysts say Toyota, the world’s largest car maker by sales volume, has been driven to change. Toyota is being is squeezed between brands such as BMW and Volkswagen’s Audi, which are seen as leaders in design, and a fast-rising rival in Hyundai that has won praise for the way it has managed to make its mass-market sedans look far more expensive than their sticker prices.“Competitors are on the rise, and they are generally improving in areas such as safety technology and fuel efficiency,�� said Kunihiro Matsumoto, an autos analyst at UBS Securities in Japan.“So Toyota needs to distinguish itself in other ways. There is still room for Toyota to improve its products through design.”Toyota executives know that their cars have traditionally sold on quality rather than looks. Some, like generations of the Camry, have been famed for an inoffensive styling that was aimed straight at the middle-of-the road.“Before, our craftsmanship was focused on cutting out flaws. That led to cars that were not hated by anyone, but also not enthusiastically sought after by anyone,�� said Fukuichi.In an effort to fix that, he has shaken up a tradition of design-by-committee.About 100 panel members used to give scores to designs, which would then be tweaked to reflect their varying opinions and become less edgy. Some 30 executives were involved in making the final decision at the design tower in Toyota headquarters, near Nagoya.Now, designers recommend the model they back most strongly. Comments from panel members are taken into consideration but do not necessarily determine the design, and the number executives with a say has been cut to a third of what it was.“It’s no longer a democratic decision,�� Fukuichi, told Reuters in a recent interview.FORGET ‘KAIZEN’In recent years, Toyota’s South Korean rivals Hyundai and its affiliate Kia have won kudos for styling, helping to transform the consumer image of those brands.Hyundai last year hired former BMW designer Christopher Chapman as chief designer at its U.S. design center, while Kia promoted Peter Schreyer, a former Volkswagen designer, as the first foreign president.In an effort to catch up, Toyota has paired more aggressive designs with edgy marketing, eyeing younger buyers.Promotional images for the Crown luxury sedan that most buyers will seek in black or white have used a flamingo-pink version of the car, which features a big, lightning bolt-shaped grille, with the tagline “Reborn��.One Japanese newspaper ad has popular comedian and film director Takeshi Kitano staring at the new Crown as if he’s not sure what to make of it.Experts say one of Toyota’s challenges will be building a continuity into its styling so consumers can recognize one of its models from a block away - as they can with Audi or BMW.“There are many European automakers that have inherited design with their own identity. Japanese cars do not have that, and without the badge, it is hard to tell which brand it is,�� said Takao Kijima, a professor at the Tokyo University of Science, Yamaguchi who for years worked in the auto industry.Toyota’s engineering and production has been defined by the philosophy of “kaizen��, or continuous improvement, helping it excel at refining existing technologies. But when it comes to design, Fukuichi says Toyota needs to throw out what has been one of the central organizing principles of the company.“By doing kaizen, you might be able to be a fashion model with a good figure, but not an actress -- unforgettable even if she has a less attractive figure and an unusual face,�� he said.Experts generally laud Toyota’s efforts to change, although they caution it will be a tough message for the conservative company to absorb. Some warn that changing the design too aggressively for conservative signature cars -- like the Crown and Lexus models -- could alienate existing fans.“Those cars are wonderful like really well-tailored, sophisticated suits,�� said Kunihisa Ito, a professor at College for Creative Studies in Detroit. “For Toyota to pursue an aggressive character, could mean losing its original beauty.��	7.654958678
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor and General Motors are considering jointly building a fuel cell plant as the automakers try to cut the cost of developing electric cars, Japan’s Asahi Shimbun daily reported on Saturday.They aim to start the mass production of fuel cells by 2025 at the latest, the paper reported.Honda and GM have been collaborating on developing fuel cells since 2013.While working jointly on fuel cells, the two companies continue to develop their own cars separately, Asahi reported.The huge cost required to develop fuel cells has prompted the world’s carmakers to cooperate with their rivals.Daimler AG, Ford Motor and Nissan Motor jointly develop fuel cells while Toyota Motor is in partnership with BMW in the area.	-5.920709442
NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. banks looking to get in on a booming market for financing new-car sales have run into a formidable competitor: the auto manufacturers themselves.Financing arms of car companies, including Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Ford Motor Co, made half of all new U.S. car loans in the first quarter, up from 37 percent a year earlier and the largest percentage of the market in four years, according to credit data firm Experian.These companies also write the vast majority of leases, which contributed a record 26 percent of new car sales in the quarter, up from 23 percent last year and 20 percent in 2012.The financing arms are providing subsidies from the manufacturers, lowering monthly payments and extending loan terms to make it easier for buyers to drive away in a shiny, new vehicle. As a result, major banks are increasingly moving into riskier parts of the market to make loans.US Bancorp, for example, for the first time ever decided to start financing used cars, an area of the market that the automakers�� finance companies have little interest in. It also started offering loans to less creditworthy borrowers.And Wells Fargo &amp; Co has been leveraging off a nationwide deal with General Motors Co to provide loans subsidized by the No. 1 U.S. automaker. Wells sees this as a way to gain more of the used car loan business at GM dealerships.The aggressive push by car companies is beginning to raise questions among industry analysts and consultants about whether it is sustainable.If interest rates rise, the automakers could find the incentives too costly unless they are prepared to take a hit to profits - with any pullback in the deals being offered customers running the risk of hurting demand. And, if used car prices weaken, the financing units could be hit with losses on vehicles coming back from leases and repossessions.The automakers�� financing companies are doing substantially more than they were just a year or two ago, said April Ancira, vice president in the San Antonio office of Ancira Motor Co, a Texas-based group with 11 dealerships selling GM, Nissan, Fiat, Chrysler, VW and Ford cars.“They’re being very aggressive with incentives,�� Ancira said.Pete Carey, vice president for sales at Toyota Financial Services, said incentives are playing a bigger role as automakers look to stand out in a crowded market where the basic quality of cars is uniformly good.“We’re at a point in the industry that we’re spending as much as we’ve ever spent,�� Carey said.The strategy is currently paying off in spades for automakers. All the major automakers posted healthy profits in the first quarter. U.S. car sales rebounded in May to an annualized rate of 16.8 million vehicles, against 15.6 million for all of last year. Sales were only 10.4 million in 2009 as the recession crushed demand.Outstanding U.S. loans on new cars totaled $811 billion at the end of March, up 11.6 percent from a year earlier, according to Experian.The automakers are in a position to offer the deals because their cost of borrowing has gone down as their balance sheets have improved and as bond investors have lined up to buy securities backed by loans and leases.But they risk sweetening the deals so much that it starts to cut into their profit margins. In a few years time, as the leased vehicles are returned, the strategy could lead to a glut in the used-car market.If a car turns out to be worth less at the end of a lease than projected, the finance company will take a loss on the lease, said Jim Ziegler, a consultant to car dealers. “It appears as a profit until they get the car back,�� Ziegler said.Analysts at Moody’s Investors Service said car resale values at the end of leases have so far tended to be higher than assumed, resulting in double-digit gains for finance companies and lease investors. But the gains have started to decelerate to single-digits now and they expect to see that downward pressure continue this year.“There is still room for used car prices to decline before we see any losses,�� said Aron Bergman, of Moody’s. But, he added, “the gains are going down.”The average monthly lease payment for the most-leased car in America, the Honda Civic, was $251 in the first quarter, according to Experian.But when Jonathan Stierwald, a Minnesota resident, wanted to lease a car for his nephew, he found Mike Piazza Honda in Pennsylvania willing to lease him the car for three years for just $80 a month. He flew there to get the deal. The lease was financed by Honda’s finance arm.The details of the deal could not be determined. A salesman at the Langhorne, Pennsylvania dealership, which is owned by Piazza, the former All-Star baseball catcher, said factors such as a high credit score and higher down-payment may have helped. Honda representative Steve Kinkade said the dealership could have added its own incentives on top of the company’s promotions.Honda, which was fifth in U.S. auto sales in the first five months of the year, increased its average subsidy per leased car by 26 percent to $1,476 in that period from a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com.Kinkade said the company is pleased with how its finance unit has paced its leasing to drive sales without too many of the cars later coming onto the used car market and depressing prices.Others are liberally using subsidies, too. Toyota subsidized 92 percent of its U.S. leases in its fiscal year ending in March, up from 82 percent the year before.“We can get fairly aggressive with pricing or payments, depending on what we anticipate the used market to look like,�� Toyota’s Carey said.Auto industry analysts and consultants said they did not think the situation was getting out of hand just yet.The average incentive per car sold so far this year was $2,918, up slightly from $2,825 a year earlier and just under 10 percent of the average transaction price, according to JD Power &amp; Associates data.Automaker finance arms are also offering loans at interest rates as low as zero percent. And, they are taking on more loans to borrowers with subprime credit ratings, according to data from Experian.The length of loans is also increasing. Lenders granted one-in-four new car buyers more than six years to repay in the first quarter, up from one-in-five a year earlier, the figures show.The average monthly payment on new car loans was $474 in the first quarter, only $15 more than a year earlier, even as the average amount financed rose by $964 to a record $27,612.Unable to compete, some banks are in retreat.Ally Financial Inc, which was once GM’s financing arm but is now on its own, increased its financing of used car purchases by 14 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, but its new car lending declined so much that it made 6 percent fewer auto loans in total.US Bancorp estimated that used cars will eventually make up40 percent of its auto loans after doing none in the past. Consumers with “nonprime�� credit scores, defined as below 675, will account for 15 percent of US Bancorp’s portfolio, compared with none previously.Not that the opportunity in the used car market isn’t also large - in terms of numbers of vehicles sold the used car market is more than twice the size of the new-car market.Tom Wolfe, executive vice president of consumer credit solutions at Wells Fargo, said its partnership with GM improves its ties with dealers and that for every subsidized new car loan it makes for GM at a dealer it will pick up three used-car loans. Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. used-car lender with a 7.1 percent market share, according to Experian.Wolfe said customers who borrow to buy a used car so that they can get to and from work are good credit risks.	4.079315164
General Motors can find some small comfort in Toyota’s recall ride. Before Chief Executive Mary Barra was hauled up to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the U.S. automaker summoned more vehicles back into the shop and doubled the estimated cost of fixing safety issues in the first quarter. Toyota’s expensive accelerator fiasco suggests GM’s costs will probably rise from here, but ultimately the financial fallout should be manageable. Culture may be the harder repair.The problems that afflicted Toyota from 2009 to 2011 have cost at least $3.2 billion so far. That includes the $1.2 billion Toyota agreed to pay last month to settle a Department of Justice probe, $1.1 billion in recall-related expenses that Toyota estimated in 2010 and roughly $900 million of lost sales. Omitted is the cost of ongoing civil litigation and harder-to-measure items like any possible damage to Toyota’s reputation. The sum is nevertheless a safe starting point for GM.To date, Toyota’s recall has cost it 1.5 percent of 2013 sales. If GM’s experience is similar, its costs before civil litigation would amount to about $2.3 billion, or three times the upwardly revised figure GM just released as an estimated first-quarter charge.There are some important differences to keep in mind. While Toyota’s recall involved more cars, its accelerator problem also may have caused less than half as many fatalities. Assume GM’s costs increase in proportion with the death toll, currently estimated at 13, and exclude private lawsuits, and the cost might exceed $7 billion. That would represent about 5 percent of the Chevy maker’s 2013 sales.It would sting for sure, but since bankruptcy helped GM’s balance sheet and may shield the company from some liability, the amount could be manageable. There probably will be other costs to consider, too, though. One is higher capital expenditures. Toyota, for example, committed to invest $50 million over five years on a new U.S. safety lab. Tougher engineering rigor and recall-happy management may also increase the overall tab.During her congressional testimony, Barra emphasized that GM had moved “from a cost culture after the bankruptcy to a customer culture.�� That suggests she understands the perception that GM may have skimped its way into its current troubles. The company’s real cost could be completing the transformation.	-3.094146685

SEOUL, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Kia Motors needs to set up a factory in India to tap growth there and offset slowing sales in Russia and China, the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper quoted the South Korean automaker’s chief executive as saying.India is expected to become the world’s third largest auto market by next year, according to industry data provider IHS. Kia Motors, an affiliate of Hyundai Motor Co, currently has no production in India, and high import taxes mean Kia’s India sales are also negligible.By contrast, Hyundai has two factories in India and is the country’s second-largest automaker after Maruti Suzuki India Ltd .“While growth in Russia or China is stagnating, India is where Kia will ultimately make a leap forward,�� Kia CEO Park Han-woo, a former head of Hyundai Motor’s Indian unit, told the newspaper.The report gave no further details and a Kia Motors spokesman said the automaker had “no current plan to build a new factory in India or enter the market��.Park also said Kia was developing a rival to Toyota Motor’s Prius hybrid cars, but gave no details. Hyundai Motor has said it plans to roll out a hybrid-dedicated model this year. (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Miral Fahmy)	5.482827661

TURIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Thursday brushed off a shock lawsuit from General Motors Co and said it was confident of reaching a binding merger deal with Peugeot owner PSA Group by the end of this year to create the world’s fourth-largest carmaker.GM filed the lawsuit in the United States on Wednesday, alleging FCA had bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.FCA said the suit, seeking substantial damages, was “meritless�� and appeared intended to disrupt the Italian-American company’s planned $50 billion merger with France’s PSA.“The GM lawsuit will be dealt with in appropriate places, but as we’ve said already it is absolutely groundless and so it does not worry us,�� FCA Chairman John Elkann told reporters at a strategy briefing for Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family which is FCA’s largest shareholder.“Looking at how teams are working, both in FCA and PSA, I am encouraged to say that between now and year-end, we’ll have a binding memorandum signed,�� he added.JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a research note that GM could seek at least $6 billion in damages, but added a trial could be years away. He also noted that if GM’s allegations were vindicated, Ford Motor Co could have a claim. Ford declined to comment.At a Barclays auto conference in New York on Thursday, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra defended the lawsuit, noting she has often said: “�Give us a level playing field, and General Motors will compete, and we’ll win.�� And so when we saw facts indicated that was not the case, we felt it was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders in the company.”GM shares fell 1.7% to close at $34.67 on Thursday, while Fiat Chrysler shares fell 0.5% to $14.92 in New York. PSA closed nearly unchanged at 22.47 euros.PSA declined to comment on the lawsuit and any potential impact on the merger talks.FCA and PSA announced plans last month to combine forces to better tackle the cost of new technologies such as electric and self-driving vehicles as well as a downturn in auto markets.The merger would create a group with 8.7 million in annual vehicle sales, overtaking GM and putting it fourth globally behind Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and the Renault-Nissan alliance.In a letter to employees about the GM lawsuit, FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley said: “We are astonished by this filing, both its content and its timing. We can only assume it was intended to disrupt our proposed merger with PSA.”In September 2015, FCA’s former chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, urged his GM counterpart, Barra, to consider a tie-up of the two carmakers. GM rebuffed FCA’s advances.GM on Wednesday alleged that after it rejected a merger bid from FCA, Marchionne conspired to negotiate a new four-year contract with the UAW “designed, through the power of pattern bargaining, to cost GM billions.�� Marchionne died in 2018.FCA will vigorously defend itself against this “meritless�� lawsuit, Manley said in the letter to staff, seen by Reuters.“We will not be slowed down by this act,�� he said, adding: “Let’s keep the performance up as it has clearly got some of our competitors worried.”Manley was not named in the GM complaint and a source close to FCA said he was not linked to the case.Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, also said Exor and the Peugeot family were committed to providing maximum support to the merged company and would provide stability for it in the years ahead.“We’ve been stable investors in the auto industry for the past 120 years, so, yes, I still see ourselves as stable investors in the auto industry in the next 10 years,�� Elkann said of Exor.	-0.3999158072
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s automaking lobby on Thursday said that it welcomed the fact that the United States would refrain from raising tariffs on Japanese car imports for the moment after the two countries agreed to start discussing a new trade framework.""We welcome the fact that U.S. tariffs related to the Section 232 investigation into auto imports will not be invoked while negotiations are occurring,"" said Akio Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and president of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday announced the start of new trade talks which for now, protects Japanese automakers from further tariffs, seen as a major threat to the export-dependent economy."	-7.463285451
TOKYO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Japanese automotive parts maker Akebono Brake Industry Co said it discovered a case of inappropriate accounting and delayed the filing of its quarterly results to investigate other possible breaches.The news may rekindle fears of more Japanese accounting scandals after Toshiba Corp earlier this year revealed that it overstated past profits by 155 billion yen ($1.3 billion).Akebono Brake supplies to General Motors, Nissan Motor and Toyota Motor, who make up around half of its sales, according to Akebono’s last earnings report.Akebono Brake found that it overstated sales by around 210 million yen ($1.7 million) in September, and was now studying whether there were other cases of inappropriate book-keeping, the company said in a regulatory filing.It was originally due to announce its July-September results on Wednesday, but it said it would take around a month for an independent committee to investigate.Independent investigators who probed Toshiba blamed a breakdown in governance and a corporate culture that discouraged workers from questioning their superiors.

Jan 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it is expanding its recall involving Takata Corp front passenger air bag inflators to about 601,300 additional vehicles in the United States. [toyota.us/2CV24Wl ]Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after more than 100 million of its airbags were recalled because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments.The airbags have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 18 deaths, including one in Louisiana that was identified last month.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota, Honda and Nissan became the latest foreign carmakers to respond to China’s anti-monopoly investigation into the auto industry, as the probe’s impact extends beyond foreign luxury auto brands.GAC Toyota Motor Co, Toyota’s joint venture with China’s GAC Group, and Guangqi Honda Automobile Co, Honda’s venture with GAC, both said late on Friday they would cut spare part prices due to the investigation.Nissan’s joint venture with China’s Dongfeng Motor Group Co said it paid close attention to the regulator’s suggestions and was actively studying improvements.The moves came on the heels of price cuts by foreign luxury brands including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Chrysler and Jaguar Land Rover over the past month, as China’s price regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), steps up scrutiny of the industry.China has also wielded its anti-monopoly law against other industries, including milk power and software. It targeted multinationals Mead Johnson Nutrition Co and Danone SA, which the regulator slapped with hefty fines, as well as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, which faces the prospect of a $1 billion fine.China’s anti-trust investigations target monopolistic practices in general and aim to promote fair competition and protect consumer interests, China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement posted on the Ministry’s website.Both domestic and foreign firms must bear the due liabilities if they break the law, Shen said.Industry experts say automakers have too much leverage over car dealers and auto part suppliers, enabling them to control prices, considered as a violation of China’s anti-trust laws.China, the world’s biggest auto market, is dominated by foreign brands.	-1.490236382
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor 7201.T, the biggest Japanese automaker in China, is to build a 5 billion yuan ($785 million) plant in the northeast of the country, a person with knowledge of the plan said, extending its reach in the world's largest auto market.The plant, in Dalian city, is part of Nissan's 30 billion yuan investment in China by end-2015, vying with General Motors GM.N and other global automakers also looking to the emerging Asian giant for growth as more developed markets stutter.It also illustrates how the big foreign carmakers are now venturing on to each other’s turf in China to broaden their appeal. In the past decade, foreign brands have carved up China into five territories, building fiefdoms based on their local partnerships. That’s now changing as the rivals set up camp in each other’s backyard.Volkswagen VOWG.DE has been strongest in east and north China through its tie-up with domestic leader SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS and FAW Group, leaving the southern market mostly to Japanese rivals. But the German brand is building its first plant in Guangdong province in the south. It said in November its market share in the south had risen to 15.8 percent from 12 percent two years earlier.Similarly, GM, which has been making cars for more than a decade in Shanghai, recently unveiled plans for a greenfield facility in the central city of Wuhan, a Nissan stronghold, and Ford Motor F.N is venturing outside its southwest 'base' to build a plant in Hangzhou, near Shanghai and GM's patch.A production base in Dalian, the wealthiest coastal city in the northeast, analysts say, would give Nissan easy access to a regional market where Volkswagen and Toyota have been making their Jetta and Corolla models for years.“Nissan will become a major rival for Volkswagen and Toyota in north China with the new plant. It will be cheaper and faster to ship parts to Dalian compared to Wuhan as Dalian is a major port city not that far from Japan,�� said Sheng Ye, associate research director for Greater China at consultancy Ipsos.Dalian had also attracted Fuji Heavy Industries' 7270.T Subaru, which sought approval for a factory there for its ill-fated venture with Chery Automobile CHERY.UL.The Dalian plant, jointly-owned by Nissan and its local partner Dongfeng Motor Group Co 0489.HK, will have an initial capacity of 25,000 cars when it begins production in 2014, the source told Reuters. Capacity would be phased up to 120,000 by 2015 and 240,000 by 2017.“They will be making Nissan’s more upscale SUVs, sedans and MPVs in the new plant. A ground-breaking ceremony has been planned for later this month,�� the person said. Executives at the joint venture could not immediately be reached for comment.“Nissan has a more diversified portfolio in China and has put out more offerings than many of its rivals already. It could bring more of the latest models into China and further expand its appeal with this new plant,�� said John Zeng, Asia Pacific director of consultancy LMC Automotive.China is already Nissan’s largest market even though it arrived much later than GM and Volkswagen. CEO Carlos Ghosn unveiled an ambitious target last July to boost China sales to 2.3 million vehicles in 2015, part of a mid-term business plan to raise Nissan’s global market share and profit margin to 8 percent in six years.To reach that growth target, Nissan’s China venture plans to launch about 30 new products during the period, including an electric vehicle under the joint-venture brand name Venucia, said Ghosn.Nissan sold 1.25 million vehicles in China last year, up 21.9 percent from a year earlier, twice as many as Honda Motor 7267.T, which saw its sales dip 4.5 percent. Toyota delivered 883,000 cars in China last year, down 4.4 percent.To accelerate its China expansion, Nissan will also start making its Infiniti cars at a $315 million plant in Xiangyang in the central Hubei province in 2014 to challenge Audi NSUG.DE, Mercedes Benz and BMW BMWG.DE in the luxury segment.Car sales in China rose 22.6 percent in May from last year, extending April’s double-digit gain. January-May deliveries of sedans, sport utility vehicles, multi-purpose vehicles and minivans climbed 5.5 percent to 6.33 million, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Industry executives predict the market could grow 5-10 percent this year on strong demand in lower-tier cities.	-0.3529411765
NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. consumers have filed a lawsuit against Kobe Steel Ltd 5406.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T accusing the companies of violating consumer protection laws and engaging in fraud by concealing the use of substandard metal components in vehicles.The proposed class-action lawsuit represents the first U.S. consumer complaint filed against Kobe Steel over data fraud, and highlights the legal risks the company faces even after Chief Executive Officer Hiroya Kawasaki announced on Tuesday he would quit to draw a line under the scandal.The 112-year-old company, which supplies steel and aluminum parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to around 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil.Kobe, Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, said on Tuesday that the data fraud had gone on for nearly five decades, and that it found new cases of impropriety, widening the number of affected clients to 605, including 222 overseas. The company said Kawasaki would quit on April 1.The U.S. lawsuit, filed on Monday in federal court in San Francisco, was brought by two California residents who seek to represent a nationwide class of consumers who bought allegedly defective Toyota vehicles.According to the complaint, Toyota’s Prius, Camry, Land Cruiser and Lexus vehicles have all been manufactured with “sub-standard�� steel, aluminum and copper.The plaintiffs allege that Toyota and Kobe Steel both violated federal and state consumer protection laws by claiming that the vehicles complied with U.S. quality standards.“We have not grasped the whole content of the case and we are now looking into the matter,�� a Kobe Steel spokesman said on Wednesday.Toyota declined to comment on the lawsuit.In a special order in November, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked 29 automakers, including Toyota, to disclose any safety issues for any of their vehicles or engines containing products supplied by Kobe Steel.The regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what data it had received in response and whether there was any evidence of faulty materials in Toyota cars.Monday’s 40-page lawsuit outlines the ways in which the companies allegedly concealed poor metal quality. It demands compensatory and punitive damages of an unspecified amount.According to the complaint, at least six Toyota car models sold or leased to U.S. consumers were manufactured with substandard metal from Kobe Steel. Plaintiffs said the metal could impact vehicle safety and performance.Toyota had the duty to disclose any defective vehicle components because it has consistently marketed its automobiles as safe, functional and reliable, the lawsuit says.Kobe and Toyota had superior knowledge and access to the facts, the lawsuit alleged, giving rise to fraud by concealment claims.Four individuals in Canada who bought cars that use Kobe’s products have already brought class-action lawsuits seeking unspecified damages against Kobe and it subsidiaries.Kobe is also undergoing a separate U.S. Justice Department probe.A company executive said on Tuesday that it is fully cooperating with the U.S. probe, but it was hard to predict how it would develop.	-3.42782314
EditorsNote: adds quotes, agateBlaney battles back from penalty for victory at BristolBy Chris Knight, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeBRISTOL, Tenn. -- A spin with four laps to go in Wednesday night’s UNOH 200 at Bristol Motor Speedway proved to be the saving grace for Brad Keselowski Racing’s Ryan Blaney, who grabbed the lead on a green-white-checkered restart to win his first race of the 2015 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series season.Blaney recovered from an early race penalty for jumping a restart to find himself closing on leader Matt Crafton with five laps remaining. When Ty Dillon spun on Lap 196, it triggered the final caution of the night and the opportunity for Blaney to steal Crafton’s thunder. On the final restart, Crafton’s truck sputtered, failing to come up to speed, allowing Blaney to take off and seal his fourth career NCWTS victory.“It feels really good,�� Blaney said. “I’m proud of everyone on this No. 29 team. I’ve had a chance to drive this truck four times this year and we’ve come really, really close every single time and to finally get it to Victory Lane, my last start of the year for this truck, it really means a lot to get Chad (Kendrick, crew chief) and Brad (Keselowski, team owner) back to Victory Lane.“To do that in that fashion coming from a lap down and being able to drive through the field like that says a lot about our race team and a lot about what as an organization we can do.”Keystone Light Pole Award winner Kyle Busch’s slow start allowed outside pole-sitter Blaney to steal the lead early by the exit of Turn 1, controlling the field through the first caution on Lap 31 for a spin in Turn 2.On the restart, Blaney roared away from the field, but a few laps later, NASCAR black-flagged him on Lap 37 for jumping the restart, forcing a pass-through penalty, giving the lead to Cole Custer.Busch, who restarted fifth, methodically worked his way forward and attempted to take the lead away from the young NASCAR Camping World Truck Series winner, but Custer kept Busch at bay through the race’s second caution on Lap 79 for debris in Turn 1.Busch and Johnny Sauter would trade the lead following the caution, before Custer returned to the top spot on lap 90.A more than 1.5-second lead for Custer would be erased when Ray Black Jr. and Caleb Holman crashed in Turn 4 on lap 112.With darkening skies overhead and the threat of rain approaching the World’s Fastest Half-Mile, a majority of the teams elected to stay out. Despite his best efforts, Crafton tried to snatch the lead away from the JR Motorsports driver, but to no avail.Custer slowly saw Crafton become a diminishing factor in his rear-view mirror until he hit heavy lap traffic with 50 laps remaining. That’s when Spencer Gallagher spun in Turns 3 and 4, and Custer found himself trapped in the high-line and collided with Gallagher.Heavy front-end damage sent the No. 00 Chevrolet to pit road for repairs, eliminating the NASCAR Next driver from competition. As the accident happened, Crafton slipped by on the inside and took the lead -- which he held until the green-white-checkered restart that lost him the race.While under yellow for the fourth time of the night, heavy rain began to fall, causing a red flag for 45 minutes, 50 seconds while the track was dried.Next up for the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series is the Aug. 30 race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park for the third-annual Chevrolet Silverado 250.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Global automakers seeking emergency financing for their plants in Brazil have reached an impasse with several state and private banks, after the lenders demanded collateral from the parent companies, two sources told Reuters.The sources said the carmakers have balked at the request, delaying any decision on the billions of reais sought by automakers.Brazil is South America's largest auto producer and a major base of operations for General Motors Co GM.N, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Ford Motor Co F.N, which are requesting a bailout for their local units to weather the crisis stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.An auto industry source familiar with the negotiations said the companies still hope a deal can be made before May 8, when Brazil’s auto industry association will hold a regular news conference to discuss production figures.The Brazilian government has been trying to coordinate bailout talks with industries including airlines and autos through its National Development Bank (BNDES) and other state-controlled banks like Banco do Brasil SA BBAS3.SA, but also including several listed banks with no government ownership.The auto sector started the talks with banks and government demanding a 100 billion-reais ($19.10 billion) bailout. Reuters reported earlier that sources doubted the package will reach that amount.The automakers, which also include Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Hyundai in addition to France's Renault RENA.PA and Peugeot PEUP.PA, have stated they require urgent loans to make payroll and to keep alive what they describe as a crucial supply chain that contributes a significant chunk of Brazil's GDP.The government and the banks, on the other hand, want to compel the carmakers to share any loans with their suppliers and dealers, who also employ many people, one of the sources said. Also included among the banks are Banco Bradesco SA BBDC4.SA, Itau Unibanco SA ITUB4.SA and Banco Santander Brasil SA SANB3.SABNDES is also in talks to help airlines with 10 billion reais in aid, but discussions have stalled because of the Brazilian government’s request that the loans be convertible into equity.The auto industry source said the carmakers are seeking loans with low interest rates and long maturity dates, and with some form of local collateral.The other source said banks do not consider auto plants in Brazil particularly appealing as collateral, saying they would be hard to sell if necessary.Ford recently tried but failed to sell its oldest plant in Brazil, in the state of Sao Paulo. It has since shut down and employees have been laid off.	2.314103083
EditorsNote: Changes P.J. to PJGerald Green drilled a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer, and the Houston Rockets extended their winning streak to 11 games with a 104-103 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday at Toyota Center.Rookie Josh Jackson sank a pullup jumper with 1.4 seconds left to push Phoenix back in front after Rockets guard James Harden hit a game-tying 3-pointer with 12.2 seconds left. Harden had been 0-for-7 from behind the arc before momentarily knotting the score at 101-101.After Jackson scored the last of his team-high 27 points, Green took the inbounds pass from Trevor Ariza and buried his jumper in front of the Houston bench. He was mobbed by teammates as game officials reviewed the shot. The Rockets completed an unbeaten homestand and extended their winning streak at Toyota Center to 18 games.The Suns dropped their 14th consecutive game in heartbreaking fashion. Troy Daniels made seven 3-pointers and tallied 23 points while Tyler Ulis had 16 points and 12 assists for Phoenix.Harden finished with 28 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds while PJ Tucker chipped in 18 points. Green added 15 points, shooting 4 of 11 on threes.Joe Johnson was instrumental in pulling the Rockets back from the depths, scoring 14 points in the third quarter primarily on post ups. The Suns had opened a 21-point lead at 71-50 on the third of three consecutive 3-pointers from Daniels before Johnson led the Rockets�� comeback.What was a sluggish first quarter for the Rockets turned downright ugly in the second. Houston missed five free throws and converted only six field goals in the opening period yet trailed by only three points at the end of the quarter.When Tucker drilled a corner trey midway through the frame, the Rockets trailed 37-34 and appeared poised to fashion a rally into the lead.Instead, the Suns reeled off a 12-0 burst, with Jackson recording seven points during that run.Houston managed just two baskets down the stretch of the half while the Suns kept firing away, and after two Ulis threes and a Jackson basket through a foul, Phoenix led by 17 at the intermission.--Field Level Media	3.467888459
Oct 1 (Reuters) - Auto sales in Canada fell in September from a year earlier with new light vehicle sales in the country down 3.7%, according to industry data released on Tuesday.Light vehicle sales in September fell to 166,488 units from 172,974 units, a year earlier.The fall in September numbers comes after a brief respite in August, when sales rose slightly following seventeen months of declines.September performance lined up fairly closely with year-to-date results, down 4.1% with 1.50 million units sold, falling from 1.57 million units in 2018, according to a report released by DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, a market research firm that tracks the sector.Total sales of passenger cars dropped 18% in September, while light truck sales rose 1.9%.In total, a dozen reporting brands noted sales increases in the month but key losses among higher volume brands such as General Motors, Nissan and Toyota resulted in an overall decline, the report added.

Wisconsin native Paul Menard wins in nail-biting Road America finishBy Chris KnightNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed for The Sports XchangeELKHART LAKE, Wis. -- The decision to compete in Saturday afternoon’s NASCAR XFINITY Series sixth annual Road America 180 Fired Up by Johnsonville at Road America (Wis.) paid off in a huge way for Paul Menard who scored his third career XFINITY victory at his hometown track.Menard, a native of Eau Claire, Wis., started eighth and saw a decision to stay out after pitting on Lap 24 work to his advantage as he edged out a relentless Ryan Blaney by 0.573 seconds at the 14-turn road course. After the contest, Menard said had the race extended a lap further, he would not have collected his first XFINITY win since Michigan International Speedway last June.“I’ve been really fortunate to win at some of the coolest tracks -- Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Road America is right there,�� Menard said. “These guys called a great race. We didn’t have the fastest car. We had a really good short run car. We really burned off the rear tires as we ran, but the Richmond Water Heaters/Menards Chevrolet was fast and (crew chief Danny) Stockman made a hell of a call at the end.”If wondering about running out of fuel wasn’t enough, Menard also had to fend off a hard-charging Blaney.“I was definitely concerned,�� added Menard on both circumstances. “I was saving as much as I could under caution, but then when we fired off I was just chattering the left rear tire really bad. It took a couple of laps for it to come in, then the (No.) 22 started burning his stuff up, but it just didn’t fire off very good in the end, but it came to us.”After inclement weather forced the cancelation of Coors Light Pole qualifying, Ben Rhodes earned the top starting spot based upon turning the fastest lap at the 4.05-mile road course in the first XFINITY Series practice session Friday afternoon.Rhodes, a NASCAR Next alum, would find himself under pressure from the drop of the green flag when JR Motorsports teammate Chase Elliott made the move for the lead in Turn 1.Quickly, though, the field would be under the first full-course caution of the day when Tomy Drissi found himself stuck in the gravel trap in Turn 5.Racing resumed on Lap 4 with Elliott checking out from the field and before the first round of green-flag pit stops. The reigning champion stretched his lead to over 10 seconds, when he relinquished the top spot on Lap 11 for a routine pit stop.Championship contender Ty Dillon inherited the lead when Elliott pitted. Dillon, who finished 10th, stretched his fuel run an extra lap to earn a crucial bonus point toward the championship picture.When pit stops cycled through, Elliott reclaimed the point on Lap 16 and built a 13.7-second lead over second-place Brian Scott at the halfway mark. On Lap 22, the second caution waved for fluid on the track, erasing Elliott’s substantial advantage.Despite half of the field electing to come to pit road for service behind them, Elliott and his JRM team stood firm on their plan and stayed out. On the restart, Elliott withstood a challenge from Brian Scott and Ryan Blaney, but in Turn 14 and through the front stretch, Scott mounted the pressure and made the move on Elliott to take the lead on Lap 27.Unable to make it to the end on fuel, Scott pitted under green on Lap 29 handing the lead to defending race winner Brendan Gaughan. Three laps later, though, Gaughan pitted, handing the lead to hometown hero Menard, who pitted during the second caution with 13 laps remaining.Planning to stay out till the end, Menard in saving mode purposely gave up the lead to Blake Koch who led with 10 laps remaining when pole-sitter Rhodes found himself stuck in the gravel trap in Turn 7 issuing the third full course caution. During the extended caution, Koch lost power putting Menard back at the point.On the Lap 41 restart, Menard withstood challenges from Darrell Wallace Jr. and Blaney to seal the win in his 197th career start.Next up for the NASCAR XFINITY Series is a trip to the track dubbed “Too Tough To Tame�� at Darlington (S.C.)

* Toyota becomes 12th Games sponsor* Car maker is the third Japanese company to sponsor Olympics (Adds more quotes, details)BERLIN, March 13 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corporation has joined the group of leading sponsors of the Olympic Games in an agreement that runs until 2024, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday.The car maker becomes the first company of its kind to join 11 other global brands on the IOC’s top sponsorship programme (TOP) in a deal reported to be just under $1 billion.Toyota, the world’s biggest car manufacturer by volume, is also the third Japanese company to join TOP, after Panasonic and Bridgestone as the Olympics prepare to go to Tokyo in 2024.Both have also signed up to 2024.“Toyota is the world leader in its field and this partnership signifies a strong commitment to the future of the IOC and the Olympic movement,�� IOC President Thomas Bach said in the Japanese capital.The contract will officially run from 2017 to 2024 but Toyota, the third sponsor to commit to 2024, has marketing rights in Japan with immediate effect.“Long-term partnerships are the backbone of our commercial programmes and they enable the financial security of the entire Olympic movement,�� IOC marketing chief Tsunekazu Takeda, who is also Vice-President of the Tokyo 2020 Games, said.Although it does not reveal contract details of its sponsorship agreements, the deals with its top sponsors generate more than $100 million per quadrennium.“We will do everything possible to fulfil our new role in The Olympic Partner Programme and to justify the trust that the IOC has placed in us,�� said Toyota President Akio Toyoda.“The addition of the mobility category to The Olympic Partner Programme is important recognition for our entire industry.”Other major sponsors, including McDonald’s, Samsung, Coca-Cola and Atos, have signed up until 2020 or beyond.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Can robots help solve the problem of an aging population in growing need of physical help but lacking the money and carers to provide it?Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp thinks they can, if they are equipped to mimic the touch and actions of a carer located far away.Toyota’s latest humanoid robot, T-HR3, demonstrated on Wednesday at Tokyo’s International Robot Exhibition, is controlled remotely by a human operator.Goggles let the operator see what the robot sees, gloves let them feel what the robot touches - enough for the operator, via the robot, to pour a drink or carry out other delicate manual tasks, all by remote control.“You can look after someone when you’re not there, or care for someone while you’re working at home,�� said the manager of Toyota Motor’s Humanoid Robot Group, Tomohisa Moridaira.He noted that the carer can also take advantage of the robot’s extra muscle: “People who are not strong can do heavy work from a remote place.”Another growing care need, keeping the elderly mobile and active, is the job of the ‘Orthobot��, manufactured by Suncall.A pack worn on the body controls the movements of a long brace that helps the leg to bend and stretch for walking.“We want to break the barrier of people not wanting go outside because they can’t walk. We want them to have a good social life,�� said Suncall’s Rei Takahashi.About 130,000 people are expected to visit the International Robot Exhibition, which runs until Saturday.	0.2887934071

CANBERRA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Australian carmaker GM Holden, a division of U.S. manufacturer General Motors, on Thursday said it would cut up to 140 jobs from its Adelaide car plant in the latest of a series of job losses in Australia’s automotive industry.The job cuts come a week after the Australian arm of Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corp cut 350 jobs at its Melbourne operations due to an ongoing downturn in production, blaming the high Australian dollar.GM Holden’s managing director, Mike Devereux, said the high Australian dollar had hurt Holden exports, forcing the company to trim production costs.“At the current exchange rate, we won’t be able to realise further growth in our export programmes, so the shift changes allow us to maintain production levels and do it more efficiently,�� Devereux said.The Australian dollar has traded at record highs above parity with the U.S. dollar over the past year, putting a strain on manufacturing exports.Australia’s three car manufacturers, Toyota Australia, Ford’s Australian division, and Holden, made 242,941 vehicles in 2010 and exported 94,000 vehicles. The industry employs about 50,000 people.Holden made 90,000 vehicles in Australia in 2011, up 35 percent on the previous year and Devereux said Holden would maintain current production while cutting one shift from its assembly line.Australia’s treasurer, Wayne Swan, said the government remained committed to helping carmakers who are struggling with a global downturn in demand and a strong Australian currency.“We are absolutely determined to have in this country a viable and competitive auto industry,�� Swan told reporters in Queensland.Despite hefty government subsidies and tariff support, the industry has struggled to maintain manufacturing jobs, with the Australian arm of Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors Corp closing its car plants in 2008.Toyota, which employs around 4,700 people in Australia, had seen vehicle production drop 36 percent in four years from 149,000 in 2007 to an expected 95,000 in 2012.Toyota Australia’s chief executive, Max Yasuda, told the Australian Financial Review newspaper that Australia’s workplace laws were another factor that prevented the company from responding to changed business conditions.“When you go to the factory, even with my own eyes, I can see there are so many things we can improve. But somehow this improvement is being blocked by some element. One of the elements is work practice,�� he said.Yasuda was particularly critical of the ability of workers to call in sick on a Friday.“If you don’t work on Friday it is a long weekend, right?�� he said. “In this country, in our factory, they just don’t come in and later on they ask for sick leave. For me, this is difficult to understand, why is this allowed?��	6.572215663

DETROIT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - In an escalation of the auto industry’s war of words over future green technologies, a senior Toyota Motor Corp executive singled out Elon Musk and other rival executives on Tuesday and made a bold prediction for its hydrogen car.Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice president for automative operations, said in a speech that he believed a hydrogen fuel cell car it plans to launch next year could eventually be as successful as its pioneering Prius gasoline-electric hybrid.Carter said “naysayers�� who have spoken out against the technology would be proven wrong and referred to Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc, Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan Motor Co, and former Volkswagen executive Jonathan Browning by name.“Personally I don’t really care what Elon and Carlos and Jonathan have to say about fuel cells. It’s very reminiscent of 1998, 1999 when we first introduced the Prius,�� Carter said at a conference held in conjunction with the Detroit auto show.The comments underscore just how big the stakes are in the race to take the lead in the next generation green car.While Toyota is investing heavily in fuel cells, others such as Nissan, Volkswagen and Tesla are betting on electric vehicles as the next big thing while publically questioning whether hydrogen could ever develop into a practical automotive fuel.At the Los Angeles auto show in November, Browning, who was then chief of Volkswagen’s U.S. operations, ruffled feathers by saying electric was a more viable technology because it was a lot easier for consumers to find electric sockets than hydrogen stations.Toyota’s Carter addressed the infrastructure issue on Tuesday, arguing that the number of hydrogen fuelling stations would grow in time, helped by private-public partnerships such as the one established in the state of California.By placing stations in better locations, Carter estimated that if all cars in California were running on hydrogen that the state’s fuelling needs could be met with 15 percent of the nearly 10,000 gasoline stations currently in operation.Fuel cell cars convert hydrogen to electricity, emit only water vapour and have a similar range to conventional petrol-driven cars.Toyota believes that makes them the best next-generation technology to suceed the hybrid vehicle, of which it has cumulatively sold nearly 6 million since the first Prius rolled off the production line.“Ten years from now, I have a hunch our fuel cell vehicle will be viewed in similar terms. We truly believe it has the same potential as the first Prius,�� Carter said.	-3.599229932
* Truck sales bolster overall sales in 2013* Honda Civic again most popular car, Ford’s F150 truck top vehicle* Luxury brands also show strengthTORONTO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Canadians bought more vehicles in 2013 than in any year since 2002, as consumers brushed off high debt and a slow economic recovery to buy trucks and luxury models, though icy weather limited December purchases, numbers released on Friday showed.Industry-wide sales grew 3.8 percent to 113,036 vehicles in December, bringing total sales for the year to 1.74 million, a 4 percent increase, according to independent auto industry firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, which collates manufacturer data.Truck sales jumped 6.9 percent while passenger car sales were almost flat for the year, with the discrepancy even wider in December with truck sales up 14.4 percent and car sales shrinking by 9.7 percent.Ford Motor Co’s Canadian arm sold fewer vehicles in December than a year earlier but held its position as the country’s best-selling automaker in 2013 as truck sales helped it notch overall growth of 2.7 percent, the company said.Chrysler claimed second place, with a 4.7 percent jump in December sales and 6.6 percent growth for the year, helped by record sales of its Ram trucks.“Overall 2013 goes down as the year of the truck,�� DesRosiers wrote. “The F150 alone outsells other full-line nameplates including Kia, Mazda and Nissan.”General Motors Co meanwhile posted the biggest gain in December sales, up 17 percent, while taking third place for the year on 4 percent growth. Its Cadillac brand notched 44.6 percent annual sales gains for its best-ever Canadian sales.Toyota Motor Corp said its luxury Lexus brand had a marquee year that helped the company notch 1.7 percent annual growth and cemented its fourth-place position.Other luxury brands including Land Rover, Porsche and Jaguar recorded double-digit annual growth.Ford said it was their best year for Canadian sales since 1997, with the F-Series pickup truck leading all vehicle sales for the fourth straight year. The company’s Fusion and Escape models also recorded their best-ever sales.Honda Motor Co Ltd said its Civic was Canada’s top-selling car for the 16th straight year. Honda’s monthly sales nudged slightly higher overall to 13,316, but grew 10.4 percent for the year to 164,236.Ford’s total vehicle sales in December slipped 4.2 percent to 16,161, as it sold fewer cars than a year ago. For the year, it sold 283,588 vehicles, an increase of 2.7 percent.Chrysler, which is owned by Italy’s Fiat SpA, sold 15,445 vehicles in December and 260,015 in all of 2013, while GM sold 17,036 vehicles in December and 234,944 in the year. Toyota sold 12,348 vehicles in December and 195,360 in 2013.Ford said in September that it would invest C$700 million ($659 million) in its Oakville assembly plant as North American demand surged to pre-recession levels.December sales in the much larger U.S. market came up short of expectations, but 2014 sales are forecast to keep outpacing the overall U.S. economy recovery from recession.	-6.174586003
(Adds details, context)BEIJING, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Dongfeng Motor Corporation and China FAW Group Corp said on Friday they will build a joint innovation centre, a move that brings China’s two oldest automakers together after they swapped top executives in 2015.The companies signed an agreement on Friday that will see them collaborate in five areas including fuel cell technology, smart connectivity and testing facilities. The companies did not disclose financial terms.In 2015, former FAW president Zhu Yanfeng replaced Dongfeng’s chairman Xu Ping, who was in turn named the chairman of FAW Group.The move sparked wide speculation that the two companies could merge, sending up shares of listed subsidiaries FAW Car Co and Tianjin FAW Xiali Automobile Co.The companies have struggled to establish independent brands that can compete with foreign manufacturers, although both have highly profitable joint ventures with global automakers.FAW has joint ventures with Toyota Motor and Volkswagen AG, while Dongfeng has JVs with Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co.

TOKYO, May 1 (Reuters) - Strong demand from U.S. dealers has prompted Subaru carmaker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd to consider developing a new large SUV that would be made and sold in its biggest market, a spokesman said on Thursday.Fuji Heavy is considering making a successor to the Tribeca SUV, which can seat up to seven people, spokesman Fusao Watanabe said. The company ended manufacturing the Tribeca in January at its sole U.S. plant in Indiana, which also assembles the Camry sedan for Toyota Motor Corp. Toyota owns 16.5 percent of Fuji Heavy.Details on the new vehicle have yet to be decided, Watanabe said, adding that it would make sense for the company to locally manufacture a vehicle it intends to sell only in the United States.Fuji Heavy, which in 2013 saw U.S. sales rise 26 percent to a record 424,683 vehicles, is in the process of expanding production capacity at the Indiana plant.Fuji Heavy said in May 2013 that it plans to invest $400 million to boost the Indiana plant’s annual capacity by around 100,000 vehicles by end-2016.The plant currently has an annual capacity of 270,000 vehicles, of which 100,000 is devoted to Toyota’s Camry. Subaru plans to expand that to 300,000 vehicles by around mid-2013.Meanwhile, in late 2013, Fuji Heavy said it received notice from Toyota that the world’s biggest carmaker may cease production of the Camry at the Indiana plant in 2017.Details of production plans for the Indiana plant are expected to be announced on May 9 when Fuji Heavy releases its mid-term plan as well as its full-year earnings results.The Nikkei business daily reported earlier on Thursday that Toyota and Fuji Heavy will agree as early as this month to terminate Camry production at the Indiana plant and that Toyota could shift that Camry assembly to other factories, including its own Kentucky plant where it already makes the Camry.It also reported that Fuji Heavy will develop a new SUV for the U.S. market, which it will manufacture at the Indiana plant, utilising the capacity that is currently devoted for the Camry.“Toyota is in talks with Fuji Heavy over the setup of the Camry production at SIA (Subaru of Indiana Automotive), but nothing has been decided,�� Toyota spokesman Naoki Sumino said.	3.845803335
(Reuters) - Ivory Coast's government signed an agreement on Thursday with Toyota 7203.T to build a vehicle assembly plant in the West African nation, the office of Ivorian Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly said in a statement. Faced with stagnant sales in developed economies, automakers including Toyota, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, BMW BMWG.DE, and Nissan 7201.T are seeking to break into Africa, considered one of the world's last untapped markets for new cars.Thursday's agreement was signed at a Japan-Africa development conference in Yokohama, Japan, by Gon Coulibaly and Ichiro Kashitani, CEO of Toyota Tsusho 8015.T, a unit of the automotive and industrial group.The statement did not give details on the number or type of vehicles Toyota will produce in Ivory Coast, but it said the process for establishing the plant would be launched before the end of the year.As part of its push into the continent, Toyota Tsusho acquired French automobile retailer CFAO, which operates in 35 countries in Africa, in 2016. Toyota already produces cars in South Africa, which has a well-developed auto industry.VW and Nissan have also set up operations in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana or have pledged to do so.

TOKYO, March 9 (Reuters) - The alleged illegal drug use by a Hino Red Dolphins player has forced Japan’s Top League to suspend all matches in the rugby union competition until April, officials said on Monday.The latest suspension follows the postponement of the last two rounds of the competition due to the coronavirus outbreak.Hino’s New Zealand-born forward Joel Everson was arrested last week for cocaine use, leading the club to cancel all their remaining matches for the rest of the season.“We think an in-depth measure is needed,�� read a statement from Top League.“Rugby consists of five core values; dignity, passion, unity, discipline and respect.“If any of these is missing, then it’s not rugby. And this incident violates most of the core values.”The Top League apologised to its fans in the statement and said it would be looking to ‘restore trust�� in the wake of the incident.Last year, two players from Top League side Toyota Verblitz were convicted of illegal drug possession.The coronavirus outbreak has also seen the start of Japan’s professional baseball league pushed back and the country’s domestic soccer matches postponed.More than 110,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 3,800 have died from it, according to a Reuters tally.Fourteen deaths have been reported in Japan from 1,190 cases.

* GM to stop car manufacturing in Indonesia* GM Indonesia to shutter assembly plant, axe 500 jobs* Part of broader emerging market restructuring* GM Indonesia chief Michael Dunne to leave by end-Feb* GM to reposition Chevrolet as SUV brand in SE Asia (Adds GM comment on costs of the plan)By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING, Feb 26 (Reuters) - General Motors will stop making GM-branded cars in Indonesia, a battleground for global automakers, closing an assembly plant, axing some 500 jobs and shifting its focus to sport utility vehicles (SUVs).The U.S. auto giant, which was the first to set up a car assembly plant in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy eight decades ago, is effectively calling time on its attempt to wrestle market share from dominant Japanese rivals, led by Toyota Motor .GM Executive Vice President Stefan Jacoby, who oversees markets beyond the Americas, Europe and China, acknowledged GM got it wrong in going head-to-head with the Japanese in a market he dubs their “backyard��.The move is part of a broader repositioning of the Chevrolet brand across Southeast Asia, emphasizing its American heritage for SUVs such as the Captiva and Trailblazer. The retreat also comes as GM drives into Indonesia with its Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp.The partners plan to set up a manufacturing facility near Jakarta for their no-frills Wuling brand, but aren’t interested in taking over GM’s existing Bekasi plant, a person close to the joint venture said.GM tried to take on Japanese rivals by locally producing its Chevrolet Spin, a strategic, small “people mover�� van that has proved a winner in Brazil. But the Spin was too costly to make to be profitable in Indonesia as most of the parts had to be imported.The Spin sold from around $12,000 and competed with Toyota’s Avanza. But it failed to take off as GM had hoped, making the production plant at Bekasi, just outside Jakarta, a financial burden. Production last year was less than a quarter of Bekasi’s annual capacity of 40,000 vehicles. GM sold just 8,412 Spin cars in Indonesia last year, and exported nearly 3,000.“We could not ramp up Spin production to boost the volume as we had expected ... although the product was really good,�� Jacoby told Reuters. “The logistics chain of the Spin was too complex; we had low volume so we could not localize the car accordingly, and from the cost point of view we were just not competitive.”GM will stop making the Spin in Indonesia by end-June and shutter the Bekasi factory, which employs around 500 people. The restructuring will leave GM Indonesia as only a sales unit.A GM spokesman said there were no details to announce about the financial impact of the move and more information would be provided when first-quarter results are announced in April.The overhaul aims to turn GM Indonesia “not only into profitability, but into a sustainable business model,�� Jacoby said.GM’s decision to dial back its solo presence in a market of 240 million people, where fewer than four in every 100 own a car, comes as global automakers retool their strategies for the world’s big emerging markets, including Russia and India.Despite its long presence in Indonesia, GM sold fewer than 11,000 vehicles there last year, giving it a market share of below 1 percent, according to LMC Automotive. By contrast, Toyota and its Daihatsu affiliate sold more than 578,000 vehicles. Toyota and other Japanese makers together control more than 90 percent of the market.GM Indonesia chief Michael Dunne is expected to leave his post within days, and will be replaced on an interim basis by Pranav Bhatt, chief financial officer for GM Indonesia. Dunne and Bhatt were not immediately available to comment.The Bekasi plant was opened in 1995, but shut a decade later as Japanese brands tightened their grip on the market. It was re-opened two years ago as part of the Spin revival bid. (Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Ian Geoghegan and Peter Galloway)	5.30398168
(Adds analyst comments)BEIJING, Aug 11 (Reuters) - China’s overall vehicles sales grew 6.2 percent in July from a year earlier to 1.97 million vehicles, showing that the world’s largest auto market continues to rebound from the weakness it saw in April and May, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Friday.In June, vehicle sales volume rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier. It was down 2.2 percent and 0.1 percent respectively in April and May.In the first seven months of the year, sales grew 4.1 percent from the same period last year to 15.3 million vehicles, the association said at a briefing in Beijing.Analysts and company officials attributed the relatively strong sales last month in part to higher incentive levels.“We’re losing a bit of steam in basic demand, but incentives are giving the market some support,�� said James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific chief of consultancy IHS Markit Automotive.Still, individually some car brands tried their best to keep from relying on discounts and other incentives, which sap margins.A senior Toyota sales executive who oversees both Toyota and Lexus brands noted that market fundamentals are still “sound�� in smaller or lower-tier inland markets.“We’re shifting our focus more and more on lower-tier, smaller markets, and that effort seems to be working for us,�� said the executive, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to reporters.Toyota’s sales in July rose 11.4 percent from a year earlier to 108,900 vehicles.In January, CAAM predicted sales would rise 5 percent this year, slowing from 13.7 percent in 2016, citing the rollback of a tax incentive for small-engine cars and economic pressures.Green cars saw brisk sales in China last month.Sales of so-called new energy vehicles �� all electric battery cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles �� increased 55.2 percent in July from a year earlier to 56,000 vehicles. New-energy vehicles sales totalled 251,000 vehicles during the first seven months of 2017, up 21.5 percent from a year ago.CAAM forecast sales of new-energy vehicles at about 700,000 vehicles this year.

"(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said Thursday it will furlough 1,500 workers at its U.S. assembly plant in Tennessee starting April 11 as the industry grapples with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.The German automaker said the temporary emergency furloughs for its production and maintenance workforce are expected to last no more than four weeks.The automaker said its “primary objective is to protect the financial health of Volkswagen for the benefit of our team as we address the emerging and ongoing impacts of the COVID-19.”VW said employees and production contractors at the plant have to date received full pay and benefits during the shutdown that began March 21.Automakers are facing a dramatic drop in sales in the United States, the world’s second-largest car market, after some states barred dealers from selling new cars while ""stay-at-home"" orders are in place. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI on Monday extended its shutdown of U.S. and Canadian plants until May 4.On Tuesday, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said they had furloughed thousands of workers at their U.S. operations.A spokesman for Honda, which employs about 18,400 workers at plants in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio, said the Japanese automaker would guarantee salaries through Sunday, having suspended operations on March 23. The plants will be closed through May 1.Nissan said it was temporarily laying off about 10,000 U.S. hourly workers effective April 6. It has suspended operations at its U.S. manufacturing facilities through late April due to the impact of the outbreak.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said this week it plans to reopen its North American auto plants on May 4, extending its current shutdown by two additional weeks. Toyota said it will stop paying salaries for 5,000 workers provided by outside agencies."	1.946231239
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will offer its cars in India on leases or shorter-term subscriptions, hoping to tap growing demand for private transport as travelers cut down on communal journeys in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Japanese automaker said on Tuesday it would offer leasing plans to corporate and retail customers of three to five years across its portfolio of cars - including the Glanza hatchback, Yaris sedan and Fortuner sport-utility vehicle - for as little as 21,000 rupees ($281) a month.Naveen Soni, senior vice president, sales and service at the carmaker’s India unit, said the need for safe transport was growing and leasing or subscription models offered a more cost-effective solution than buying a car.So far, leasing and subscription services in India have largely focussed on the higher end of the auto market and therefore make up a fraction of the overall numbers, said Soni.“The lower end of the market is where the bulk is,�� he said, adding that was where Toyota would also focus.Toyota's competitors in India, such as Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, have formed partnerships to offer similar services, as carmakers look to boost revenues amid the pandemic.Toyota’s India unit has formed a separate team to drive the business and it will partner with its Japanese parent’s global mobility services brand, KINTO, as well as ALD Automotive and SMAS Auto Leasing.	-0.7100066563
(This April 9 story corrects start date of production shutdown to March 23, with furloughs starting on March 30.)SAO PAULO (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N plans to keep its Brazilian factories shut down for at least 60 more days due to the coronavirus crisis, the company said Thursday, as the final batch of unionized workers voted on the automaker's proposal. GM’s plants in Brazil have been shuttered since March 23. On March 30 the company put its workers on furlough, but kept their pay intact as it made employees use up vacation days.But as the pandemic has worsened globally and holiday allotments have dried up, GM has had to look for more drastic measures in South America’s top auto producer. Now its factories in Brazil, where for several years Chevrolet has been the country’s best selling brand, will be shut down at least until mid June.The timeline puts Brazil behind the schedules set by automakers in Europe, where companies have said they might begin building vehicles by the end of this month. In The United States, automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T are hoping to restart production in early May.To be sure, GM has not set reopening start dates elsewhere in the world.Brazil has more coronavirus cases than any country in Latin America and its right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticized for minimizing the severity of the disease.GM said all its Brazilian workers except for one have agreed to the shutdown and for a plan to cut salaries by up to 25%. The remaining union, based in Sao Jose dos Campos in Sao Paulo state, will finish voting on the proposal on Thursday night.If the crisis does not allow workers to resume auto production within 60 days, GM may extend the shutdown to 90 days, according to a document shared with workers and seen by Reuters.	1.946231239
BANGKOK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Thailand’s total domestic car sales are expected at 800,000 units this year, up 4.06 percent from 2016, Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Tuesday.Toyota, which commands about a third of the Thai market, predicts its own 2017 auto sales in the Southeast Asian nation at 265,000 vehicles, up 8.1 percent from last year, it said at a news conference.Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Thai unit, said domestic car sales would be helped by new models, improved private investment and the end of a five-year restriction on people selling cars bought under a government subsidy scheme.Thailand is a regional production and export hub for the world’s top carmakers, and the sector accounts for around 10 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.

HANOI, May 9 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s car sales fell slightly in April, declining 4 percent from a year earlier to 20,557 units, according to data released by the Vietnam Automotive Manufacturers Association (VAMA).Sales in April were 2 percent lower than in March, VAMA said in a statement.Toyota remained the leading brand last month, with sales rising 3 percent from a year earlier to 4,234 units.Truong Hai (Thaco) group, the local assembler and distributor of brands such as Kia, Mazda, Peugeot and Hyundai and a significant player in the commercial vehicle segment, reported a 0.5 percent rise in group sales to 8,679 units in April.Ford’s sales were 47 percent lower at 1,359 units in April while Honda sales rose four-fold to 2,815 units.For the first four months of this year, total car sales in the country fell 2 percent from a year earlier to 79,115 units, VAMA said.

WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and major automakers on Monday confirmed they had finalized binding agreements to cut vehicle emissions in the state, defying the Trump administration’s push for weaker curbs on tailpipe pollution.The agreements with carmakers including Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Co and BMW AG , were first announced in July 2019 as voluntary measures prompting anger from U.S. President Donald Trump.A month later, the Justice Department opened an antitrust probe into the agreements. The government ended the investigation without action.The Trump administration in March finalized a rollback of U.S. vehicle emissions standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That is far weaker than the 5% annual increases in the discarded rules adopted under President Barack Obama.The 50-page California agreements, which extend through 2026, are less onerous than the standards finalized by the Obama administration but tougher than the Trump administration standards. The automakers have also agreed to electric vehicle commitments.Volvo Cars, owned by China’s Geely Holdings, said in March it planned to join the automakers agreeing to the California requirements. It has also finalized its agreement.The settlement agreements say California and automakers agreed to resolve “potential legal disputes concerning the authority of CARB�� and other states that have adopted California’s standards.In May, a group of 23 U.S. states led by California and some major cities, challenged the Trump vehicle emissions rule.Other major automakers like General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Toyota Motor Corp did not join the California agreement.Those companies also sided with the Trump administration in a separate lawsuit over whether the federal government can strip California of the right to set zero emission vehicle requirements.Ford said the “final agreement will reduce emissions in our vehicles at a more stringent rate, support and incentivize the production of electrified products, and create regulatory certainty.”BMW said “by setting these long-term, predictable, and achievable standards, we have the regulatory certainty that is necessary for long-term planning that will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but ultimately benefit consumers as well.�� (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Tom Brown)	-0.7936507937
SHANGHAI, April 20 (Reuters) - China is warming to gasoline-electric hybrid cars as it tackles an addiction to fossil fuels, and local car makers are finally heeding the call and entering a niche ‘green�� market dominated by Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp.Some automakers like state-owned SAIC Motor Corp and Brilliance Auto are developing the fuel-saving technology pioneered by Toyota on its Prius model two decades ago, and BYD Co , a Chinese battery and automaker part-owned by a Warren Buffett company, has developed its own gasoline-electric car technology.Throwing more subsidies at conventional hybrids could help kick-start China’s so-called ‘new-energy�� car policy, which has failed to gain traction. The policy aims to put half a million new-energy vehicles - defined as all-electric battery vehicles and heavily electrified “near all-electric�� plug-in hybrids - on the road by 2015 and 5 million by 2020.Last year, just 12,791 such vehicles were sold, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data, and industry experts reckon China has little hope of hitting those objectives unless the government redefines new-energy cars and embraces conventional hybrids and other alternative energy technologies.“China’s new energy push is in an embarrassing situation,�� said Wen Kaifavice director of Dongfeng Motor’s Technical Center. “I think the government may reclassify what is considered new energy carsnot by typebut by fuel efficiency.”�After all these years, people now realise that all-electric battery cars are unlikely to become mainstream over the next 10 years,�� said Peter Huang, associate director at IHS Automotive.Looking to wean China off fossil fuels and clean up its polluted air, Beijing has offered generous purchase incentives on new-energy cars in a 3-year programme that ended last year. As it comes to renew the programme, which industry insiders expect in the coming weeks, the government is thought likely to increase subsidies for hybrids.Handouts for those buying hybrid cars “will likely be significantly higher�� than they are now, a senior executive at a major state-owned automaker told Reuters. In the previous programme, Beijing offered a 3,000 yuan ($490) rebate to drivers buying a new gas-electric hybrid car, way below the 60,000 yuan handouts on all-electric battery cars.“The government has to change the policy. What has happened is they can’t spend the money budgeted for all-electric cars because few people are buying them. People are not motivated to buy hybrids either as the subsidies are far from enough,�� said the state-owned auto company executive, who didn’t want to be named because of the sensitive nature of the matter.Jochem Heizmann, CEO of Volkswagen Group China, said “There’s a discrepancy between the (Chinese) government’s goals and actions. Over the next 10 years, plug-in hybrids have much better prospects to achieve a certain volume than (purely) electric cars.“The problem is that special infrastructure has to be organised in some public areas. For private individuals it’s really difficult to use the electric car. It will take a long time to get to a certain volume (with battery-powered cars),�� he told reporters in Shanghai on Friday.“ALL VERY COMPLICATED”Chinese media have reported that Miao Wei, head of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told delegates at last month’s National People’s Congress that the new-energy car rebate programme would likely include 16 categories based on a vehicle’s fuel efficiency - raising industry hopes that the government is ready to boost subsidies for conventional hybrids.“China’s hybrid vehicles have been gradually maturing and mainstream products have achieved 20 percent savings on fuel. Conventional hybrids are thus ready, and cleared the threshold for country-wide promotion,�� state media reported Miao as saying at a Congress session.Some media said other ministries had not yet been won over to the merits of adopting conventional hybrids aggressively.“I haven’t heard anything definite, it’s all very complicated,�� said an official at the semi-government China Automotive Technology &amp; Research Center (CATARC), a body that helps set vehicle standards and technical regulations, as well as product certification and industry planning.The city of Guangzhou, a key industrial hub in southern China with a population of 12.7 million, decided last year to offer a 10,000 yuan rebate to anyone buying a gas-electric hybrid car.The application of hybrid technology - propelling a vehicle by coupling a gasoline engine with an electric motor - began with Toyota in the 1990s, and has since been taken up by many automakers. Hybrids are particularly popular in the United States and Japan. Toyota alone has sold more than 5 million hybrids since launching the Prius in 1997.Among China’s leading carmakers, SAIC has said it will launch the Roewe 550 hybrid in the coming months, adding to its Roewe 750 hybrid which hit showrooms in 2011 and which is priced from 236,800 yuan. Brilliance Auto is set to mass produce its FSV, a so-called ‘mild hybrid�� car that uses stop-start technology - where the gasoline engine stops when the car is at a standstill and re-starts when the driver steps on the gas pedal. To date it has sold several hundred FSVs to fleet operators in Dalian and other cities. Great Wall Motor Co is also expected to put its first ‘green�� car, a cross-over hybrid, on the market in China next year.“We have been focusing mostly on hybrids because battery technology is not mature and the cost is too high,�� said Judy Zhu, a spokeswoman for SAIC.Whatever Beijing decides on incentives for conventional hybrids, non-Chinese manufacturers will benefit, too.Toyota last year more than quadrupled sales of its hybrids in China to around 17,000 cars, some made locally and others brought in from Japan. Beyond the Prius, Toyota has a hybrid Camry that it builds in China. Volume sales are relatively low as the hybrids are pricey, with the Prius, for example, starting at $37,200 due to high taxes on imported cars in China. To bring prices down, Toyota plans to produce key hybrid parts such as the electric motors and batteries in China by 2015.Japanese rival Honda Motor Co sold only 540 hybrid cars in China last year, but plans to start producing certain hybrid models in China as early as next year.	14.63066916
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said on Tuesday it will shut its global headquarters in Japan for 16 days through early May to contain the spread of the coronavirus, even though the government has permitted keeping workplaces open to get the economy running.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has allowed manufacturing plants to keep operating under a state of emergency that was declared this month and broadened last week, but Nissan and its rivals had already suspended output at many of their factories due to plummeting global demand.Nissan is the latest Japanese company to shutter its global headquarters to reduce the number of staff commuting, as the COVID-19 infections in the country increased to around 11,000 this week.Canon Inc 7751.T and Toshiba 6502.T also announced similar measures earlier this month.Nissan said that 15,000 employees at its headquarters in Yokohama and main R&amp;D centre in nearby Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture, would be required to take leave for 16 days from next Monday through Japan’s “Golden Week�� holiday that starts on May 4.Its headquarters would be closed to all but essential workers, a Nissan spokeswoman said, adding that those affected would receive “the majority�� of their full salaries during the period.She said the measures were aimed at keeping more than 90% of its employees away from its offices, up from 80% at the moment.Like many of its global rivals, Nissan has also shuttered most of its global production facilities in compliance with “shelter at home�� directives to contain the spread of the virus.Nissan stopped production at its Tochigi vehicle plant, which produces the Skyline sedan and Infiniti models, for much of this month, and plans to keep it closed for most of May.Its plant in Kyushu, southern Japan, will operate only the day shift during April and May and shut down completely for four days during that period.Nissan's bigger rival Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has said it expects to cut its domestic production by around 40% as it significantly reduced output at its Japanese plants starting earlier month.Honda Motor Co 7267.T also said it would stop production at some of its domestic plants next week, citing disruptions in its global supply chain. Most automakers are bracing for a big financial hit from the virus, as lockdowns in the United States and Europe have kept buyers out of dealerships. But Nissan’s sales and profits had been slumping even before the outbreak, forcing it to roll back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.The pandemic has only piled on urgency and pressure to renew efforts to downsize. Nissan is due to announce a new recovery plan next month.	-2.254081379

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said Wednesday it is now recalling 3.2 million vehicles worldwide to address a fuel pump issue that could result in engines stalling.The Japanese automaker first said in January it would recall 696,000 U.S. vehicles with a fuel pump that may stop operating and lead to stalling of the engine. Dealers will replace the fuel pumps with new ones.Toyota said the recall now covers 1.8 million U.S. Toyota and Lexus vehicles in total in the United States, including older vehicles from as far back as the 2013 model year -- and more than 1 million vehicles than it announced in January.Toyota began a probe into the fuel pump issue in June.The automaker told the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in January it was aware of 66 field reports and 2,571 warranty claims that relate to fuel pump failures in the vehicles initially recalled.Owners have complained of rough engine running, engine not starting and loss of power while driving at low speeds. Toyota said the reports occurred more commonly in areas of the southern U.S. with warmer climates.	-5.255417957
TOKYO, April 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is introducing a new series of engines that will boost vehicle fuel efficiency by at least 10 percent, as carmakers strive to improve performance against a backdrop of rising fuel costs and tighter emissions controls.Toyota will introduce 14 engine models in the new series over the next two years, starting off with 1.0 litre and 1.3 litre gasoline engines, it said in a statement on Thursday.The world’s biggest car maker by sales volume has for years focused on gasoline-electric hybrid powertrains as a way of improving fuel efficiency, but outside Japan conventional engines remain much more popular than hybrids.Rivals such as Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Honda Motor Co have focused more on small engines with added features such as turbochargers.“We have been prioritising hybrids but there are still customers seeking cars that are not hybrids,�� said Shouji Adachi, an engineer in Toyota’s powertrain planning department.“Meanwhile other car makers without hybrid technology are becoming more competitive in that area and we need to do something about that,�� Adachi said.The launch comes at a sensitive time for Toyota’s image after it announced this week its second-largest recall ever targeting more than 6 million vehicles globally.Hybrid vehicles, including the Prius, accounted for around 14 percent of Toyota’s global sales in 2013, with most of that coming from Japan.Toyota said the new engine range would draw on technology gained from gas-electric hybrids, but would also use a number of other innovations to improve performance.Gasoline-driven cars currently utilise at most around 35 percent of the fuel’s energy, with the rest lost mainly to heat and friction. To improve that, Toyota has used techniques such as making the engine combustion more rapid by controlling the amount and the speed of the air that goes into the combustion chamber.In its new 1.0 litre and 1.3 litre engines Toyota improved peak thermal efficiency to between 37 and 38 percent, it said.In future the group aims to boost peak thermal efficiency to 40 percent and more, Adachi said.

SEOUL/SYDNEY (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N may consider shipping more South Korean-made cars to Australia, a source said on Friday, as part of a global restructuring that will see its Chevrolet brand in Europe dropped and production in Australia potentially scrapped.GM, which has been mulling its future in Australia for months, has decided to pull out as early as 2016, Australian media reported on Friday.One option that would be looked at was to supply Australia using factories in South Korea affected by GM’s announcement on Thursday that it will drop the Chevrolet brand in Europe by the end of 2015.GM Korea shipped 187,000 Chevy cars to Europe last year but the brand has failed to gain significant share in the market.“GM Korea could consider exporting Korean-made cars such as the Cruze compact to Australia if it were to shut down a plant there,�� the source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters.GM Korea has not started discussions on the plan yet, the source added.GM Korea last year exported about 30,000 vehicles including Barina/Aveo subcompact and Captiva sport utility vehicles to Australia, where they are sold under the Holden badge.Such a move might face a backlash in Australia, where there are widespread concerns that any exit by GM Holden will be followed by Toyota Motor Co 7203.T, causing a collapse of the entire domestic industry.“When Holden pulls out of this country, it will be a domino effect,�� said opposition Senator John Madigan, whose state of Victoria is the one of the major centers for Australia’s auto industry.“Already car component manufacturers have lost critical mass with the decision of Ford to pull out of Australia. If another one pulls out, that’s the end, then we’re going to be hearing about Toyota - there are going to be tens of thousands of jobs lost.”A spokeswoman for Toyota Australia, which has previously said it expects to make to a decision on its manufacturing future in the country in 2014, declined to comment.Citing unnamed senior government sources, the Australian Broadcasting Corp said GM had been expected to make an announcement on its plans to quit Australia this week but had put it off until early next year.A GM spokesman in Detroit declined to comment on the reports, while Holden said its discussions with the government were ongoing. Australia’s Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane said no decision had been made.Holden, which traces its roots in Australia to a saddle maker in 1856, makes vehicles at its Elizabeth plant in South Australia and engines in Port Melbourne, Victoria, employing almost 4,000 people and producing around 95,000 vehicles a year.Australia’s auto industry has been under pressure for years as high costs, a strong local dollar, weak exports and tough international competition take a toll.In May, Ford Motor Co F.N announced it would shut its two Australian auto plants in October 2016, following the exit of Mitsubishi Motors 7211.T in 2008.The industry has been propped up by billions of dollars in government support, which has become less certain since Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s conservative coalition won power in September.“The message we are getting from Holden is they are in two minds and I would like them to clarify what their position is,�� Abbott told local radio on Friday. “There is not going to be any extra money over and above the generous support taxpayers have been giving for some time,�� he added.Adding to the pressure on the industry, Australia on Thursday signed a free trade deal with South Korea, cutting tariffs on imports of cars and car parts.“You’ve got to look at the relative size of the industry. Korea pumped out 4.5 million vehicles last year - we did 221,000 - so you can imagine the size of their supply chain,�� Richard Reilly, the chief executive of Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers said. “They are going to be getting better access to our market going forward.”Ian Park, an analyst at IHS Automotive, said he expected GM Korea to seek to export more cars to Australia after Chevy is withdrawn from Europe, boosted by the trade deal.GM Korea said in a statement that: “The phase-out of Chevrolet in Western and Eastern Europe will increase focus on driving profitability, managing costs and maximizing sales opportunities in Korea.”Even before the FTA, vehicles were Australia’s second-largest import from South Korea, worth more than A$2 billion last year.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also said the trade deal could offer opportunities in Australia for GM’s Korean-made cars.“It also serves to put a little pressure on the Koreans. The costs in Korea are rising. The labor environment is not the friendliest in the world,�� he told Reuters.	-1.845952789
PARIS (Reuters) - Five-time rally world champion Sebastien Ogier of France looked set to win the 2018 season opener after extending his lead on the third day of the Rallye Monte Carlo on Saturday.The M-Sport Ford driver opened a 33.5-second lead over Estonian Ott Tanak (Toyota) with Finn Jari-Matti Latvala (Toyota) in third place almost a minute off the pace after 13 of the 17 stages.“That means it’s all going to plan.

BANGALORE/TOKYO, April 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday its Corolla was the world’s top selling car of 2012, contradicting rival Ford which claimed top spot for its Focus model.Ford said on Tuesday it sold 1.02 million Focus compact cars last year, citing data from automotive consulting firm Polk.It did not detail Corolla sales in a press release on its website, but various media reports have cited the U.S. carmaker as saying Toyota sold 872,774 Corollas last year.Toyota’s Tokyo-based spokesman Ryo Sakai said the Japanese carmaker sold 1.16 million Corollas in 2012 and that “Toyota still sees the Corolla as the world’s most popular car��.“The sales figure includes Corolla Sedan, which is over 90 percent of the total volume, and the Corolla Altis, Corolla Axio, Corolla Wagon, Corolla Fielder and Corolla Rumion,�� he said.It does not include Corolla derivatives like the Auris, Auris Hybrid, Verso, E’z, Matrix, Scion xB and Rukus, which do not share the ‘Corolla�� name.Polk could not immediately be reached for comment.	10.19597458
NAIROBI (Reuters) - At Suzuki Motor Corp's 7269.T showroom in the Kenyan capital, hundreds of its Alto compact cars are waiting to be collected.Most of the customers are drivers for ride-hailing company Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], which struck a loans and discount deal with the Japanese carmaker and South Africa's Stanbic Bank SBKJ.J, at the beginning of the year. Africa should be a huge growth market for automakers. Transport links are weak and personal car ownership is low. There are 25 cars per 1000 Kenyans compared to 786 in the United States, according to the World Bank. But many in Africa cannot afford to buy a vehicle, particularly just for personal use.The Alto deal in Kenya, soon to be extended to Uganda and Tanzania, offers financing of up to 100 percent for top-rated Uber drivers and a price of 850,000 Kenyan shillings ($8,349.71), lower than the usual 950,000 shillings. The loans are repaid with the money the driver earns providing services.Patrick Amenya, the sales director at CMC Motors, the local Suzuki franchisee, said the deal had helped him sell “more vehicles than normally we would.�� Suzuki sold 523 Altos in Kenya this year.Auto companies are linking up with fast-growing ride-hailing or delivery services around the world, aiming to transform a threat to their business into a growth opportunity. They offer discounts or financing deals for drivers in the hope they will pick their cars or vans, which could also encourage their clients to buy them.General Motors Co GM.N has invested in U.S. ride services firm Lyft and Toyota is also backing Uber. Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T is also an investor in Uber and Southeast Asia's ride-sharing app Grab. Five blocks from CMC in Nairobi, at Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T showroom light trucks and bikes are waiting for buyers. Some of these are drivers for Sendy, a local online delivery company. Like Uber, its drivers own their vehicles.Companies are becoming less likely to buy their own fleet of trucks, preferring a delivery service instead, said Dennis Awori, the chairman of Toyota East Africa, a Sendy investor.Toyota provides Sendy with a pipeline of truck owners. At the moment there is no financing deal or discount but Awori and Malaika Judd, Sendy’s chief operating officer, said this was under consideration.Suzuki’s strategy has propelled it from the bottom of sales tables in Kenya, where it languished for decades with emerging brands from China, to the top five along with Toyota, Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Ford.Koichi Suzuki, Suzuki’s manager for the Middle East and Africa, hopes it will soon have the edge over the others. The company is planning to adopt the same strategy in other markets.The Altos, which are tough and fuel-efficient, at CMC are made in India but could one day be made in Africa, Suzuki said.Nairobi is often a springboard for the rest of Africa and Uber, operates in seven African nations and 13 cities, offering employment to more than 100,000 drivers.“When you have a success story in one country in Africa, we can help to develop to a pan-African scale,�� said Richard Bielle, head of Toyota’s business in Africa.Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, invested $50 million in a plant in Rwanda this year to assemble its Polo, Passat and Terramont models. It also set up a ride-hailing app called VW Mobility Solutions as no other service is available there yet. “Most of the people might not be able to afford a brand-new car so the question is how do we do satisfy that market?,�� said Michaella Rugwizangoga, CEO of VW Mobility Solutions.“Our business model is to use the locally assembled VW vehicles to deliver our solutions for two years and sell them as second hand cars to the market.”Kenya’s car market is dominated by second-hand imports, said Mariane Ochieng, Stanbic’s head of vehicle and asset finance.New vehicles are perceived as being out of reach of many buyers, mainly due to the higher taxes that they attract, she said.Like millions of other young Kenyans, 25-year old Joe Wanyoike was forced into self-employment after a futile search for work when he finished secondary school in 2011.He turned to a pre-owned vehicle imported from Japan which he hired at 50,000 shillings ($490.44) a month, and signed up on Uber to carry customers.The company shared Wanyoike’s data on number of trips, earnings and his rating of 4.7, near the maximum that is 5.0, with Stanbic Bank. This earned him a loan for a new Alto, allowing him to save money on fuel and more easily navigate Nairobi’s clogged streets.“I’m very happy because I could not afford a new car,�� he said.After the Alto’s success, CMC Motors has started discussions with Uber to increase the range of models available.“Everybody was a bit nervous about whether it could work but now we are all seeing the possibilities,�� said Amenya.	3.155919481
* Automakers post strongest Canada August auto sales ever* Ford sales rise 7.1 percent year over year* Chrysler up 6.6 percent, GM up 0.1 percentTORONTO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales recorded their best August ever, industry data released on Wednesday showed, with Ford Motor Co outselling Chrysler Group and General Motors Co, and Japan’s largest automakers making double-digit gains.Automakers sold 149,301 vehicles in Canada last month, a 6.5 percent rise compared with a year ago, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.Ford Canada sold the most cars in August, with sales rising 7.1 percent year over year. The Detroit automaker sold 27,268 cars and trucks in August, higher than the 25,461 it sold last August. Sales were up 1.8 percent so far this year.The automaker sold 40.4 percent more cars last month at 6,856 vehicles.

"NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - A Japanese banking lobby head warned of the dangers to the industry if the central bank topped up its already extreme monetary stimulus or deepened negative interest rates, amid signs authorities may have to do just that to support growth.The escalating U.S.-China trade war has jolted financial markets and triggered an unwelcome yen rise, adding pressure for the BOJ to ramp up massive stimulus to head off risks to the export-reliant economic recovery.With investors�� risk aversion pushing down U.S. Treasury yields and narrowing the interest-rate gap between the United States and Japan, a cut to the BOJ’s -0.1% short-term rate target is considered among the options to counter excessive yen gains.But Ichiro Fujiwara, who heads an association of Japan’s second-tier regional banks, said deepening negative rates would add to the cumulative pain on the banking sector from years of ultra-loose policy.""The side-effects of such a step would be bigger and affect not just regional banks but the entire financial industry,"" said Fujiwara, who is also president of Bank of Nagoya 8522.T - a regional bank based in the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi.“The BOJ may say it will look at the benefits and costs of such measures. But for us, there would be no merits at all,�� he told Reuters on Tuesday.Bank of Nagoya’s home market is among the most competitive areas for lenders operating in Japan.Home to auto giant Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and its parts suppliers, Aichi has plenty of profitable borrowers unlike other regions in Japan, which are struggling with shrinking populations and an exodus of companies to bigger cities.But that has intensified competition among banks flocking to the prefecture seeking higher returns. The average lending rate in Aichi was 1.1% in the fiscal year ended March 2018, the lowest among all prefectures, according to research firm Teikoku Data Bank.Bank of Nagoya is Aichi’s second largest lender but only commands a market share of just over 10%, with more than 20 other banks and small trust associations crowding the market.Fujiwara said he did not expect interest rates to rise much in coming years, as overseas economic uncertainty kept the BOJ from exiting ultra-loose policy.That means regional banks needed to quickly come up with new ways to compete, though merging or consolidating business with other banks isn’t necessarily the best option, Fujiwara said.“I have absolutely no plan to do so,�� Fujiwara said, when asked whether Bank of Nagoya could merge or consolidate operations with other banks.As with other regional banks, Bank of Nagoya needs to become less reliant on conventional lending and grow business through income streams like consultancy and advisory fees, he said.“Merging or consolidating won’t solve deeper problems.��"	2.987053502
TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to raise its stake in Subaru Corp to more than 20% from around 17% now, expanding their partnership to invest more effectively in new technologies, Nikkei reported on Friday.The move is seen costing more than 70 billion yen ($650 million) based on Subaru’s stock market value, the Japanese business daily said, without citing sources.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O outpaced analyst estimates for second-quarter vehicle deliveries on Thursday, defying a trend of plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as coronavirus-linked lockdown orders kept shoppers at home, and sending its shares up 8%.The unexpected delivery numbers come a day after Tesla became the highest-valued automaker, surpassing the market capitalization of former front-runner Toyota Motors Corp 7203.T.The rally on Thursday further widens Tesla’s lead over legacy automakers as investors grow confident in its ability to define the industry’s electric and software-driven future.Shares surged by about $85 in early trading to $1,204.Analysts said the solid delivery numbers heightened expectations for a profitable second quarter, which would mark the first time in Tesla’s history that it would report four consecutive quarters of profit.“A 90k delivery number in this COVID lockdown environment is a jaw dropper,�� Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.Tesla delivered 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, significantly above estimates for 74,130 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data. It delivered 80,050 units of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 for the quarter.The company did not break out deliveries by model or country, but Chinese vehicle registrations showed accelerating consumer demand for the Model 3 sedan. Nearly 16,200 Teslas were registered in China in April and May combined, with June figures still outstanding.The company is also ramping up output at its Shanghai vehicle factory, where it aims to produce 150,000 vehicles by the end of this year. The Shanghai plant was only briefly impacted by coronavirus shutdowns in late January and early February.Tesla’s only U.S. vehicle factory -- in California, where the bulk of its vehicles is currently produced -- was shut down for some six weeks during the quarter, heeding local orders to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. While vehicle deliveries increased 2.5% on a quarterly basis, production dropped nearly 20%.“While our main factory in Fremont was shut down for much of the quarter, we have successfully ramped production back to prior levels,�� the automaker said in a statement.Tesla in January said 2020 vehicle deliveries should comfortably exceed 500,000 units, a forecast the company has left unchanged despite the pandemic.Tesla is now seeking a location for a second U.S. vehicle factory to build its Model Y and a new electric pickup truck, zeroing in on Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Austin, Texas.Other major automakers posted lower U.S. monthly or quarterly new vehicle sales on Wednesday due in large part to weak fleet orders, but said consumer demand remained robust despite the continuing coronavirus pandemic.	-4.756654591
WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - An executive with the Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp was indicted on Thursday for conspiring to fix the prices of seat belts sold to carmakers, the U.S. Justice Department said.The indictment is the latest in a global probe of price fixing of auto parts. A total of 32 companies have pleaded guilty or agreed to do so and 50 executives have taken a plea bargain or been indicted in the investigation.Hiromu Usuda, a sales executive for Takata from 2005 to 2011, is accused of meeting with executives of other companies that make seat belts to reach agreements on what they would charge, the department said.The affected automakers were Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Nissan Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, which makes Subaru cars, the department said.Efforts to reach Usuda for comment through Takata were unsuccessful.The Justice Department and other antitrust enforcers worldwide have been investigating price fixing of more than 30 car parts, including air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components.

TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it would add a second shift at its Russian factory in September, hiring 600 new workers.The factory in St. Petersburg currently produces about 20,000 Camrys a year on a single shift. Its workforce will rise to about 1,750 when two-shift operations begin, Japan’s top automaker said in a statement.The factory has a production capacity of 50,000 vehicles a year.Toyota said it would also add stamping and resin-molding processes at the factory in 2014 to promote further localisation in Russia.	-3.436988543
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will offer at least 2 million yen ($19,700) in subsidies for fuel-cell vehicles, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said according to media, as the government and Japanese carmakers including Toyota Motor Corp join forces to speed up the introduction the vehicles.The subsidy would mean that consumers would pay about 5 million yen for Toyota’s fuel-cell sedan, which is set to go on sale by the end of March 2015 and priced at about 7 million yen.Abe, who visited a hydrogen station and test-drove fuel-cell cars on Friday, vowed to back the technology through subsidies and the purchase of the cars by government agencies.“This is the car of a new era because it doesn’t emit any carbon dioxide and it’s environmentally friendly,�� Abe told reporters. “The government needs to support this.”Abe’s growth strategy promotes the use of hydrogen energy and fuel-cell cars, which use hydrogen as fuel and run on electricity from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen and emit only water vapor and heat, though some carbon dioxide is emitted when hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons.Honda Motor Co is also set to start selling its fuel-cell vehicle in 2015.Both the government and many industry experts reckon the technology could take decades to become widely used partly because of the costs of building up infrastructure of hydrogen fuel stations.($1 = 101.3200 Japanese Yen)	-1.441092196
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Battery-powered electric vehicles don’t have a practical future as a long-range alternative to conventional cars even if technological breakthroughs allow them to be charged quickly, a top engineer at Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday.Electric vehicle (EV) supporters have touted developing high-speed charging technology as the way forward for cars like Nissan Motor Co’s Leaf. But Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of Toyota’s hydrogen fuel-cell car Mirai, said that would guzzle so much energy at once as to defeat the purpose of the EV as an ecologically sound form of transportation.“If you were to charge a car in 12 minutes for a range of 500 km (310 miles), for example, you’re probably using up electricity required to power 1,000 houses,�� Tanaka told a small group of reporters at the first test-drive event for the production version of the Mirai, the world’s only mass-market fuel-cell car.“That totally goes against the need to stabilize electricity use on the grid.”Even as rivals such as Nissan and Volkswagen AG promote battery EVs, cars like the Leaf require lengthy charging, reducing their attractiveness for customers planning to drive longer distances frequently. The Leaf requires about eight hours for a full charge using a 200-volt outlet, giving a listed driving range of around 84 miles in the United States.“Toyota isn’t denying the benefits of EVs,�� Tanaka said. “But we think the best way to use them is to charge them at night (to avoid peak power consumption hours), and use them for short distances during the day.”Instead, Toyota says hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) offer the most promising zero-emission alternative to conventional cars since they have a similar driving range and refueling time.While FCVs require massive investment and government subsidies for fuelling stations, Tanaka noted that hydrogen - the most abundant element in the universe - could be extracted from many different sources and had the advantage of being portable and more easily stored than electricity.He noted that the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka last month completed a fuelling station that uses hydrogen made from sewage and that could power about 70 Mirai FCVs a day.“Of course, there are technological hurdles that need to be cleared to make this commercially viable,�� he said.“But remember ‘Back to the Future��? In that movie, a car from 30 years in the future comes back to the present - the year 1985,�� he said, referring to the flying Hollywood time machine that was powered by garbage.“The Mirai doesn’t fly, but this year, 2015, is that future.��	0.7223867659
DETROIT, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Toyota’s luxury brand Lexus topped a vehicle dependability survey of owners of 3-year-old cars and trucks as model-year 2009 vehicles improved to record-high quality levels, J.D. Power &amp; Associates said on Wednesday.Chrysler vehicles, made during the tail end of ownership by a private equity firm before it was taken over by Fiat SpA in mid-2009, were at the bottom of the list for dependability and reliability, J.D. Power’s survey showed.Model-year cars from 2009, made during one of the worst downturns in automotive history, were more reliable than those in any previous survey, which dates back to 1990, said David Sargent, vice president of global automotive for J.D. Power &amp; Associates.“The data is pretty clear,�� Sargent said. “These were the best quality vehicles ever built up until this time. It’s a pretty good testament to the industry. Some of the automakers were facing, potentially, the end, and all of them were struggling to sell any product.”In 2009, U.S. auto sales hit the lowest level since World War Two, when adjusted for population, and both Chrysler and General Motors Co underwent government-sponsored bankruptcies and Ford Motor Co borrowed heavily to avoid the same fate.Behind Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus in order of consumer perception were Porsche ; GM’s luxury brand Cadillac; Toyota’s namesake brand, Toyota’s youth-oriented Scion brand; Daimler AG’s luxury Mercedes-Benz brand; Ford’s luxury brand Lincoln and then Ford’s namesake line.Among non-luxury brands, the leaders were, in order: Toyota, Ford, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda Motor Co.At the bottom were Chrysler’s namesake brand, and three other Chrysler brands -- Dodge, Jeep and Ram trucks.Sargent said cars and trucks made since 2010 for all four of those Chrysler brands have improved dramatically.	1.900777047
* April-June oper profit up 7.1 pct, beats forecasts* FY oper profit outlook raised to 770 bln yen from 760 bln* Honda’s N.American Q1 operating profit down 6 pct* Production at new Mexico plant slower than expected -exec* Still aims for annual US sales target of 1.55 mln vehicles (Adds executive comment, North American profit decline, Brazil and China information)By Yoko KubotaTOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said teething troubles at a new plant in Mexico dented sales and profit in the U.S. market, its biggest, taking the shine off a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit powered by brisk results in Japan.U.S. sales by Japan’s third-largest automaker dipped 0.8 percent in the first half, while sales rose at rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co. It posted a 6.0 percent drop in North American operating profit for the April-June quarter.Overall earnings were buoyant, however, with a 7.1 percent rise in quarterly operating profit to 198.04 billion yen ($1.9 billion), beating the 181.8 billion yen mean estimate of 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Honda said its Mexico plant, which makes the Fit subcompact, was hit by delays as it adopted new manufacturing techniques, but the company kept its full-year U.S. sales targets unchanged and said volumes would get back on track.“We are extra careful with quality, and that’s why initial delivery was somewhat delayed, but as the workers acquire more skills, we can catch up,�� Honda Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura, who heads the company’s U.S. operations, told a news conference on Tuesday.“We want to hit our annual (U.S. sales) target of 1.55 million vehicles, and we are doing our best to do so.”Honda nudged up its full-year profit forecast to 770 billion yen from 760 billion to reflect a slightly weaker yen projection.The company also cited the delayed launch of the new Acura TLX sedan as another factor behind its dull performance in the United States for the quarter.Honda’s average U.S. incentive per vehicle in April-June was $1,941, according to TrueCar - up 11 percent from a year ago and slightly higher than Toyota’s, although below Nissan’s. A Honda spokesman said it was trying to keep incentive levels low for key models such as the Accord and the Civic.The quarterly operating margin for Honda’s four-wheeled vehicle business was an anaemic 4.3 percent, nearly flat from a year ago, weighed down by the cost of investments in new plants in Mexico, Thailand and Brazil.Honda is carefully watching conditions in Brazil, where auto sales are slumping despite government stimulus, to decide whether it needs to push back the start of a new $430 million plant, Iwamura said.Weakness in the United States was outweighed by strength in Japan due partly to strong sales of the redesigned Fit and to back-orders left over from a rush of buying that preceded an April 1 sales tax hike.In China, Honda’s sales grew 11.7 percent year-on-year in January-June, but the car maker’s inventories have built up somewhat, and it has curtailed operations at its Wuhan plant to one shift per day from two, Iwamura said.Honda’s shares ended down 0.8 percent before the earnings were announced, compared with a 0.6 percent rise in Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei average. The shares were down 18 percent for the year so far, underperforming the Nikkei’s 4 percent drop.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average bounded up on Monday morning after better-than-expected U.S. jobs data eased fears of a slowdown in the U.S. economy, while strong earnings for Toyota Motor Co 7203.T reassured investors amid a poor earnings season.Other automakers such as Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7201.T also fared well from a softer yen, with demand for the safe-haven currency falling on Friday amid a risk rally as data showed U.S. employers hired the most workers in five months in July.The Nikkei .N225 rose 1.7 percent to 8,702.34, stopping short of strong resistance around 8,741, its 25-day moving average.“Risk aversion is lifting but the gains we’re seeing are mostly driven by short-covering and exporters are still largely in a bad way, as the earnings showed,�� said Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online Securities.Sharp Corp's 6753.T woes continued as it shed 4.2 percent, extending Friday's 28 percent dive after the company shocked investors by revising its full-year outlook to a massive operating loss.Taiwanese company Hon Hai Precision Industry 2317.TW also said on Friday that Sharp had agreed Hon Hai did not need to honor a March agreement to invest in Sharp ""due to the volatility of the share price"".However, investors returned to buy some companies that were punished for poor earnings or guidance, propping up the market.Komatsu Ltd 6301.T gained 1.5 percent after slumping 8.1 percent last week to hit a 9-1/2 month low following a cut of 17 percent in the construction machine maker's full-year operating profit forecast.Likewise Honda, which fell 5.7 percent on Wednesday after investors were disappointed with its U.S. quarterly sales, recovered 2.7 percent, helped by the softer yen.Toyota rose 2.5 percent after posting its largest quarterly operating profit for four years in April-to-June, while the company hiked its full-year sales target on strong U.S. and domestic demand.JPMorgan reiterated its “overweight�� rating for the stock and said in a note: “We believe there is considerable medium-term scope for margin gains, driven by North America, starting from a low base, and by brisk business in emerging economies.”Gains for economically sensitive sectors were evidence of stronger risk appetite, which was blunted last week after a lack of immediate action from the European Central Bank and a host of poor earnings from several blue-chips.The Topix's mining subsector .IMING.T and securities subsector .ISECU.T put on 4.6 and 2.8 percent respectively, but investors were still wary.“The uncertainty and negative factors that hurt stocks last week are still lurking, so I think that gains will be limited,�� said Hideyuki Fukunaga, CEO at Investrust.Market players are now eyeing a raft of important Chinese data and the conclusion of a Bank of Japan policy meeting, both due on Thursday.“If the Chinese data comes out positive then we might see a reversal of the losses suffered last week after all the central banks disappointed by not introducing further easing,�� Fukunaga said.The broader Topix .TOPX rose 1.4 percent to 733.93, turning positive on the year again after slipping to 0.6 percent down on the year on Friday. Trade was moderate on the main board, with volume at 42.6 percent of its 90-day full-day average.The Nikkei is now 2.9 percent up on 2011, while the Topix is just 0.7 percent up on the year, as investor confidence has been rocked by the euro-zone crisis and concern about slowing growth in the U.S. and China."	-2.860681115
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Credit Corp [TOYOM.UL] has agreed to pay up to $21.9 million in restitution to thousands of African-American, Asian and Pacific Islander customers, for charging them higher interest rates on auto loans than white borrowers with comparable creditworthiness, the U.S. government said.Toyota Motor Credit will also change its pricing and compensation system to substantially reduce dealer discretion and financial incentives to mark up interest rates, the U.S. Justice Department and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in a statement on Tuesday.The U.S. financing arm for the world’s largest automaker said in a statement it decided to reach a voluntary agreement with the United States so it could “preserve consumer financing options while fairly compensating its dealer partners and upholding its commitment to fair lending practices.”It added it “respectfully disagrees with the agencies�� methodologies to determine whether industry lending practices have been discriminatory.”The agreement limits the amount dealers can mark up a loan to a maximum of 125 basis points, according to its statement.Ally Financial agreed to establish an $80 million restitution fund when it settled allegations of discrimination in auto financing last year. Similarly, last year the finance arm for Honda Motor Co. agreed to pay $24 million and Fifth Third Bancorp to pay $18 million over discrimination.“The CFPB’s campaign to eliminate auto loan discounts has already cost consumers money and eroded the rights that every consumer has to negotiate and benefit from a competitive marketplace,�� said a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association, in reaction to the announcement.The CEO of AutoNation, Inc. the largest U.S. auto dealership chain, has urged other dealers to follow the practices outlined in the Honda settlement, saying they could reduce variability in loans without hurting the dealer economically.In its complaint against Toyota’s financing arm, the United States said that from 2011 through 2013 the average black customer was obliged to pay more than $200 and the average Asian or Pacific Islander customer more than ��$100 more during the term of the loan because of discrimination.”Before Sept. 10, 2014, Toyota did not require dealers to document reasons for adding basis points to loans and did not monitor its portfolio for possible discrimination, the complaint added.	-4.730846161
DANYANG China (Reuters) - Amid a revival in sales of Japanese goods in China and talk of renewed investment from some big firms such as Toyota, a dusty industrial park near Nanjing offers a cold reality check on the health of ties between Asia’s two biggest economies.Despite offering rent-free premises for the first three years to companies expanding to China, the Japan Automotive Parts Industrial Center (JAPIC), set up in Danyang, 200 km (120 miles) west of Shanghai, in 2011, remains near empty.A visit to the Danyang park, the brainchild of former Toyota Motor Corp executive Kazuo Azuma, challenges the view that Japan Inc’s engagement with China is slowly recovering from the shock of anti-Japanese protests that erupted two years ago.“Do we see any ray of hope?�� asks Azuma, who has spent more than 20 years in China, mostly building factories for Toyota. “To be honest, none at the moment. Japan’s full of risk-birds chirping, ‘China risk��.”Azuma’s vision was to transplant up to 400 auto parts makers from Japan’s industrial heartland, to help them survive the global shift in car demand to emerging economies. China, which is expected to generate annual sales of well above 30 million vehicles by 2020, appears the obvious choice for such firms to establish a base.But JAPIC has only 24 parts producers in operation �� half of what had been envisioned by now.Azuma and the Danyang local government, which has invested at least 220 million yuan ($36 million) in the project, have called off the second and third phases of construction.They have also decided to drop “Japan�� from the park’s name and to try to woo Taiwanese and other suppliers with ties with Japanese producers.Tensions between Tokyo and Beijing spiked in September 2012 after Japan nationalized a small chain of disputed islets in the East China Sea, triggering sometimes violent demonstrations and a boycott of Japanese goods by some Chinese consumers.Firms such as Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan Motor Co Ltd saw sales slump.Japan’s direct investments to China fell nearly 20 percent in 2013 and dropped another 40 percent to 300.8 billion yen ($2.8 billion) during the first half of 2014 compared with a year earlier.Southeast Asia became a primary destination for Japanese investment, attracting almost three times the amount going to China. During the first half of this year Southeast Asia attracted 878.1 billion yen worth of investments.Jing Donggen, a senior Danyang government official in charge of the economic development zone where JAPIC is located, thinks the downturn in Japanese interest is temporary.“We’re confident in this program because there is limited growth opportunity for Japan’s small- and medium-sized companies in their homeland,�� he said.There is some recent evidence from bigger Japanese companies to support that hope, with the major car makers, for example, seeing some pick-up in sales and making bullish forecasts.Honda is aiming to boost volumes by 19 percent to 900,000 vehicles this year. Toyota, which is also trying to boost sales by about 20 percent to 1.1 million vehicles in 2014, is considering adding manufacturing capacity again, possibly building a new assembly plant by as early as 2018.Yet smaller companies remain wary.Kyowa Metal Works Co., a manual transmission supplier in Yokohama, passed up an opportunity to expand its operations in Wuhan in 2012, opting instead for a 2 billion yen move to open a plant near Jakarta.“If there are political conflicts in China, who knows. We might not be able to repatriate what we have invested,�� said Chief Executive Masumi Takashima.In the short-term, it may not matter much to China that Japanese firms, which have long been the top direct investors in China excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan, are now holding back.Investors from other economies, including Singapore and South Korea, are eagerly taking up the slack. After two decades of development, China’s auto industry is also less reliant on foreign expertise and know-how.But in the longer run, the slowing Japanese investment could deal a blow to the development of Chinese technology, especially if China looks to expand in more cutting-edge areas, such as hydrogen fuel propulsion.To be sure, most Japanese companies aren’t about to give up on China completely. Many of those who have set up operations at JAPIC remain positive.Konan Kogyo K.K., a small electrostatic painting company based near Toyota City, began operating a metal painting line in Danyang with 50 workers in early 2012 and is contemplating opening another line to double capacity.“It would be a lie if I said we are not concerned about the political tension between Japan and China,�� says Konan’s Danyang-based manager Hiromitsu Ozaki. “But I think we made the right decision to open shop here.”But other evidence from the ground is bleak. In Beijing and Shanghai, there is an exodus of Japanese expatriates and their families, though air pollution and a general economic slowdown are also blamed, along with the political tensions.The number of Japanese nationals living in Shanghai and neighboring Jiangsu fell 18 percent to 60,300 over the year through October 2013, the first decline since the Japanese consulate in Shanghai began conducting the survey in 1994.The Japanese school of Beijing’s student population has fallen to 480, from more than 600 last year.Azuma bemoans that Japanese firms no longer appear capable of looking at China objectively.“If there are 100 news items about China and 10 are bad, all 10 items would make the evening news, but the rest is ignored because anything negative on China sells in Japan,�� he said.(1 US dollar = 6.1301 Chinese yuan)(1 US dollar = 106.8700 Japanese yen)	-3.832365995
(Reuters) - The governor of central Japan’s Aichi, which includes the city of Nagoya and also hosts Toyota Motor Corp, on Thursday said he would declare a state of emergency for his prefecture the following day.Hideaki Omura made the announcement two days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe formally imposed a state of emergency on Tokyo and six other parts of the country.Aichi was not included in the emergency despite having the fifth-highest number of infections among Japan’s prefectures, data from public broadcaster NHK shows.Omura told a news conference that his prefecture had been in talks with the central government and was making preparations towards being included.The central government will respond “swiftly,�� he said.	0.1701644923
(Repeats July 13 story with no changes)DETROIT, July 13 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd on Friday will unveil its newest-generation Accord, one of four re-engineered midsize sedans that Asian automakers are betting on to win market share as Detroit automakers shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp’s all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda’s U.S. dealers.Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday’s event in Detroit.The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers�� U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co &lt;005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily.“There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment,�� said Jack Hollis, Toyota’s head of marketing for North America.Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said.“They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched,�� said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc, the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group.“NOT FINDING A PLACE WITH CONSUMERS”The Accord for years was Honda’s top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former.Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J)The new Accord and Camry “may stem the decline,�� said IHS Markit’s Tom Libby. “I don’t think they will cause a marked reverse.”Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said.“As a dealer we can’t ask for much more.��	2.447203843
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor's chief executive 7201.T said on Saturday he planned to launch a number of new vehicles in the growing Chinese market over the next five years, including electrical cars, that could help the struggling Japanese automaker return to profit.“The recovery in the Chinese market has been very remarkable, and our key segments have returned to the previous year’s level if not slightly better,�� CEO Makoto Uchida said at a press conference at the Beijing auto show via a video link from Japan. “I expect this rebound to continue, but we need to watch for signs of trouble,�� he added.Uchida and the company’s China boss, Shohei Yamazaki, said Nissan will launch nine new and re-designed electric models in the world’s biggest auto market by 2025, including plug-in electric vehicles and hybrid electric cars that charge with a gasoline engine.Uchida’s remarks come as investors express concern about Japan’s second-largest carmaker, which has warned of a record $4.5 billion loss this year as the pandemic hampers its turnaround.Growth in China is a key part of Nissan’s effort to recover from rapid expansion that left it with dismal margins and an ageing portfolio that the automaker says is a result of a mismanagement by former boss Carlos Ghosn, who was arrested for financial misdeeds which he denies.Nissan has pledged to cut 300 billion yen ($2.84 billion)from annual fixed costs and focus on each of the company’s three biggest markets: China, the United States and Japan.Yet, while China’s automotive market continues to recover strongly, Nissan last month saw its business shrink 2.4% after showing modest growth every month since April.That sales contraction was in stark contrast to Japanese rivals Toyota and Honda, which have both seen rapid sales growth since the pandemic’s effects began easing in China over the summer.In August, Toyota vehicles sales in China rose 27.2% from last year, while Honda’s grew 19.7%.To bolster its finances, Nissan this month said it plans to issue $8 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and is considering euro-denominated debt. The bond sale is its first dollar-denominated issuance since its tie-up with France's Renault SA RENA.PA in 1999, a Nissan representative said.A Nissan spokeswoman said some of that money would be used to repay other debt.“Although Nissan continues to have sufficient levels of liquidity, we are seeking to strengthen our liquidity position in order to ensure smooth implementation of our business transformation plan,�� she said.	-2.323358577

EditorsNote: updates with Kahne’s truck failed inspectionKahne wins again, but truck fails inspectionBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed for The Sports XchangeCONCORD, N.C. -- Driving for Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s JR Motorsports, in the organization’s second start in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, pole-sitter Kasey Kahne won a two-lap drag race against Erik Jones for his fifth victory in six starts in the series.Kahne’s victory in the North Carolina Education Lottery 200 at Charlotte Motor Speedway denied the dominant No. 4 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota of Jones, who led 88 laps but ran a disappointing second after a late caution forced a green-white-checkered flag finish that took the race five laps past its scheduled distance of 134 laps.In his six Truck Series starts, Kahne has five wins and a second-place finish.Kahne’s No. 00 Chevrolet, however, failed post-race inspection. NASCAR deemed the front of the truck too low on both sides and too high in the right rear. The sanctioning body will take the truck to its nearby research-and-development center for further evaluation.If penalties are forthcoming, they will be announced next week.Kahne’s margin of victory was a mere .005 of a second, tied for second closest in series history behind the .002-second margin of Kyle Busch over Aric Almirola at Talladega in October 2010.“Jones was really fast,�� Kahne said. “He was kind of in a league of his own when he could get to clean air. I knew if we could stay back and stay with him (on the final restart), as long as he didn’t get to clean air, it would be all right.“I was able to side-draft, and it worked out perfect to get back to the line.”Less than half a lap before Jones would have taken the white flag-after Jones made a deft pass for the lead to the outside on Lap 131 -- Daniel Hemric’s accident in Turn 1 caused the fifth caution of the night, sending the race to overtime.Jones picked the outside lane for the final restart on Lap 138, but couldn’t clear Kahne, who side-drafted Jones�� Toyota Tundra off the final corner and beat him to the stripe.In the wake of last week’s misfortune at Kansas Speedway, where Jones led 151 of 167 laps but ran short of fuel while leading late in the race, Friday night’s result left the young driver bitterly disappointed.“It’s really a shame that we can’t bring it home,�� Jones said. “I really thought tonight was the night. Unfortunately, we just couldn’t do it.“It just sucks. I don’t know what to say. It just really, really hurts. I can’t believe it, man. I really wanted this one, and it’s hard to come home second.”Interestingly, though Kahne and Jones qualified on the front row, both drivers had to start the race from the rear of the field, Kahne for an unapproved adjustment (changing a broken shock) and Jones for arriving late to the drivers1 meeting.But by Lap 26, after the first caution, Jones had the lead, a position he maintained until the late caution gave Kahne the opportunity he needed.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race - NC Education Lottery 200Charlotte Motor SpeedwayConcord, North CarolinaFriday, May 15, 20151.

TOKYO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co, said he was unfazed by delays in his electric vehicle sales targets, predicting rivals would face even greater obstacles in their plans to launch fuel cell car sales over the next few years.Ghosn on Wednesday reiterated that Renault and Nissan would push back by two to three years an intitial target to sell a combined 1.5 million electric vehicles by end-March 2017.While Nissan has moved back its EV target, it also said it would lift U.S. production of its all-electric Leaf, the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, after a price cut boosted sales in that market.“Do I regret my investment on electric cars? No, obviously,�� Ghosn told reporters at the Tokyo Motor Show.Nissan and Renault combined have so far sold only 120,000 electric vehicles since they first brought one to market three years ago.But the difficulties with recharging infrastructure, which Ghosn blamed as the key reason hobbling electric vehicles�� popularity rather than any technical problems, foretell an even more daunting challenge for fuel cell vehicles, he said.Both Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co plan to start selling fuel cell vehicles around 2015.“Frankly, I don’t know how they are going to do it, because knowing all the problems we have, to have a charging system with electricity, where is the hydrogen infrastructure?�� Ghosn said.“That’s why we have postponed, in a certain way, some of our ambitions in terms of fuel cells.”Fuel-cell cars chemically convert hydrogen to electricity to power the vehicle, emitting only water vapour as a waste product. Unlike electric vehicles which can be recharged from home as well as charging stations, fuel-cell cars must stop at refilling stations.Battery-powered electric cars, however, also have a relatively limited range - the Leaf goes at most 230 km (143 miles) on a single charge - and can take hours to recharge. Fuel-cell cars can refuel within minutes and travel more than double that distance, roughly on par with conventional gasoline-powered cars.But the high cost of hydrogen stations, at $6 million apiece, poses a major hurdle for fuel cell vehicles.Toyota unveiled a fuel cell concept sedan at the Tokyo Motor Show on Wednesday with two hydrogen tanks and a driving range of 500 km.The car will sell for 5 million to 10 million yen ($50,000-100,000) when it goes on sale in 2015, said Satoshi Ogiso, a Toyota managing officer who was involved in developing the Prius hybrid.Honda is also showing a fuel cell concept car at the Los Angeles auto show this week.Nissan is not rejecting fuel cell technology - it plans to bring one to market in 2017. But that lags Toyota and Honda by two years.Major carmakers around the world are spending billions of dollars to develop fuel-cell technology, and to limit the burden some have formed alliances.Toyota and BMW AG plan on rolling out a jointly developed fuel cell vehicle system by 2020. Honda and General Motors Co are also jointly developing a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle systems over the next seven years, while Nissan, Daimler and Ford plan to develop and launch affordable fuel-cell vehicles within five years.	-5.04736884
* May cease models, cut procurement costs* VW brand trails 6 pct profit margin goal* Analyst sees risk of brand margins slipping further* VW declines comment on rumours of CEO contract extension* Management must cut out its own mistakes -VW labour chief (Adds comment from VW works council chief)By Jan Schwartz and Andreas CremerHAMBURG/BERLIN, Germany, July 15 (Reuters) - Volkswagen plans to cut costs at its core passenger-car brand by about 5 billion euros ($6.8 billion) per year from 2017 as it struggles to match the earnings power of global rival Toyota.VW’s namesake brand, the carmaker’s biggest division by sales and deliveries, is lagging a profit margin target of at least 6 percent because of fixed costs that it said are high relative to Japan’s Toyota.The brand’s 2013 profit margin was 2.9 percent, compared with auto division margins of 8.8 percent at Toyota and 9 percent at Hyundai Motor Co of Korea. Much of VW’s production is in its home market of Germany, where workers secured a significant pay increase last year.Analysts have said VW’s profitability gains are disappointing given its steady expansion. The company looks set to hit a sales goal of 10 million autos a year in 2014, four years ahead of target.“Let’s be honest: We have a lot of catching up to do with our core competitors,�� Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn wrote in a letter to VW managers obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.“That is why we must now take action that is clear, effective and sometimes painful,�� the CEO said, pointing out that research and development costs had surged 80 percent across the multi-brand group since 2010.To boost efficiency across its 310-model empire, Europe’s biggest automotive group is reviewing its strategy. A post-2018 plan dubbed “future tracks�� will set out priorities on technology and model policy and may be outlined later this year.“VW’s and Audi’s product momentum remains tough for 2015,�� said Arndt Ellinghorst, London-based analyst at investment researchers ISI Group. “We see a real chance that margins keep slipping.”Winterkorn said VW may decide to cease making non-profitable models, citing convertible cars at the namesake brand which accounted for over a third of the group’s 47.8 billion euros in first-quarter revenue but only about 15 percent of operating profit.Other steps may include reducing procurement costs and improving sales channels, according to VW.VW shares ended 0.03 percent lower on Tuesday.The CEO’s call for greater cost discipline follows a similar plea in February, when Winterkorn urged senior managers to keep costs down to weather tough market conditions.VW toned down its 2014 profit guidance in February, saying core earnings may only improve if economic conditions improve more than expected, especially in Europe where VW sells about 40 percent of its vehicles.Staff representatives urged VW’s management to pay heed to workers amid the efficiency drive.“Management must cut out its own mistakes,�� Bernd Osterloh, head of VW’s works council wrote in a newsletter to be published on Thursday. “The focus needs to be shifted to whatever earns money,�� Osterloh, who sits on VW’s supervisory board, said.Separately, VW declined comment on a report by Germany’s Manager Magazin published on Tuesday saying that Winterkorn had agreed with leaders of the supervisory board to extend his contract by two years until 2018.	-1.896768779
SHANGHAI, April 19 (Reuters) - Foreign automakers continue to plough money into factories in China, the world’s largest car market, even as the biggest economic slowdown in a quarter of a century crimps sales growth.Market leaders Volkswagen AG and General Motors show no sign of letting up on their planned investments, while Toyota Motor and Ford Motor are also pursuing new China expansion plans.That’s in spite of the economic slowdown further depressing the car market in January-March, when sales grew only 3.9 percent, compared to 9.2 percent a year ago and way below the 7 percent growth that the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) predicts for this year.Foreign automakers, many of which are expected to unveil new products for China at this week’s Shanghai autoshow, including Ford’s redesigned Taurus sedan, aren’t fretting over the first quarter slowdown. But if the fallout from the broader economic slowdown bleeds into the rest of the year, global automakers may need to reconsider their China expansion plans, said James Chao, Asia chief of IHS Automotive.A handful of foreign automakers are still outperforming the market, with Ford, for example, posting 9 percent sales growth in the first quarter.“It’s still a tale of two worlds, with domestic manufacturers probably hovering around 60 percent capacity and the international joint ventures at 80-85 percent. It’s a big difference,�� Chao said.Anthony Lau, Shanghai-based research director for consultancy TNS Sinotrust, said even strong single-digit growth in car sales in China is much better than in markets elsewhere.China accounted for more than half the total industry spending on new or expanded capacity last year, with plant investments worth $12.7 billion, according to an annual Canadian study of automakers�� outlays.Foreign automakers are likely to hoover up more idle capacity from smaller domestic firms, said Chao at IHS, as Ford did in acquiring a factory from Harbin Hafei Automobile that will add 200,000 vehicle per year capacity when upgrades are finished in 2016.That follows Ford’s launch last month of a new factory in eastern China’s Hangzhou, with annual capacity for 250,000 vehicles. ID:nS8N0T100V]Even Toyota, whose first-quarter sales slipped 0.1 percent, is ending a years-long expansion freeze, spending $440 million to add a new facility and a third line at a factory in Guangzhou, which could start production in 2017 with capacity to make about 100,000 cars a year.Volkswagen is targeting China capacity of 5 million vehicles a year by 2019, up from 3.5 million in 2014, as part of a 22 billion euro ($23.3 billion) investment push, a company spokeswoman said, and GM has its sights on hitting that 5 million number a year earlier.By the time these expansions come on-line, the years of breakneck double-digit growth will likely be long gone: economists predict 7 percent GDP growth this year and a further notching down to 6.8 percent in 2016.	0.5766596987

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - New York State’s attorney general and those of 12 other states told the Trump administration in a letter Friday they would mount a vigorous court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules.In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda 7267.T and Nissan 7201.T reported on Tuesday their strongest monthly vehicles sales growth for China this year in September, thanks to a tax cut on small engine vehicles and comparatively weak growth for the same month last year.Competitor Ford F.N posted its strongest growth since January, while Toyota 7203.T sales increased the fastest since March.The Chinese auto market, the world’s largest, has rebounded strongly since October last year when the central government cut sales tax on vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters or smaller in response to slower sales in the weakening economy.That tax cut will continue to drive strong growth as consumers rush to buy cars before its planned expiry at the end of the year, according to analysts and industry officials.“This will be a pretty big stimulus for Q4,�� said Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) will report sales growth for the market overall on Wednesday, with Zhang predicting top-line growth of 25-30 percent.Honda posted the quickest growth among automakers reporting Tuesday, with a 46.5 percent year-on-year increase for the month.“The primary reason is new models plus added on top of that SUVs are very popular,�� said Zhu Linjie, a Beijing-based spokesman for Honda.Sales of its recently launched Civic sedan and Elysion multi-purpose vehicle more than quadrupled, with sales of XR-V and Vezel sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) growing at double-digit rates.Ford similarly reported strong SUV sales, as wealthier Chinese, often restricted by the government to buying one vehicle in many major cities, continue to upgrade to larger cars.China’s auto sales have outstripped expectations this year, with CAAM reporting last month that sales grew 11.4 percent for January to August, compared to its projection in January of 6 percent annual growth for 2016.	-2.778983934
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it would recall 6.5 million vehicles globally to fix a defect in the power window switch in models including the Yaris/Vitz subcompact, Corolla, Camry and others.Of the total, about 2.7 million are in North America, 1.2 million in Europe, and 600,000 in Japan, the automaker said. It said it was not aware of any crashes caused by the glitch.Toyota said modules in the power window master switch may have been lubricated inconsistently during the manufacturing process. Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short circuit. That in turn could cause the switch assembly to overheat and melt, and potentially lead to a fire, it said.Among other models subject to the recall are the Matrix, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia and Scion xB. The vehicles were produced between January 2005 and December 2010, Toyota said.Toyota also issued a separate recall in Japan of about 140,000 Crown and Crown Majesta models for a glitch that could cause the hood to open inadvertently.	-0.02425222312
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese buyers have bought between 150,000 and 180,000 tonnes of U.S. sorghum carried by three vessels previously bound for China amid a trade spat between Beijing and Washington, five industry sources with knowledge of the deals told Reuters.The cargoes were among roughly two dozen bought by China but left stranded after Beijing announced last month it would hit U.S. imports with a 178.6 percent deposit on the value of sorghum shipments, amid escalating trade tensions.Trading firms have been scrambling to offload the cargoes to other countries, including Spain, which has so far purchased five cargoes, and Saudi Arabia.Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp 8058.T bought one vessel carrying about 58,000 tonnes of U.S. sorghum, said a source who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. Mitsui &amp; Co 8031.T purchased some of the sorghum from that vessel, the source said.“The cargo has arrived at Kashima port and also stopped at Mizushima and Shibushi ports to offload some of the supply, with unloading work to be completed this week,�� the source said.Another source said the vessel arrived at Kashima late last month.Other buyers include Zen-Noh, a Japanese farmers' cooperative, and a pair of trading companies - Toyota Tsusho Corp 8015.T and Itochu Corp 8001.T, four sources said.""There may be another vessel coming to Japan if Marubeni Corp 8002.T succeeds in striking a deal with a partner of another country,"" one of the sources added.

Sorghum’s blending ratio slid to 2.3 percent in the 2016/17 financial year from 7.7 percent in 2012/13, said Commodity Intelligence, a Japanese commodity market research company.In 2017/18, Japan imported about 365,830 tonnes of grain sorghum, down from 1.46 million tonnes in 2012/13, according to government data.Japan’s increased sorghum purchases may mean reduced imports of other commonly used feed grains like corn, barley and wheat or less use of locally-grown feed rice, a source said.In the longer term, a lack of Chinese buyers could put pressure on sorghum prices, increasing its share of the Japanese feed market.“Many believe that this is a one-off thing, but if the U.S. producers sell sorghum at cheaper prices than corn, Japanese feedmakers may buy more sorghum and buy less corn or wheat,�� the source said."	0.3528374008
BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s commerce minister told representatives of foreign firms on Monday that the United States�� unilateralism and protectionism will impact both U.S. and China’s interests and hurt the global economy.China Commerce Minister Zhongshan told six multinational companies there was no winner in a trade war and that cooperation was the only correct choice, according to a statement posted on the commerce ministry’s website on Tuesday.China will accelerate its opening up and create a better business environment for companies, Zhong was quoted as saying.Representatives of foreign firms that met with the commerce minister, which included Samsung Electronics Co 005930.KS, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, HSBC Holdings HSBA.L and the Cohen Group, said they will continue to expand investment and cooperation in China, the commerce ministry said.	-6.686395265
* Island row fallout still weighs on sales* Hopes for early 2013 recovery too optimistic - analyst* Nissan China Oct sales fall 41 pct* South Korea’s Hyundai sales up 37 pct in Oct vs yr earlier (Adds analyst comments)By Fang Yan and Kazunori TakadaBEIJING/SHANGHAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd’s China car sales plunged 54 percent in October from a year earlier, with the pace of decline accelerating from the previous month as Japanese automakers suffer the backlash from a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.Smaller rival Nissan Motor Co. Ltd also reported a steepening slump in its China sales.The hit taken by Japanese firms in the world’s biggest auto market has been a boon for some Asian and European rivals, with Hyundai reporting it sold more cars in China in October than Honda and Toyota Motor Corp could muster between them.Honda, which earlier this week cut its full-year earnings forecast by a fifth, has warned it could be February before business returns to normal in its second-largest market, where consumers are turning to German, Korean and U.S. cars instead.But such a forecast may be too optimistic.“I think that’s Honda’s wishful thinking given the current circumstances,�� said John Zeng, Asia Pacific director of industry consultancy LMC Automotive. “A diplomatic row is not something within its control. As long as the stand-off continues, I don’t think we will see any substantial recovery.”Violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September after Japan nationalized two disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and the Senkaku in Japanese, by purchasing them from their private owners.The street protests have since eased but diplomatic tensions continue to fester, with both Japan and China sending patrol ships to waters near the uninhabited islands in recent weeks.The Chinese government has condemned violence against Japanese nationals and their property, but anti-Japanese coverage of the diplomatic row carried daily by state media is hurting the image of Japanese companies, industry observers say.Indeed, Honda’s sales decline in October accelerated from September when they fell 41 percent from the year-ago level.Honda, which builds cars in partnership with Dongfeng Motor Group Co and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co , sold 24,115 cars in China in October, down from 51,826 a year earlier.Sales in the first 10 months climbed 2.7 percent to 494,108, the company said in a brief statement.Nissan, which makes vehicles in China in partnership with Dongfeng Automobile Group Co, sold 64,300 vehicles in China in October, down 41 percent from a year earlier. That was worse than a 35 percent year-on-year fall the previous month.In further evidence that South Korean and some European car makers were benefiting at the cost of their Japanese rivals, Hyundai Motor said its China sales climbed 37 percent in October from a year earlier, up from a 15 percent rise in the previous month.Hyundai’s October China tally of 80,598 is more than the 69,715 combined sales of Honda and Toyota for the month, when Toyota’s China sales fell 44 percent.Honda said on Monday that its two biggest China plants would continue to run on one shift, rather than two, until at least the middle of next month, with output then gradually picking up ahead of Lunar New Year in February - a traditional buying season.It has cut its full-year China sales forecast by 17 percent to 620,000 vehicles, but said it would stick to the plan to invest $880 million to expand capacity at its factories in Guangzhou and Wuhan over the next few years.

* VW open to minority holding or controlling stake-sources* VW spokesman declines to comment on speculationBERLIN, July 19 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is considering launching a new bid for Malaysia’s Proton as Europe’s largest car maker aims to tap growing southeast Asian markets in its quest for global dominance, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.VW, which failed in 2007 to form a tie-up with Proton, might seek either a minority holding in the owner of UK sports-car manufacturer Lotus or a controlling stake, two sources said on condition they not be identified.Wolfsburg-based VW assembles the Passat sedan in partnership with Malaysian automotive and property conglomerate DRB-HICOM at the company’s plant in Pekan. VW, which does not have a factory in Malaysia, also plans to produce the Jetta and Polo models at DRB-HICOM’s factory.“Toyota has declared the area as its own backyard,�� said Christoph Stuermer, a Frankfurt-based analyst at research firm IHS Automotive. “But southeast Asia plays a considerable role in VW’s global expansion plan; they can’t afford not to be there.”German publication Manager Magazin reported earlier on Thursday that VW was considering another bid for Proton, noting that its deliberations might even include a full-scale acquisition in the long term.VW spokesman Eric Felber declined to comment on the report.The German car maker, which surpassed Toyota last year to become the world’s second-biggest manufacturer behind General Motors, has a goal of boosting global deliveries to more than 10 million vehicles by 2018.Six-month sales, including the group’s Audi and Skoda brands, rose 8.9 percent to 4.45 million vehicles, putting VW on track to beat last year’s record 8.3 million. Deliveries in the Asia-Pacific region surged 17.6 percent to 1.48 million cars, of which 1.3 million were sold in China, VW’s biggest market.Previous talks with VW foundered partly because of pressure from Malaysia’s former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who, as Proton adviser, said that the company (which was then state-owned) must remain in Malaysian hands. Malaysia’s state investment arm Khazanah sold its 42.7 percent stake in Proton in January to DRB-HICOM for $411.9 million.Underlining its push for world dominance, VW announced a major reshuffle of group and brand managers on June 2 to drive growth in emerging markets and accelerate a planned integration of its truck-making divisions.“It’s our clear goal to continue the successful (expansion)course of past years with great dynamics and stability,�� Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said on June 2.	8.704911487
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India introduced an additional ‘green�� tax on car sales on Monday, aimed at helping fight high levels of air pollution and congestion but hitting car makers that fear this could stall a fragile recovery in the market for their products.In his annual union budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley imposed a sales levy of up to 4 percent on new passenger vehicles, effective immediately, spurring a sell-off by investors in auto stocks like Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors.The tax is another blow for automakers, coming after the Supreme Court temporarily banned the sale of large diesel cars in Delhi, one of the world’s most polluted cities.As a result of the new tax growth in sales in the year to end-March could come in a few percentage points lower than previously expected, said Vikram Kirloskar, vice chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motor, the local unit of Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s largest carmaker.Passenger vehicle sales are expected to rise between 6 percent and 8 percent in the year to end-March, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers estimates as the economy slowly recovers. Yet, in January, passenger car sales fell 0.7 percent from a year ago - the first fall in 14 months.The budget proposes a 1 percent tax on cars less than four metres in length and with engines smaller than 1200cc that run on petrol, liquified petroleum gas or compressed natural gas.Small diesel cars less than 4 metres long and with engines below 1500cc will be taxed at 2.5 percent and bigger diesel vehicles at 4 percent.It is estimated that the tax will generate 30 billion rupees ($439 million) in revenue for the government.Kirloskar said that if the money is used to get cars with older emission technology off the road and to stimulate the production of hybrid and wholly electric cars, “it will be money well-spent and tax well-paid.”R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, which sells one in every two cars in India, said the industry was being unfairly singled out in the fight against pollution.Shares in Maruti Suzuki ended 5 percent lower and Tata Motors Ltd closed 0.7 percent down in a weak Mumbai market that ended 0.66 percent lower.The government, separately, plans to levy a luxury tax of 1 percent on sales of passenger vehicles priced higher than 1 million rupees.While increasing taxes, India is also expected to spend 970 billion rupees over the next fiscal year on improving and building new roads and highways, which car makers say could partially offset the negative impact.($1 = 68.2967 Indian rupees)	-0.08457851706
(Corrects to show strike at suppliers, not at GM plant)* GM says has enough inventories for medium term* No impact at Mercedes Benz, full production at ToyotaCAPE TOWN, July 7 (Reuters) - Workers at components factories supplying General Motors�� South African plant remained on strike on Monday but the auto maker said it had sufficient inventory for both domestic and export customers for the medium term.Over 200,000 members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) stopped work last week demanding salary hikes of up to 15 percent, in a strike that will further hurt the ailing economy.NUMSA has rejected an updated 10 percent offer from employers�� group Steel and Engineering Industry Federation of Southern Africa.“The strike in the metal and engineering sector has impacted upon supply of components to our production line, resulting in our line not being operational since July 3,�� GM spokeswoman Denise Van Huyssteen said. “To date we have lost three days of production.”Mercedes Benz said there had been no impact so far at its local operations, while Toyota said it was still at “full production��.The NUMSA strike comes hot on the heels of another five-month work stoppage by miners in the platinum sector that choked output in the key industry.The union wants any wage hike agreement to apply for a year only but companies want a three-year deal.

NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters-peHUB) - The Gores Group has put Sage Automotive Interiors up for sale more than two years after buying the company, three sources said.Nomura is advising on the process, the people said. Greenville, South Carolina-based Sage develops and makes automotive bodycloth and headliners for car manufacturers including General Motors, Toyota and Honda. Sage produces about $42 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, one of the sources said.First round bids for Sage are due Friday, the second person said. Sage is likely to receive bids of around 7x EBITDA, the source said.The Sage transaction is too small for larger buyout shops but will likely attract mid-market attention. Buyout firms that have invested in auto include Kohlberg &amp; Co, Wynnchurch Capital, the Sterling Group, Insight Equity and Platinum Equity, sources said.Lear Corp (LEA.N), which acquired Guilford Mills in 2012, also could be involved, one source said.Gores acquired Sage in May 2011. The investment came from Gores�� third fund, which collected $2 billion that year.Executives at Lear declined comment. Gores, Sage and Nomura could not be reached for comment.	3.399380223
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s auto market has rebounded smartly from the COVID-19 crash in recent months, executives said on Saturday, as a rare in-person trade show was dominated by talk of recovery in the world’s biggest car market.While conditions have improved vastly from lockdowns that froze economic activity in the country where the pandemic erupted, the Beijing autoshow is a far cry from the usual ebullience as fewer attend, new models are scant and prospects remain uncertain.Doubts remain over the durability of the recovery, but the focus for now is on bright spots such as strong demand for mid-sized to large luxury vehicles and a flood of interest - and investment - in electric vehicles.""The recovery in the Chinese market has been very remarkable, and our key segments have returned to the previous year's level if not slightly better,"" Nissan Motor Co 7201.T CEO Makoto Uchida told a news conference via a video link from Japan. “I expect this rebound to continue, but we need to watch for signs of trouble,�� said Uchida, who announced Japan’s second-biggest carmaker would launch a number of new vehicles in China over the next five years as it struggles to return to profit.China’s auto sales rose 11.6% in August from a year earlier, the fifth straight monthly rise after plunging during the lockdown.When almost all residents were told to stay home in February, sales collapsed by a record 79% to their lowest since 2005.Executives at Germany's BMW BMWG.DE and Guangzhou-based GAC 601238.SS, which has partnerships with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T, forecast full-year sales growth in China, while Chongqing Changan Automobile 000625.SZ predicted the same for its local joint venture with Ford Motor Co F.N.Great Wall Motor Co 601633.SS, China's top pickup truck maker, aims to boost overseas sales this year, helping to ease an overall drop caused by COVID-19.Germany's Audi AG NSUG.DE is in talks with long-term partner China FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] about creating a second joint venture to build electric cars on its PPE platform in China, Germany's Automobilwoche reported.China’s typically busy car-buying season, “Golden September, Silver October��, is off to a good start, according to preliminary data, with passenger car sales up 12% in the first 20 days of September.The rebound means this year’s sales will fall less than 10%, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers estimates, better than its May forecast of a 15% to 25% decline.Much of the upturn is driven by sales of larger passenger cars by makers such as Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and BMW, boosted by new models, automakers' discounts and a broader recovery in the world's second-largest economy. Premium vehicles accounted for a record 15% of the Chinese market in August, up from around 10% for all of last year, the China Passenger Car Association said.Electric vehicles are also providing buzz to the Beijing show, as a boom in Tesla TSLA.O shares has propelled interest in China. EV startups such as Nio NIO.N, Xpeng XPEV.N, Li Auto LI.O and WM Motor have together raised more than $8 billion this year.But the recent improvement reflects Chinese carmakers making earlier model launches as they could not wait for the usual hype from the delayed autoshow before going to market. That suggests a more limited upside to the current sales rise.“This year’s auto sales are very different from previous years,�� said LMC Automotive senior analyst Alan Kang. “Many cars were sold during summer because customers delayed purchases after the lockdown.”Sales of larger sedans and sport-utility vehicles have returned to last year’s levels, but competition among mass-market brands is intensifying, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.That's a key battle ground for international and domestic brands including Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, Toyota 7203.T, and Geely 0175.HK. “Sales performance in these two months will give us a clue of what will happen next,�� said Zhang."	-2.323358577

* Toyota lowers FY sales f’cast by 1 pct, profit unchanged* World’s top automaker cites weak sales in emerging Asia* Q2 profit supported by weak yen, lower costs (Recasts, adds comment, details)TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp cut its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday as the Japanese company expects weaker vehicle sales in emerging Asian countries, where demand for cars has been hit by slowing growth.Slowing sales may knock Toyota from its perch as the world’s biggest selling automaker, a title it has held for the past few months after unseating Volkswagen AG in an ongoing, closely contested race.Hit by a slump in sales in Indonesia and Thailand during the July-September quarter, Toyota lowered its revenue forecast by 1 percent to 27.5 trillion yen ($225.82 billion), citing an uncertain economic outlook in emerging Asian countries.Like many Japanese automakers, Toyota has been enjoying solid growth in the United States, which is on track for a record year of annual sales due to an improving economy and lower gasoline prices.But it is a different story in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other emerging regions, where Toyota has a bigger presence than other car makers, analysts said.“Toyota is more regionally diversified than most Japanese automakers, and the regions where it has a bigger presence than its competitors, particularly in emerging countries, are the ones whose economies are slowing down the most,�� said Takaki Nakanishi, director at auto industry researcher Nakanishi Research Institute.The automaker said that while it expects to hit its annual China target of 1.1 million units, profitability in the world’s largest auto market is likely to worsen due a slowing economy.“The auto market especially in developed economies will remain strong, but Asia may not recover as much as we are hoping to see, so we are more cautious on our emerging market forecast,�� Managing Officer Tetsuya Otake told reporters.Still, Toyota expects revenue including sales and other sources of income to be 1 percent higher than last year, and it kept its operating profit forecast unchanged at 2.8 trillion yen, as the effects of a weaker yen and cost reduction efforts would offset easing volumes and rising marketing-related expenses.Toyota has topped the leader board for global auto sales in the past few months, selling 7.49 million cars worldwide in the year to September, more than No. 2 Volkswagen AG’s 7.43 million during the same period.Operating profit rose 26 percent to 827.4 billion yen ($6.81 billion), just ahead of a consensus estimate, while net profit for the quarter rose 13.5 percent to 611.72 billion yen.Ongoing yen weakness is continuing to bolster profits at Japanese automakers, with Toyota expecting a sluggish domestic currency to add 65.0 billion yen to its bottom line for the year ending March 2016.On Thursday, it raised its full-year dollar/yen assumption rate to 118 yen from a previous forecast of 117 yen. This compares with the yen’s current trading price around 122 yen .Yen weakness and strong U.S. sales are also benefiting Japan’s smaller automakers, with both Fuji Heavy Industries , which produces the Subaru brand, and Mazda Motor Corp both raising their full-year forecasts for sales and profits on Thursday.Toyota said it would continue to investigate Takaka Corp’s air bag inflators and remained committed to using “higher quality�� components, but did not elaborate its position on whether it would keep using air bag inflators made the parts supplier at the centre of a global recall crisis.

TOKYO (Reuters) - China, Japan and South Korea have set ambitious targets to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by the end of the next decade at a cost of billions of dollars.But to date, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have been upstaged by electric vehicles, which are increasingly becoming a mainstream option due to the success of Tesla Inc's TSLA.O luxury cars as well as sales and production quotas set by China.Critics argue FCVs may never amount to more than a niche technology. But proponents counter hydrogen is the cleanest energy source for autos available and that with time and more refueling infrastructure, it will gain acceptance.China, far and away the world’s biggest auto market with some 28 million vehicles sold annually, is aiming for more than 1 million FCVs in service by 2030. That compares with just 1,500 or so now, most of which are buses.Japan, a market of more than 5 million vehicles annually, wants to have 800,000 FCVs sold by that time from around 3,400 currently.South Korea, which has a car market just one third the size of Japan, has set a target of 850,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. But as of end-2018, fewer than 900 have been sold.Hydrogen’s proponents point to how clean it is as an energy source as water and heat are the only byproducts and how it can be made from a number of sources, including methane, coal, water, even garbage. Resource-poor Japan sees hydrogen as a way to greater energy security.They also argue that driving ranges and refueling times for FCVs are comparable to gasoline cars, whereas EVs require hours to recharge and provide only a few hundred kilometers of range.Many backers in China and Japan see FCVs as complementing EVs rather than replacing them. In general, hydrogen is seen as the more efficient choice for heavier vehicles that drive longer distances, hence the current emphasis on city buses.Only a handful of automakers have made fuel cell passenger cars commercially available.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T launched the Mirai sedan at the end of 2014, but has sold fewer than 10,000 globally. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS has offered the Nexo crossover since March last year and has sold just under 2,900 worldwide. It had sales of around 900 for its previous FCV model, the Tucson.Honda Motor Co Ltd's 7267.T Clarity Fuel Cell is available for lease, while Daimler AG's GLC F-CELL has been delivered to a handful of corporate and public sector clients.Buses are seeing more demand. Both Toyota and Hyundai have offerings and have begun selling fuel cell components to bus makers, particularly in China.Several Chinese manufacturers have developed their own buses, notably state-owned SAIC Motor 600104.SS, the nation's biggest automaker, and Geely Auto Group, which also owns the Volvo Cars and Lotus brands.A lack of refueling stations, which are costly to build, is usually cited as the biggest obstacle to widespread adoption of FCVs. At the same time, the main reason cited for the lack of refueling infrastructure is that there are not enough FCVs to make them profitable.Consumer worries about the risk of explosions are also a big hurdle and residents in Japan and South Korea have protested against the construction of hydrogen stations. This year, a hydrogen tank explosion in South Korea killed two people, which was followed by a blast at a Norway hydrogen station.Then there’s the cost. Heavy subsidies are needed to bring prices down to levels of gasoline-powered cars. Toyota’s Mirai costs consumers just over 5 million yen ($46,200) after subsidies of 2.25 million yen. That’s still about 50% more than a Camry.Automakers contend that once sales volumes increase, economies of scale will make subsidies unnecessary.(GRAPHIC: How fuel cell vehicles work: )	-0.9339657059

July 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday gave final approval to the settlement of a class action lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corp by plaintiffs who claimed design defects caused some of the company’s vehicles to accelerate without warning.U.S. District Judge James Selna in California gave final approval during a court hearing on Friday, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. The settlement was initially approved in December.The terms include direct payments to customers as well as free installation of brake-override systems in an estimated 3.25 million eligible vehicles, and the establishment of a customer support program, according to court filings.Plaintiffs�� lawyers valued the deal at more than $1.6 billion, calling it “a landmark, if not a record, settlement in automobile defect class action litigation in the United States,�� according to court filings. The lawsuit was filed in 2010.Toyota, which has the third largest share of the U.S. auto market, announced in December that it would take a one-time pre-tax charge of $1.1 billion to cover the estimated settlement costs. It has denied any wrongdoing.“This agreement allows us to resolve a legacy legal issue in a way that provides significant value to our customers and demonstrates that they can depend on Toyota to stand behind our vehicles,�� Toyota spokeswoman Celeste Migliore said in a statement following the hearing Friday.Concerns about potential unintended acceleration issues caused Toyota to recall more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011. Plaintiffs said in the lawsuit that media reports and consumer complaints about the alleged defects caused the trade-in value for their vehicles to plummet.The settlement of the lawsuit covers economic losses stemming from the alleged safety defects, but does not include claims of wrongful death, personal injury or property damage.More than 22 million potential class members have been notified of the settlement, according to court filings. Owners of affected Toyota, Lexus and Scion models sold in the United States have until July 29 to decide whether to participate in the settlement and file claims, according to court filings.Plaintiffs�� lawyers are seeking $200 million in fees and $27 million for their expenses, the filings said.	-1.611665388

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Investments Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has made to boost its pickup truck and SUV production capacity should help it narrow the gap with the U.S. auto industry average for bigger vehicles increasingly popular with American consumers, a top company executive said on Thursday.Speaking on the sidelines of the Chicago Auto Show, Bill Fay, head of the U.S. Toyota brand, told Reuters that increased production of its Tacoma pickup trucks, RAV4 and Highlander SUVs and its new C-HR crossover vehicle should help bring Toyota to a ��60 percent light truck sales mix this year, from about 52 percent this past year.”He noted that in recent months the industry average for light trucks and SUVs has been around 64 percent of U.S. industry sales - which have shifted substantially away from cars thanks to low gas prices and improved gas mileage for heavier vehicles. Fay said sales of those vehicles as a share of the U.S. total should continue to rise.“We’ll have a leveling out at some point, but we think it has a ways to go,�� Fay said.He said Toyota is not forecasting when it could expect to catch up with the U.S. industry average for SUV and truck sales, adding “but we may not need to catch up to it�� because of the popularity of its Camry and Corolla sedans.“We may always be a brand that’s always a little less light truck and a little higher passenger car because of the strength we have in our passenger vehicles,�� he said. “And that might be OK.��	0.451767207
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Inc is caught in the crossfire of the trade war between the United States and China, as a resurgent yen threatens to sap profits and complicate the economic outlook.Worsening trade friction between the world's two largest economies has reduced investor appetite for risk and boosted assets perceived to be safer bets, such as gold XAU= and the yen JPY=.Japan’s currency is now near its firmest level in eight months against the U.S. dollar, and exporters in the world’s third-largest economy are preparing for pain.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T reported its best quarter in four years last week, but cut its full-year outlook on the yen.“We’re going to be affected by a stronger yen this year, so to offset this as much as possible we have been taking extra measures to reduce fixed costs and cut down on expenses,�� Kenta Kon, a Toyota manager, told a briefing last week.Japanese exporters regularly hedge against currency fluctuations, but a strengthening yen still hurts them because it makes their electronic appliances, semiconductors and cars more expensive overseas. It also decreases the value of overseas earnings when they are brought home.The economy expanded at an annualised 1.8% in the second quarter, data showed on Friday, beating expectations of a 0.4% increase. Robust household consumption and business investment offset the hit to exports, which fell 0.1%.But the outlook for exports could be further complicated as firms are saddled with a strengthening yen.“The escalating U.S.-China trade war and the yen’s rise are negative factors for Japan’s economy,�� said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.“There’s a pretty good chance the timing of a pick-up in exports could be delayed,�� he added.Toyota expects the stronger yen to knock 350 billion yen ($3.3 billion) from its operating profit in the current financial year, roughly double its previous forecast and a big increase from last year’s 50 billion yen impact.The automaker, Japan’s largest company by revenue and market value, expects the yen to average around 106 to the U.S. dollar in the current financial year, against a previous assumption of 110 yen.GRAPHIC: How yen moves impact Toyota's profitability - tmsnrt.rs/2YHLUL7‘NO MAGIC SOLUTION’Other exporters have signalled the possibility of currency pain. Sony Corp 6758.T now expects the yen to average 108 yen this year, from its previous forecast of 110.""There's no magic solution,"" Toshiba Corp 6502.T Chief Financial Officer Masayoshi Hirata told reporters this week, referring to the yen. ""If the yen continues to appreciate we'll have to further improve our cost efficiencies,"" he said.Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T have also flagged the possibility of a cut to profit forecasts if the yen's climb continues.Honda, which relies on the United States for about a quarter of its vehicle sales, last week posted a 16% percent drop in first-quarter profit, partially hit by the yen.The currency is an additional problem for automakers already facing easing demand in many markets, said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA.“Many Japanese automakers are going to have to adjust their profit forecasts simply because things are bad for them in vehicle markets, and the forex issue is the icing on the cake,�� he said.The yen appreciating beyond 105 to the dollar is often seen by automakers as determining whether the currency will mean a significant hit to profit.The currency was at 105.93 to the dollar on Friday.“Given the current uncertainty about what will happen between the United States and China, along with other issues, it’s difficult to revise our forecasts at the moment,�� Suzuki managing officer Masahiko Nagao told a briefing this week.“But we may have to revisit them later in the year, once we have a better idea,�� he added.Some investors and economists worry that the U.S.-China trade war has entered a new phase that will do even more damage to the global economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will impose more tariffs on Chinese imports from Sept. 1.China this week let the yuan slide to an 11-year low, prompting the U.S. Treasury Department to label Beijing a currency manipulator. The trade war has brought forward the next U.S. recession, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters.So far, economists say there are no signs that the uncertainty over the trade war has prompted Japanese firms to rein in investment spending.Still, with global demand cooling, a resurgent yen is hardly what Japan’s exporters - or the economy - need.“The outlook for Japan’s economy is highly uncertain. My main scenario is that Japan can avert a full-blown economic downturn,�� said Dai-ichi Life’s Shinke.“But the risk is clearly tilted to the downside,�� he said."	3.587304063
NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of foreign companies fell on Tuesday, with Europe’s banks giving back recent gains after Moody’s downgraded six European countries and warned it may cut the ratings of three others.The BNY Mellon index of leading American Depositary Receipts fell 0.03 percent, while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index fell 0.6 percent.The ratings news was among factors that sent the euro sharply lower against the U.S. dollar. Euro weakness compared with the greenback has been an important proxy for risk aversion recently, with a selloff in the single currency often pressaging weakness in equities.However, strength in Asia, which appeared to be driven by the effect of the weaker yen on Japan’s big exporters such as Canon Inc and Toyota Motors, offset some of the weakness in the main ADR index.Rating agency Moody’s warned it may cut the triple-A ratings of France, Britain and Austria and it downgraded six other European nations including Italy, Spain and Portugal, citing growing risks from Europe’s debt crisis.Banks were among the biggest losers in Europe. The sector is very sensitive to concerns over the health of credit markets that can increase their funding costs or weigh on their portfolios of sovereign debt. Great Britain’s Royal Bank of Scotland fell 5.9 percent to $8.37 in New York.The BNY Mellon index of leading European ADRs fell 0.2 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed down 0.1 percent at 1069.75 points.The yen fell to its lowest in 3-1/2 months against the dollar after the Bank of Japan boosted its asset-buying program, though analysts cautioned that the yen’s slide could slow as the effect of the monetary easing fades.Canon rose 0.9 percent to $44.70 while Toyota rose 1.1 percent to $79.78.The BNY Mellon index of leading Asian ADRs rose 0.7 percent while the BNY Mellon index of leading Latin American ADRs dropped 0.7 percent.	3.439922481
PT Toyota Astra Motor, a unit of carmaker Astra International , expects to open up to 15 car dealerships this year, adding to its existing 270 dealerships, to expand its market share up to 36 percent, said director Rahmat Samulo.Toyota Astra reported car sales of 1.23 million units in 2013, which represented almost 36 percent of domestic market share.The company’s external affair manager, Bob Azam, said Toyota Astra expects to produce 153,500 cars this year of which 85,500 units will be sold domestically and the remaining 68,000 units will be exported.* Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators on Wednesday expanded the number of vehicles in the United States that may be affected by recalls for potentially defective Takata Corp 7312.T air bags that could spray shrapnel at occupants.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement the number of vehicles from 10 automakers covered by recalls this year and in 2013 is now 7.8 million, up 28 percent from the 6.1 million announced on Tuesday. The NHTSA said the new number corrected the vehicle list provided in prior safety bulletins this week, adding some vehicles and excluding others from previous bulletins.The NHTSA has urged owners of certain Toyota 7203.T, Honda 7267.T, Mazda 7261.T, BMW BMWG.DE, Nissan 7201.T, Mitsubishi 7211.T, Subaru 9778.T, Chrysler FCHA.MI, Ford F.N and General Motors GM.N vehicles to replace installed air bags as soon as possible. In the expanded bulletin, Honda accounts for almost 5.1 million of the vehicles, Toyota 877,000 vehicles, Nissan almost 695,000 vehicles, BMW nearly 628,000 vehicles and Chrysler more than 371,000 vehicles.Also on Wednesday, a top Toyota Motor Corp executive said in Tokyo that the Japanese automaker had no plans to abandon Takata despite the supplier’s struggles.“Toyota’s not one to just dump a supplier,�� Steve St. Angelo, Toyota’s head of Latin American operations and the former chief quality officer in North America, told reporters. “Have we ever eliminated a supplier? Yes. But it’s really, really tough. We will exhaust every opportunity to help that supplier first.”NHTSA is investigating whether Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force could potentially spray metal shrapnel at occupants. They have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.The probe has focused on inflators recovered from cars being recalled for repairs in hot, humid places like Florida. Takata is cooperating with that investigation along with 10 automakers.More than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled because of defective Takata air bags since 2008.Meanwhile, anyone visiting NHTSA’s website at www.safercar.gov on Wednesday to determine whether their vehicle was part of the Takata-related recalls instead received a network error message. NHTSA officials they were trying to determine the issue and consumers can also contact dealers or go online with automakers and use their vehicle identification number to determine recall status.	8.03420326
TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp raised its full-year net profit forecast by 2.6 percent to 780 billion yen ($9.7 billion) even after sales in China, the world’s biggest autos market, virtually halved following a popular backlash against Japan in a territorial dispute.July-September net profit more than tripled to 257.9 billion yen on solid vehicle sales in North America and Southeast Asia, beating an average estimate of 228.8 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year ago, Japanese manufacturers were still struggling from the aftermath of the March earthquake and tsunami.Sales at Toyota and its two Chinese joint ventures dropped 49 percent in September from a year earlier and 44 percent in October. Honda’s China car sales more than halved last month. But, with about 12 percent of its global sales in China, Toyota has lower exposure there than Nissan and Honda.Toyota’s biggest market is the United States, accounting for close to a quarter of its total vehicle sales, followed by Japan. Toyota’s U.S. sales rose 16 percent in October from a year ago, giving it, and its Lexus luxury brand, a 13.9 percent market share, up from 12.3 percent a year ago.Shares in Toyota, valued at nearly $135 billion - almost as much as Honda, Nissan and Hyundai combined - are up by a quarter this year, easily outpacing Honda’s 4.5 percent gain, while Nissan is flat. The benchmark Nikkei share average is up almost 7 percent for the year to date.	4.818684696
* Defensive stocks rally while investors avoid exporters* Can’t tell if selling has hit bottom - traderTOKYO, June 27 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rebounded on Monday as government officials stepped up warnings that they may intervene in currency markets to stabilise the yen after Britain voted to leave the European Union.The Nikkei rose 1.6 percent to 15,189.21 in midmorning trade, after diving 7.9 percent on Friday in the wake of Britain’s historic decision.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he has instructed Finance Minister Taro Aso to watch currency markets “ever more closely�� and take steps if necessary.Abe summoned Aso and Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso to discuss how to deal with the market turbulence caused by Brexit.Traders said that investors remained cautious as they try to assess the impact of the Brexit on Japan’s economy in the long term, and expect the government to take necessary measures to contain any fallout. The yen rose to a more than two-and-a-half- year high of 99.11 yen to the dollar on Friday.“Although it’s rebounding today, we can’t tell if selling has hit the bottom yet,�� said Kenji Yoshikawa, head of equity business division at Mizuho Securities. “We still don’t know if or when measures will come out, and we can’t price that in yet.”While investors avoided investment in exporters that are sensitive to foreign exchange rates, defensive stocks such as pharmaceutical shares and food processors rallied.Takeda Pharmaceutical Co rose 4.1 percent, Astellas Pharma jumped 6.2 percent, while Kikkoman Corp soared 4.9 percent.Automakers extended their drops, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 2.5 percent and Nissan Motor Co shedding 2.2 percent.“These stocks have hit multi-year lows, but even though they seem cheap, people find them risky to invest in due to deep uncertainty in the European region as well as currency risk,�� said Yoshihiro Okumura, general manager at Chibagin Asset Management.Executives at Asian automakers with factories in Britain, including Toyota and Nissan say they could slow investments in Britain or even put them on ice for now.Securities firms stumbled, with Nomura Holdings diving 6 percent and Daiwa Securities stumbling 5.3 percent.The broader Topix gained 1.2 percent to 1,218.92 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 1.3 percent to 11,005.58.	10.28326351

(Adds analyst comments)TORONTO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Auto sales in Canada looked headed toward a record year on Wednesday after a number of automakers broke September sales records.September marked the first time the Canadian market has operated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 million sales, according to a report from DesRosiers Automotive Consultants. The report added that the Detroit Three automakers also took back some market share from import brands during the month.Ford Motor Co reported its highest year-to-date sales in Canada in more than 15 years and Chrysler Canada said it was on track for its best full-year sales ever.Ford took the lead in sales in September, but had the lowest percentage increase in sales among the three Detroit makers.“The market has been ‘on fire�� with this being the sixth month in a row where year-over-year monthly sales records have been set,�� said consultant Dennis DesRosiers in his report, noting that sales volumes in September shattered many company records for the month.“There were some eye-popping performances at an individual corporate level with 10 vehicle companies recording double-digit increases during September.”Ford Canada’s sales of cars and trucks in September rose 5 percent from a year earlier to 27,161, while Chrysler’s rose 20 percent to 23,742. GM Canada’s sales rose 34 percent to 24,555, and Toyota Canada’s were up 6.2 percent at 18,335 vehicles.“As we head into the fourth quarter, 2014 is proving to be a very strong year for auto sales - the industry certainly is on track for a record-breaking year,�� Ford Canada’s chief executive, Dianne Craig, said in a release.In the United States, automakers reported mixed sales for September, an indication that the summer’s rapid growth has eased off. Overall sales for the third quarter were the highest in eight years, however.Ford said the first three quarters of the year were its best in Canada since 1997. Truck sales rose 10 percent, offsetting a 15 percent decline in car sales.Chrysler’s gains were led by sales of its Jeep brand, which more than doubled to 6,782 vehicles from 2,821 a year earlier. Chrysler said sales year-to-date were the highest in its 89-year history in Canada.GM Canada said its sales year-to-date were up 5 percent.Honda Canada sold 15,005 Honda and Acura vehicles during the month, up 8 percent from a year earlier, as it restocked dealerships. Honda Canada had a 4 percent sales decline in August, hurt by shortages.Toyota’s truck sales rose 22 percent from a year earlier, boosted by its RAV4, and set a record for September.Separately on Wednesday, Ford said it will add 1,000 jobs at its Oakville, Ontario, assembly plant, bringing that facility’s workforce to 4,000 by the end of the year.

* Nikkei 0.9 pct higher after previous day’s 5 pct drop* Benchmark index helped by short covering* Toyota, Sony, Keyence rise; Fast Retailing, SoftBank fallTOKYO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei, which plummeted into bear market territory the previous day, ended higher after seesawing on Wednesday, helped by short-covering.The Nikkei share average closed 0.89 percent higher at 19,327.06, barely shaking off Tuesday’s 5.01 plunge - the steepest single-day decline in over two years.The searing sell-off left the benchmark down about 21 percent from a 27-year peak scaled in early October, meaning it’s still in bear market territory entered during the previous session.Nikkei seesawed in afternoon trade, dropping into the red and at one point losing more than 1 percent, before pulling back up in late trading to end the session in positive territory.The broader Topix finished 1.12 percent higher at 1,431.47, but remained down 25.1 percent from a high of 1,911.31 hit in late January.Global equity markets are heading into the year-end under a heavy cloud as concerns over economic growth and U.S. political uncertainty jangled investor nerves.A U.S. government shutdown and President Donald Trump’s increasingly hostile stance towards Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell kept investors well clear of riskier assets.“For short-term sentiment to improve, it’s necessary for Democrats and Republicans to agree on the budget so that the government shutdown will be lifted,�� said Yutaka Miura, chief technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.“I think there is a possibility selling (in Japanese stocks) will resume after rebounding once because the uncertainty hasn’t been resolved completely yet.”On Wednesday, the Nikkei was helped by short covering, Miura said.Shares of some index heavyweights rebounded, with Toyota Motor Co rising 1.1 percent, Sony Corp adding 2.1 percent, Nintendo gaining 1.2 percent and factory automation maker Keyence up 2.9 percent.Other index heavyweights fell, however. Fast Retailing was down 0.9 percent and SoftBank Group shed 1.4 percent.Exporters got a small boost as the yen moved somewhat off a four-month high against the dollar reached overnight, after Japan’s top currency official said Tokyo stands ready to take necessary steps if the market becomes too erratic.Electronics manufacturer Panasonic gained 2.0 percent while construction machinery maker Komatsu advanced 2.4 percent and factory robot maker Fanuc Ltd tacked on 1.9 percent.All but three of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s 33 subsectors were in positive territory, led by precision machinery and air transport.

TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it is recalling around 200,000 hybrid SUVs globally including the Lexus RX400h, due to a glitch in the hybrid system’s inverter.The Japanese carmaker also said on Wednesday it was separately recalling around 169,000 vehicles including the Lexus GS350 and IS350 due to a problem in the engine assembly process.No accidents or injuries have been reported in both cases, Toyota spokeswoman Shino Yamada said.Due to the hybrid system inverter problem, Toyota is recalling around 141,000 vehicles in North America, 37,000 vehicles in Europe and 15,000 vehicles in Japan.The recall affects Lexus RX400h SUVs made between March 2005 and June 2011, and Highlander SUVs manufactured between February 2005 and May 2007. Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand.Transistors used in the hybrids�� inverters could experience heat damage that could force the vehicles to stop, Toyota said in a statement.Toyota will replace a module inside the inverter, which will take three to four hours, Yamada said.Separately, due to a glitch in the engine assembly process, Toyota is recalling the Lexus GS350, made between July 2005 and July 2011, Lexus IS350 manufactured between August 2005 and June 2011, and Lexus IS350C produced between June 2010 and July 2011.In this case, Toyota is recalling around 106,000 vehicles in North America and 59,000 in Japan. In Japan, Toyota is also recalling certain Crown and Mark X vehicles.In the engine, bolts used to secure a device called the variable-valve timing system, which controls camshafts, could become loose. That increases crash risks as it could lead to engine stoppage, Toyota said.Toyota will replace the variable-valve timing system, which will take more than six hours, Yamada said.She declined to comment on how much the recalls will cost.	-0.2387774594
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A new coronavirus that has killed 170 people in China and spread to over a dozen other countries has roiled global commodity markets, raising fears of weaker demand and disrupting raw material supply chains in the world’s most populous country.All but around 100 of the nearly 8,000 cases so far identified have been in mainland China, but the virus has caused global alarm because it is still too early to know how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads among people.The World Health Organisation will meet on Thursday to decide whether its rapid spread amounts to a global health emergency.Oil prices slumped to 3-month lows this week in response to the widening spread of the virus in China, the world’s top oil importer, prompting OPEC to look to extend current oil output cuts until at least June from March, as well as consider deeper cuts if oil demand is badly hit.China is the second-largest oil refiner and a critical growth engine for the global economy, so any material contraction in Chinese economic activity is expected to have far-reaching repercussions across several industries.The aviation sector was a high-profile coronavirus casualty, with scores of flights to and from China cancelled this week.Jet fuel prices and production margins in Asia slumped in response, hurting refiners and fuel exporters..Greatly reduced mobility within China also hit gasoline demand, with Asia’s benchmark gasoline price falling the most in four years on Tuesday.Palm oil prices slumped as much as 10% on Tuesday as traders reacted to the widening shutdowns of offices, malls and factories within China.Palm oil is used mainly in food courts and by catering companies in China, the second-largest palm importer behind India, so reduced consumption is expected over the near to medium term.Base metals have also taken a hit as manufacturing plants and factories take protracted Lunar New Year breaks while they assess the fallout from the virus. Toyota Motor Corp and other firms announced extended plant shutdowns.Industrial bellwether copper fell to near a fourth-month on Thursday and was set for an 11th straight session of losses on fears of an economic slowdown in the world’s top metals consumer.Commodities futures exchanges have also remained shut longer than planned due to the virus, with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) announcing extended closures.Safe haven gold has won some support during a time of uncertainty, hitting a three-week high early in the week, and analysts expect the precious metal to remain bid while worries about the virus persist.For a graphic on Commodities prices under pressure as China grapples with the coronavirus:	-5.932804083
* Nikkei up 0.02%, Topix adds 0.37%* Weak yen helps, but US-China woes, Brexit concerns limit riseTOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japanese shares eked out gains on Tuesday as a weaker yen propped up exporting firms, although negative factors including the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit concerns curbed market sentiment.The Nikkei share average ended the day up 0.02% at 20,625.16, bucking a more bearish trend in Asia.There were 146 advancers on the Nikkei index against 71 decliners.The index seems to have found some support having probed multi-month lows several times over the past month.“The Nikkei looks surprisingly steady, with the 20,500 level for the index proving to be a threshold that attracts bargain hunters,�� said Jun Kitazawa, deputy manager of investment information at Miki Securities.Still, the Nikkei’s gains were modest without leads from the U.S. markets, which were closed on Monday for holiday.Also adding to investor caution was the prospect of more Brexit-related market turmoil.British lawmakers decide later on Tuesday whether to move Britain a step closer to an early election, when they vote on the first stage of their plan to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit.Shares of major exporters advanced as the yen edged further away from an eight-month high marked against the dollar last week.Toyota Motor Corp climbed 0.8%, Subaru was up 2.4% and Panasonic added 0.6%.Nickel-related companies gained as the price of the metal soared to a five-year high on supply concerns with top producer Indonesia announcing curbs on ore exports from January 2020, two years earlier than initially flagged.Sumitomo Metal Mining Co climbed 1.8% and Pacific Metals Co gained 2.7%.Residential and office property firms advanced as a recent drop in long-term bond yields nudged investor money towards real estate offering higher returns.Cosmos Initia Co surged 7.5%, Tosei Corp added 3.3% and Pressance Corp gained 1.8%.The broader Topix gained 0.37% to 1,510.79.The stocks that gained the most among the top 30 core Topix names were Hitachi, which rose 1.8%, followed by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co’s 1.6% gain.The worst performers among the Topix 30 were Fanuc Corp , which lost 2.3%, followed by Keyence Corp, down 1.1%.Share volumes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board were 0.84 billion, compared with the average of 1.1 billion yen in the past 30 days.

NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - American Honda Finance Corp, the U.S. lending arm of carmaker Honda Motor Co Ltd, said on Tuesday that American law enforcement agencies are preparing to charge the finance company with discriminatory pricing of loans made through auto dealerships.The U.S. Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have authorized an enforcement action against American Honda Finance Corp for violating laws that prevent lenders from charging certain borrowers higher interest rates, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The agencies are seeking fines or consumer relief as well as changes to the lender’s pricing practices and policies, but they could defer bringing the action if the company agrees to a “voluntary resolution�� of the accusations, according to the filing.American Honda Finance Corp’s disclosure comes shortly after Toyota Motor Credit Corp, the U.S. lending arm of Toyota Motors Corp, received a letter from the Justice Department and the CFPB accusing it of similar practices.A CFPB spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The company said in the filing that it is cooperating with the agencies and looking to find a “mutually agreeable resolution.”In December 2013, Ally Financial Inc was ordered to pay $98 million to resolve similar accusations from the Justice Department and the CFPB.

BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor supplier Broadcom AVGO.O has made a patent claim for more than $1 billion against Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and is threatening to seek a judicial ban on the production of several car models, German magazine Der Spiegel said on Friday. A Volkswagen spokesman on Friday told Reuters that a legal action had been filed by Broadcom against the German carmaker over a patent issue without confirming the size of the claim.“Volkswagen has examined the claim and taken necessary action to protect its legal interests,�� the spokesman added.Spiegel magazine, which first reported the conflict on Friday, said it concerned the use of 18 patents on Broadcom semiconductors which Volkswagen uses for navigation and entertainment system in some of its cars.Broadcom earlier this year began legal action in the United States against Japan's Toyota 7203.T and Panasonic 6752.T, among other firms, for alleged patent infringement.Lawsuits against Volkswagen have been brought before patent courts in the German cities of Mannheim and Muenster, Spiegel said, adding that Broadcom threatened to seek a provisional ban on the production of the relevant Volkswagen models, as well as some models of its Audi NSUG.DE and Porsche brands. 	7.01845594
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian lawyers filed a class action lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T local unit on Thursday, claiming some models of the carmaker's top-selling vehicles Hilux, Prado and Fortuner were fitted with defective parts.According to a statement on its website, Banister Law, together with Gilbert + Tobin, filed the suit in the Federal Court alleging some vehicles were fitted with defective diesel particulate filters meant to trap and burn soot from the engine.“The affected vehicles ... require time consuming and costly repairs, including repeated vehicle servicing and repeated replacement of the (diesel filters) in its entirety,�� Bannister Law said in the statement.Representatives from Toyota’s Australian unit did not immediately return emails seeking comment.The lawsuit, filed on behalf of customers who purchased the cars between Oct. 1, 2015 and July 26 2019, seeks compensation for the alleged loss and damage suffered by the group, the statement said, without giving any details on the amount.The lawsuit also alleges Toyota made misleading statements because the vehicles “could not, and did not, deliver the advertised combination of durability, reliability, quality, comfort and convenience, and the (diesel filter) in the affected vehicles was not durable, reliable and of good quality��.Toyota’s Hilux is Australia’s top selling car, according to comparison website Canstar.In June, Toyota Motor Corporation Australia posted a 50% increase in after-tax profit to A$206 million ($141.21 million) for the year ended March 31, 2019, according to its website.

* Markets with monetary easing options tend to outperform - analysts* Japan left with few ammunition in case of recession - analyst* Toyota, Honda outperform on report China shifts to hybrid carsTOKYO, July 16 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei fell on Tuesday as slowing economic growth in China hurt investor sentiment, but automakers outperformed on a media report that China will rely more on hybrid vehicles.The Nikkei share average dropped 0.7% to 21,526.21 points by midmorning. Japanese markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday.On Monday, China released data showing its economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure.While more upbeat June factory output and retail sales offered signs of improvement, some analysts cautioned the gains may not be sustainable, and expect Beijing will continue to roll out more support measures in coming months.Traders said that a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy would make the performance gap between Japanese equities and its peers even wider as Japan has little policy ammunition left to support a faltering economy.Japan’s economy expanded an annualised 2.1% in the first quarter but many analysts predict growth will slow in the coming months as the U.S.-China row hurts exports.“Markets whose central banks step up monetary easing tend to outperform these days,�� said Norihiro Fujito, a chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.“While the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are all loosening monetary policies to support their economies, the Bank Of Japan is not left with much choices. Foreign investors are aware of this so they are leaving Japan to shift their money to the U.S. and emerging markets.”The Nikkei has gained 7.6% this year, while the S&amp;P index soared 20% and the European pan-region benchmark index gained 11%.Investors sold futures, triggering index-heavy names such as SoftBank Group, FamilyMart and Fanuc Corp to fall 1.2%, 2.8% and 1.2%, respectively.But automakers outperformed after the Nikkei business daily reported that the Chinese government is set to shift its automotive strategy to rely more on hybrid vehicles.The Nikkei said the move is part of the country’s efforts to clean up the environment, instead of centring solely on electric vehicles, a development likely to work in favour of Japanese automakers such as Toyota Motor and Honda Motor .Toyota rose 1.2%, while Honda shed 0.3%.The broader Topix dropped 0.6% to 1,566.58.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Two more Chinese cities that rely heavily on car manufacturing plan to offer incentives to bolster auto sales, which have been hit by the fallout from the spread of the coronavirus.In the southern city of Guangzhou - where Japanese automakers Toyota 7203.T, Honda 7267.T and Nissan 7201.T all have joint ventures with Chinese partners - the local government plans to reintroduce subsidies to encourage people to buy electric vehicles, it said last week. It did not provide more details. Previous local subsidies were scrapped last year.Xiangtan, a city of 3 million people in the southern province of Hunan, will offer people 3,000 yuan ($429) in cash if they buy a car made locally by Geely 0175.HK, state media Hunan Daily reported on Sunday. Car sales in China, the world’s biggest car market, have been falling for the past two years.In January they dropped 18.7% from a year earlier and the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) expects declines in car production and sales to be more significant in February due to the coronavirus outbreak.According to China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), another industry body, China’s auto sales dropped 89% in the first 23 days of February.The coronavirus has killed more than 2,800 people in China and forced the temporary shutdown of many factories last month.Guangzhou's neighboring city of Foshan - where Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE has a plant with FAW Group [SASACJ.UL] - announced last month that it would offer cash of 2,000 yuan for purchases of new cars and 3,000 yuan for replacement of existing cars.Foshan’s government said it will also offer subsidies to help offset the marketing expenses of auto companies.CAAM expects China’s auto sales will fall by more than 10% in the first half of the year due to the impact of the virus, a senior official told Reuters.China’s commerce ministry said last month that it would study rolling out measures to boost auto sales.	-12.0563635
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T will unveil its plan to become a smaller, more cost-efficient automaker on Thursday as it looks to recover from four years of tumbling profits which are set to culminate in its first annual operating loss in 11 years.The Japanese carmaker’s second recovery plan in less than a year will outline how it will slash fixed costs, streamline its products and shore up cash as it reels from a plunge in sales as the coronavirus pandemic hits demand for cars.Nissan said in April that it expected to post an annual operating loss of up to 45 billion yen ($417 million) when it announces its results for the year to March 31 at 0800GMT on Thursday, which would be its worst performance since 2008/09.The automaker sold 4.8 million vehicles in its latest financial year, the second decline in a row and a fall of 13% from last year, knocking it off its perch as Japan's second biggest automaker to trail Toyota 7203.T and Honda 7267.T.The plan will follow a new strategy announced by Nissan and its partners Renault SA RENA.PA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T on Wednesday to work more closely on developing and producing cars to reduce costs and ensure the group's survival. Even before the spread of the coronavirus, Nissan’s sales and profits had been slumping, forcing it to row back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.The pandemic has only piled on the urgency and pressure to renew its efforts to downsize.Nissan’s operating profit has tumbled for four consecutive years as its pursuit of market share, particularly in the United States, led to overcapacity at its car plants, steep discounting and a cheapened brand.The three-year strategy will lay out a path to sustainable profitability and is the vision of Chief Executive Makoto Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta, who took over after months of internal turmoil following Ghosn’s arrest in 2018.Under the plan, Nissan will curb its ambitions for sales growth to target annual sales of about 5 million units, Reuters reported in April, a cut from a previous goal of 6 million cars outlined in July by then-CEO Hiroto Saikawa.Another top priority will be the preservation of cash. As of December, Nissan’s automotive operations had negative free cash flow of 670.9 billion yen, a more than six-fold increase from a year ago.	-1.145216578

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s normally sleepy shareholder meetings are set for a shake-up this year as a new corporate governance code encourages disgruntled investors to speak out and forces companies to take demands for better returns more seriously.Combined with a separate ""stewardship"" code, which holds fund managers accountable for how they vote, the new rules mean CEOs of poor market performers like electronics maker Sharp Corp 6753.T may face unusually strong dissent in the proxy season starting on Tuesday.“The weight of any opposition vote is now heavier,�� said Nomura Securities analyst Kengo Nishiyama, who specializes in corporate governance issues.The governance code which took effect this month requires listed firms to appoint multiple outside directors and calls for shareholder engagement, addressing longstanding criticism that Japan’s firms neglected investors.It also says companies must consider the views of shareholders who oppose management-backed proposals but are out-voted. While the guidelines are not legally binding, the Tokyo bourse requires listed companies to “comply or explain��.Sharp CEO Kozo Takahashi will come under particularly strong pressure at the company’s June 23 meeting, after weak sales of smartphone displays and TVs forced it to seek a second major bailout from its creditors.Takahashi won 97 percent support for election last year, so a significant drop could raise doubts over his leadership.Toshiba Corp 6502.T, generally considered a well-run conglomerate, is also in hot water as a probe of past accounting irregularities has kept it from closing its books for the year through March and forced it to suspend a year-end dividend.To appease investors, sources have told Reuters, Toshiba is considering a special dividend later.“Individuals and institutions will be pointing to the code, and it will put more pressure on management to have good answers to criticism,�� said Nicholas Benes, an early proponent of the code who heads the Board Director Training Institute of Japan.Even Sony Corp 6758.T, which has doubled its share price in the past year thanks to restructuring and strong sales of sensors, is set for a challenge with criticism from former executives pining for the company's glory days. Proxy advisory firm ISS is also recommending against re-electing CEO Kazuo Hirai as well as Sharp’s Takahashi, citing low return on equity (ROE).Even Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, after another year of record profits, is facing a battle over its proposals for a new class of shares.Proxy advisory firms are giving conflicting recommendations, with Glass, Lewis &amp; Co saying the “Model AA�� share plan will give Toyota more flexibility and ISS saying it would erode fiscal discipline.The California State Teachers�� Retirement System (CalSTRS), the second-largest U.S. public pension fund, says it will vote against the proposal at Toyota’s AGM.Despite the expected rise in dissent, however, investors in Japan are also enjoying the highest returns in years thanks to rising share prices and a drive to boost shareholder returns.In addition to hiring outside directors to meet the code’s guidelines, companies have also been rushing to buy back shares, hike dividends and boost ROE. Tokyo-listed firms will pay shareholders a record of around 14.6 trillion yen, or $110 billion, this year, Nomura’s Nishiyama reckons.Even industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp 6954.T, long known for its cash-hoarding habits and cool treatment of shareholders as much as for its earnings power, is doubling its dividend payout ratio after pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb.But the CEO of BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's biggest asset manager, is urging Japanese companies to think long-term.Companies must “resist the pressure of short-term shareholders to extract value from the company if it would compromise value creation for long-term owners,�� Larry Fink wrote to in a recent letter seen by Reuters."	-1.121688436
WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will announce as early as Tuesday long-held plans to invest about $1 billion in its U.S. factories, following recent criticism of the company by President-elect Donald Trump, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters late on Monday.The largest U.S. automaker is making the decision for business and not political reasons, said the person, who asked not to be identified.The investment will help GM create or retain more than 1,000 jobs, while the automaker also plans to tout other efforts to boost U.S. employment, including adding engineers, the person added.GM General Counsel Craig Glidden told the Wall Street Journal, which reported the company’s plans earlier on Monday, that any investment the company might disclose had been long planned and was not a response to Trump’s criticism.GM declined comment on the investment to Reuters.Since the beginning of this year, GM has come under heavy criticism from Trump for building vehicles in Mexico, as have other automakers. On Jan. 3, Trump threatened to impose a “big border tax�� on GM for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico.At a news conference last week, Trump cited recent U.S. investments by other automakers and said “General Motors will be following, and I think they will be.”Trump, who campaigned hard on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States, said in an interview with German newspaper Bild published on Monday that he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on German car companies�� vehicles imported to the U.S. market.Earlier this month he criticized Toyota Motor Corp’s plans to move production of the Corolla to Mexico from Canada.Auto sales have been rising since 2009 and hit a new record in 2016. Automakers have recently been touting American investments, but say the investments have not been in response to Trump.Last week, Japan’s Toyota said it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said it would invest $1 billion to modernize two plants in the Midwest, creating 2,000 jobs.Ford Motor Co announced this month it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan plant.GM’s “general plan is to build where we sell and we’re focused on what we’re doing in the United States,�� Chief Executive Mary Barra said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Washington on Monday. “We’re a global company so we’re going to continue that focus.”Barra, who told Reuters she planned to attend Trump’s inauguration on Friday, said GM wants to work with him. “I do believe we have more in common than we have areas that we aren’t aligned.”GM, which has more than 40 manufacturing sites in the United States, last year announced $2.9 billion in U.S. investmentsBut even as GM invests in U.S. plants, it has also been making job cuts. In recent months, GM announced plans to lay off about 3,300 employees at three factories.It said in November it would cut about 2,000 jobs when it ends the third shift at its Lordstown, Ohio and Lansing, Michigan plants in January. Last month it said it planned to cancel the second shift and cut nearly 1,300 jobs from its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant in March.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Toyota 7203.T said on Friday its March sales in China, the world's biggest auto market, fell 15.9% compared with a year earlier to 101,800 units.Separately, Honda 7267.T said on Friday its China sales dropped 50.8% year-on-year to 60,441 units last month.The coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 3,300 people in China, caused China’s overall auto sales to drop 79% in February.	-1.396944694
DETROIT (Reuters) - The threat from the coronavirus crisis closed in on the global auto industry on Thursday, as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV warned that a European plant could shut down within two to four weeks if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work.The next several weeks will be critical for automakers. Parts made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled elsewhere, and China’s Hubei province, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.Industry experts said auto suppliers had built up a cushion of parts in inventory and in-transit ahead of the long Chinese New Year holiday in late January. Those will start to run out if Chinese parts factories cannot get back to work next week, or if flights to and from China remain limited.Chinese auto parts and assembly plants have extended previously planned New Year’s shutdowns through Feb. 9. But some have pushed the shutdowns out further.“Almost everybody has some product where they are in trouble,�� said Dan Hearsch, a managing director for the auto and industrial practice of consulting firm AlixPartners.Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said Thursday the automaker could be forced to suspend production at a European assembly plant if parts don’t begin to flow within two to four weeks. He did not identify the plant or vehicles at risk.South Korea’s Hyundai said shortages of parts from China would force it to suspend production at its South Korean plants.Other global automakers have not disclosed details about potential disruptions outside China, but have said they are monitoring the risks. Toyota operating officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi said the automaker is “looking very closely at inventories of components�� outside China.GM has teams working around the clock to head off trouble, the automaker’s chief financial officer said.AlixPartners consultant Hearsch said automakers are more likely than in the past to have backup sources of critical parts. They and their major suppliers took steps after the deadly 2011 tsunami that crippled key auto parts makers in Japan to reduce the risk that a catastrophe at a single factory could shut down assembly lines.Flexible manufacturing equipment can also be reprogrammed or relocated to produce parts. When a fire at a Michigan supplier plant threatened production of Ford Motor Co’s high-profit pickup trucks, Ford moved rapidly to relocate production tools to a plant in Ontario.Still, not all the production from China’s Hubei province can be easily replaced or moved. Hubei is one of 11 Chinese provinces that are responsible for more than two-thirds of vehicle production in China, IHS Markit said in a study last week.If plants remain idled into March, the production losses within China would become significant, amounting to more than 1.7 million vehicles of lost production during the first quarter, IHS projected.	-13.73471969

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035 as the top U.S. auto market shifts to electric vehicles to reduce climate-warming emissions, Governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday.The move is the most significant yet by a U.S. state aimed at ending the use of fossil fuel-burning internal combustion engines, and clashes with the pro-fossil fuel policies of President Donald Trump’s White House.Newsom declared earlier this month he would step up the state’s already aggressive efforts to combat climate change amid a record wildfire season.“We are marking a new course,�� the Democratic governor told a news conference in Sacramento while standing in front of electric cars produced by automakers that support California’s efforts to reduce vehicle emissions.Newsom signed his executive order on the hood of a prototype red electric Ford Mustang Mach-E.The country’s most-populous state is committing to a “firm goal�� to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035 and was encouraging other states to take similar action, Newsom said. California has a broader goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050, but in recent years transportation-sector emissions have increased.The California Air Resources Board (CARB) will turn Newsom’s goal into a legally binding requirement by writing regulations to mandate that 100% of in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks are zero-emission by 2035. The board also plans to mandate by 2045 that all operations of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles be zero-emission where feasible.California accounts for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales, and many states choose to adopt its green vehicle mandates.Newsom characterized the move as an economic opportunity that would create jobs and boost U.S. auto manufacturers.“If you are an American manufacturer, how can you compete globally unless you are in that business? Unless you are pushing the boundaries of innovation?�� he said.Trump has sought to bar California from requiring the sale of electric vehicles, while Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden has pledged to spend billions to speed their adoption.‘WON’T STAND FOR IT’In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere called the move “alarming�� and said it would destroy jobs and raise consumer costs. “President Trump won’t stand for it,�� he said.The Republican president’s economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the measure was “very extreme�� and he did not see others taking similar action. “I don’t think we should be taking any steps to get rid of fossil fuels, he told a White House briefing, “and by the way, there should be consumer choice for all automobiles.”Biden spokesman Matt Hill said electric vehicles could “create a million good-paying union jobs, dominate a fast-growing market worldwide, and meet the demands of the climate crisis.�� But he added that Biden “thinks of it in terms of incentives and investments, not bans.”California said it was joining 15 countries that have made similar pledges, including Britain.California’s clean vehicle goals have not always come to pass and in some cases have been pushed back or reworked.Newsom’s executive order sets a “goal�� of no gasoline-powered passenger vehicles after 2035 and does not prevent Californians from owning gasoline-powered cars or selling them on the used car market.Environmental groups praised the governor’s action on clean vehicles, but automakers were skeptical.A group representing major automakers including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG said “neither mandates nor bans build successful markets.�� It noted that electrified vehicles accounted for less than 10% of new-vehicle sales in California, which is still the best in the United States.Newsom also said he wanted the state legislature to ban new permits allowing use of hydraulic fracturing technology for oil and gas drilling by 2024. Environmental groups had hoped he would ban all new drilling permits in the state.California and nearly two dozen other U.S. states have sued the Trump administration, which has rolled back Obama-era vehicle emissions standards and sought to undo California’s authority to set strict car pollution rules.If the Trump administration order that seeks to bar California from requiring a rising number of electric vehicles is upheld, legal experts say it would prevent the 2035 mandate.The administration has been waging a multi-pronged battle to counter California’s efforts to fight climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses from vehicles.	0.7584376185
TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell to a one-week low on Thursday morning, with precision machinery makers hit by the euro’s weakness against the yen and most sectors in negative territory.The Nikkei dropped 1.7 percent to 21,684.72 in mid-morning trade, its lowest since Feb. 22.The broader Topix declined 1.6 percent to 1,739.62.Investors were worried about the yen’s strength against the euro, adding to overall risk aversion.The euro dropped to 129.86 yen, its weakest level since early September after benign inflation data in the euro zone dented expectations that the European Central Bank will dial back its stimulus.Precision equipment makers Omron Corp and Terumo Corp, which have a relatively big exposure in Europe, fell 2.8 percent and 3.0 percent respectively.Other exporters were also sold down, with Toyota Motor shedding 1.9 percent and Honda Motor falling 1.1 percent.

TOKYO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Japanese shares fell on Monday, tracking the sharp sell-off in Chinese shares on their first trading day after the Lunar New Year break, as worries mounted about the economic fallout due to the coronavirus outbreak in China.The Nikkei index declined 1.10% to 22,956.66 by 0133 GMT, with consumer discretionary and information technology sectors leading declines. The benchmark fell as much as 1.8%, a 10-week low.Chinese markets, which were closed since the end of trade on Jan. 23, reopened on Monday with a decline of 8.06%.The total number of deaths from the virus jumped to 361 as of Sunday, the country’s health authority said on Monday, as several nations suspended flights, evacuated their own citizens and closed borders to Chinese nationals.Economists have already warned the outbreak will weigh on consumer spending, tourism, and factory activity in the world’s second-largest economy, which could weigh on Japan too, as China is one of the country’s top export markets.Meanwhile, Japan’s manufacturing activity shrank for a ninth month in January as output and new orders contracted again, pointing to further strains on the economy, a business survey showed.There were 27 advancers on the Nikkei index against 196 decliners.The largest percentage loser on the index was department store operator Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd, down 5.81%. The company lowered its profit forecasts on Friday after market hours, partly reflecting an expected decline in Chinese tourism to Japan.The second-biggest decliner was auto parts and metals supplier Toyota Tsusho Corp losing 5.74%, followed by Nippon Sheet Glass Co Ltd down by 5.48%.The largest percentage gainers on the index were processed food and healthcare company Ajinomoto Co Inc up 7.09%, followed by building materials maker TOTO Ltd gaining 3.98%, and industrial printing and electronic parts company Seiko Epson Corp up by 3.21%.The broader Topix index fell 0.71% to 1,672.46.The volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board was 0.54 billion, compared with the average of 1.09 billion in the past 30 days.

"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Shell RDSa.L has declared force majeure on fuel deliveries in South Africa's economic hub of Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, due to a two-week strike by more than 20,000 truck drivers, the company said on Friday.“There is fuel available across the country so the issue is not fuel supply but the challenge is delivering it safely to our retail sites,�� Shell said in an emailed response to questions.Force majeure allows the company and its customers to break contracts due to situations beyond their control and its invocation is a sign of the truckers�� strike starting to bite in Africa’s biggest economy, which is already under strain from a wave of wildcat walkouts by platinum, gold and iron ore miners.Near the ""platinum belt"" city of Rustenburg, 120 km (70 miles) northwest of Johannesburg, hundreds of protesters barricaded streets with rocks and burning tyres on Friday close to a mine belonging to top producer Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) AMSJ.J.The unscheduled strikes also spread to manufacturing sector for the first time this week, with workers at Toyota’s Durban car plant downing tools on Monday to demand higher pay. The strike was resolved on Thursday, with unions saying workers had received a 5.4 percent pay hike.“As far as I know the guys have been pitching up for work and production has restarted,�� Toyota SA spokesman Leo Kok said."	4.697554698
* Stock up 8 pct after earlier-than-expected Model S launch* On-time launch of Model S key for investors- analyst* Tesla CEO: Odds of “scaling up�� Toyota deal are goodDETROIT, May 9 (Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc will start delivering its Model S sedan to customers next month, slightly earlier than the electric carmaker had previously projected and a sign of progress for Tesla’s most crucial launch yet.Shares of Tesla shot up 8 percent in trading after the market. The stock closed at $30.06 on the Nasdaq.Tesla has described 2012 as a “year of two halves�� with the Model S launch as the dividing line. Ninety percent of the company’s revenue this year will come from the sedan.Once Tesla finishes crash tests required by U.S. safety regulators, Tesla can begin delivering the sedan to customers in June, slightly ahead of its previous target of July.“Tesla is entering one of the riskiest moments of its company’s history, so anything that supports an on-time launch should be viewed with some relief,�� Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note.Tesla said it has adopted a “slow, methodical�� approach to the launch and expects to deliver 5,000 Model S sedans by the end of 2012. Reservations for the sedan have topped 10,000.“Once we complete and document the tests, we will be able to sell our vehicles in the United States,�� Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a letter to shareholders.Tesla also draws revenue from its partnerships with Toyota Motor Co’s and Daimler AG. In February, Tesla announced an expanded deal with Daimler to create an electric powertrain for a new Mercedes Benz EV.Tesla also makes the powertrain system for the electric Toyota RAV4. Toyota, which unveiled the model earlier this week, said it projects to sell 2,600 of the sport-utility vehicle over the next three years in the United States.Toyota will wait to test the appetite for the all-electric SUV before expanding the partnership, Musk said. But he added: “The odds of scaling up are good.”Also on Wednesday, Tesla reported a first-quarter net loss of $89.9 million, or 86 cents per share, compared to $48.9 million or 51 cents per share a year earlier.Revenue was $30.2 million, down from $49 million last year, reflecting the end of Roadster sales in North America. Tesla expects revenue in the second quarter will be on par with the first quarter.The earlier-than-expected delivery date for the Model S prompted Tesla to lift is revenue outlook by $10 million. It expects full-year revenue between $560 million and $600 million. Earlier, it expected at least $550 million in revenue.	-5.192524771

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc is being probed by a California agency for occupational safety after a report that the electric carmaker failed to disclose serious injuries at a Fremont factory.The state’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) disclosed the inspection on Wednesday, two days after news website Reveal said that Tesla’s omissions in legally mandated reports made its safety record appear better than it was.The probe began on Tuesday, Erika Monterroza, spokesperson for Cal/OSHA, said. The agency typically reviews an employer’s log of work-related injuries and illnesses to make sure that serious injuries are reported directly to the administration within eight hours, she added.A Tesla spokesman said Cal-OSHA is required to investigate any claims, whether they have merit or are baseless.“We have never in the entire history of our company received a violation for inaccurate or incomplete injury record-keeping,�� he said in an emailed statement.The injury rate at the Fremont factory, which it had taken over from General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp, is half what it was in its final years under the previous owners, the spokesman added.	6.195034633

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N will showcase this month a seven-passenger vehicle aimed at young families that features sliding doors and enough interior space to hold roughly 270 soccer balls.But do not call it a minivan.A people-mover version of Ford's Transit Connect commercial van will be smaller, more fuel efficient and less expensive than the minivans sold by rivals Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Ford executives said on Tuesday.Additionally, its design -- with a high roof and squared-off rear -- will not trigger the “soccer mom stigma�� that dogs traditional minivans, particularly among the under-30 set who are beginning to start families, Ford said.“Many of them grew up in the back of a minivan,�� Ford’s head of global engineering Hau Thai-Tang said at a media event.“Historically, different cohort groups tend to reject what they’re familiar with,�� Thai-Tang added. “We think that’s another reason a product like this would be appealing to them.”Ford has been selling the Transit Connect since 2009 as a commercial vehicle with about 35,000 in sales a year. A people-mover version will debut later this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show and will go on sale by the end of next year. The van will be built in Valencia, Spain.U.S. minivan sales peaked in 2000 at just over 1.3 million and today’s sales are about half that. Ford stopped production of its Freestar minivan in 2007, turning its focus to crossovers such as the Flex and the Edge and sport-utility vehicles such as the Escape and the Explorer.Minivan sales have slowed due to a social view that it signals the driver has lost his or her individuality after becoming a parent, analysts and executives say. This distaste is acute among the younger generation known as the Millenials.“It’s not the growth opportunity it once was,�� said Ford marketing manager Tim Stoehr. “The current minivan formula has not evolved to match customers�� changing needs.”Companies have tried to upend this image through styling and marketing. The dominant player in the minivan market, Chrysler Group LLC, launched a sportier version of its Dodge Caravan last year dubbed the “man van�� that featured an all-black interior, wider tires and a stiffer suspension. Caravan sales were up 28 percent through October.In 2010, Toyota launched a popular ad campaign for its Sienna centered around a rapping couple running errands in the suburbs in their “swagger wagon.�� Sienna sales are up 3 percent this year.But the minivans on the market do not offer what customers want in terms of price of fuel economy, Thai-Tang said.“Toyota, Honda and other minivan manufacturers have left today’s customers behind with inefficient people movers that are too large and too expensive,�� he said.The 2013 Sienna starts around $26,400 while the Odyssey starts around $28,500. Ford did not provide the Transit Connect’s price, but said it will cost “thousands less�� than the Toyota and Honda minivans.Ford expects the Transit Connect will get 30 mpg on the highway. It has more than 100 cubic feet of cargo space and will be offered in five- and seven-person configurations with the option of a rear lift-gate or side-hinged cargo doors.(This story corrected capacity in the first paragraph to 270 soccer balls from 465)	12.44601492
(Adds ability to import more models, graphics links)DETROIT, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Foreign automakers with plants in the United States will be able to offer lower vehicle prices as Ford Motor Co faces continued higher labor costs under a new four-year contract with its U.S. union workers.Ford said on Monday a labor cost gap of $8 to $10 per hour will remain with nonunion automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co under the new labor deal. This will allow the foreign companies to offer more attractive options while keeping vehicle prices competitive with the unionized Detroit Three automakers, or charge less for their vehicles.Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the new agreement with 53,000 U.S. workers brings the company’s labor costs on par with crosstown rival General Motors Co and closer to that of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - the other unionized U.S. automakers.Labor costs will rise during the life of the agreement with the United Auto Workers by less than 1.5 percent annually, in line with expected inflation, Ford executives said on a conference call with analysts and reporters.Ford said it will incur $600 million in expenses this year from the new contract.Cost increases will be kept in check by “significantly�� greater use of temporary workers who make less than full-time employees, said Bill Dirksen, Ford’s labor chief. He would not specify the rising number of temp workers.Under the new contract, the UAW must approve the use of temporary workers, which will keep their numbers from rising to the level used at non-union plants.Fields said Ford can leverage its global manufacturing footprint to boost its competitiveness in North America.“In this contract, we’re not restricted from sourcing products anywhere in the Ford world for sale in the U.S. as long as we’re meeting our U.S. sourcing commitment,�� said Fields.While Fields did not specific models, Ford, for instance, could import the EcoSport, a small SUV it makes in several places including Brazil.Ford’s hourly labor costs will rise to $60 from $57, GM’s to $60 from $55, and Fiat Chrysler’s to $56 from $47 by 2019, when the agreements between the Detroit Three and the UAW run out, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an industry consultancy.Last year, Ford’s U.S. labor costs were $9 higher than Toyota’s and $16 higher than Hyundai’s, the consultancy said.UAW Ford workers ratified the new pact on Nov. 20.	-2.287166455
(This Feb 1 story corrects headline to say only Toyota’s sales fell in January, not Fiat’s)(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday reported a 6.6 percent fall in U.S. vehicle sales for January, hurt by lower demand for its Camry and Prius cars.The No.3 automaker in the United States by sales said it sold 156,021 vehicles in January, down from 167,056 vehicles a year earlier. Camry sales fell 3.4 percent, while Prius sales slumped 57 percent, the company said.Auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast January auto sales to decline about 1 percent from the same month in 2018, partly due to uncertainty over the recent government shutdown.The auto consultants also forecast total light vehicle sales this year to fall 1.9 percent to about 17 million units, compared with 2018.However, major automakers are bullish about 2019 sales even as economists warned that rising interest rates may discourage consumers from buying cars this year.General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co , the two big automakers that together commanded a 32 percent market share in 2018, have stopped reporting monthly sales numbers, opting to report on a quarterly basis.Bloomberg, however, reported late on Friday that Ford’s sales rose 7 percent, while GM’s fell 7 percent in January, citing people familiar with the matter. GM declined to comment, while Ford was unavailable for comment.Smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV reported a 2 percent rise in U.S. auto sales for January, helped by higher demand for its Ram pickup trucks and said it expects strong sales in 2019.“In spite of some frigid January weather, we remain bullish on 2019 given the continued underlying strength of the U.S. economy,�� Reid Bigland, Fiat’s U.S. head of sales, said.Fiat said it sold 136,082 vehicles last month, compared with 132,803 units for the same period a year earlier.Sales of Ram pickup trucks surged 24 percent to 39,649 vehicles in January, compared with the same period a year earlier.	-3.645240033
TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo prosecutors plan to release former Toyota Motor Corp executive Julie Hamp from custody after she was arrested last month on suspicion of illegally importing the painkiller Oxycodone into Japan, Kyodo News reported on Tuesday.Japan’s daily Yomiuri newspaper reported Hamp was unlikely to be charged because prosecutors judged there was little criminal intent in the case, in which a family member had mailed Oxycodone pills to her to alleviate knee pain.Kyodo said Hamp, who resigned from her post as chief communications officer last week three months after her appointment as Toyota’s first female managing officer, is set to be released without indictment on Wednesday, the latest she can be held without a formal charge.A spokeswoman for the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office declined to comment on the report.Citing an unidentified source, the Yomiuri said Hamp had stated that she knew the drug was regulated in Japan, but that she did not consider it an illegal drug.Japanese media reports, citing police investigators, had said that 57 addictive Oxycodone pills were found in a small parcel labelled “necklaces�� that was sent from the United States and addressed to Hamp in Japan. The pills were in packets or buried at the bottom of the parcel, which also contained toy pendants and necklaces, they had said.	-2.696781991

(Reuters) - Hyundai Motor, which has lagged its rivals in battery-powered electric cars, aims to leapfrog that technology and roll out what it calls the world’s first production fuel-cell electric vehicles at this week’s Paris auto show.The South Korean automaker is betting that fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) will be a more realistic future auto technology than pure battery electric cars such as Nissan Motor’s Leaf.Those models have struggled to win over drivers as the batteries are expensive, take hours to recharge and can only drive short distances. Toyota Motor this week scaled back plans for its all-electric eQ minicar, saying it misread the market.A fuel-cell converts hydrogen and oxygen into water and generating power to drive an electric motor. Fuel-cell vehicles can run five times longer than battery electric cars on a single power-up, and it takes just minutes to fill the tank with hydrogen, compared with 8 hours or so to recharge a battery.Hyundai, which has watched Toyota make the running with its hybrid Prius model, wants to jump ahead in the fuel-cell market.But it will offer just 1,000 FCEVs, based on its Tucson crossover, from December through to 2015 in Europe as it looks to more than halve production costs to 50 million won ($44,700).Trade media have put the initial sticker price at around $88,000, a hefty price tag for a brand that made its name with cheaper, feature-filled models.While fuel-cell electric cars may go further, manufacturers still have to wrestle with the high cost of production - double or triple that of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) - and a lack of refueling infrastructure.“We aim to reduce prices of fuel-cell vehicles to match battery cars by 2020-25,�� Lim Tae-won, the director in charge of fuel-cell research at Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Motors, told Reuters ahead of the Paris auto show.He said fuel-cell cars would overcome the “range anxiety�� - or fear of running out of power far from a charging point - of battery-electric cars if the refueling issue was resolved.A 2008 McKinsey study of 11 global carmakers predicted as many as 1 million fuel-cell electric cars on Europe’s roads by the end of the decade, but industry experts caution demand will depend on customer acceptance of the technology, government aid and, crucially, the availability of hydrogen filling stations.“The great thing about a battery powered electric car is that power sockets can be found anywhere,�� said Andreas Winckler, managing director of the services unit of Frankfurt trade fair operator Messe Frankfurt Medien und Service GmbH, which has leased both battery and fuel-cell electric cars from Mercedes-Benz since November.“Before we installed the first charging stations here, we just opened a window and ran an extension cord out to the car.”Winckler noted there was just one hydrogen filling station in the entire Rhein-Main region around Frankfurt, continental Europe’s financial hub, but it had been broken for weeks. “That’s clearly the big dilemma with fuel-cell cars,�� he said.Hyundai’s Lim said it would cost more to develop a hydrogen refuelling infrastructure than one for electric battery charging, but each hydrogen station would process more cars as it would take just minutes to fill up.German industrial gases producer Linde is investing tens of millions of euros with Daimler to build 20 hydrogen filling stations by 2015. For now, Germany has only seven.The aim is to bring down the cost to that of a natural gas filling station, around 300,000 euros ($387,500), from around 1 million euros today, said Ulrich Buenger, a coordinator at the European Hydrogen Road Tour 2012, which is funded by industry and the European Commission.In Seoul, Lim predicts fuel-cell will ultimately become the leading alternative fuel technology, though hybrids will dominate during that transition. For now, Toyota is alone in increasing sales of hybrid-electric vehicles, while General Motors, Nissan and others have struggled to live up to the hype with their early battery electric models.“Battery electric car makers entered the market too early without resolving problems such as range anxiety and costs,�� Lim said. “It was a hasty approach. The battery electric cars may have helped raise brand value for a couple of years, but ended up slowing down the take-off in the market.”Hyundai’s production-ready fuel-cell electric vehicle can run as far as 588 kms (365 miles) on a full charge, similar to traditional gasoline vehicles, Lim said, while Nissan’s Leaf can drive only up to 73 miles per charge.Toyota slashed its plans for the eQ to sales of just 100 in Japan and the United States from previous forecasts of several thousand, saying battery technology could not live up to consumer demands. “The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society’s needs, whether it’s the distance cars can run, or the costs, or how long it takes to charge,�� said Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota’s vice chairman, adding that fuel-cell vehicles looked to have more potential.“The biggest problem is how automakers bring down costs and how much infrastructure will be in place,�� he said.Hyundai hopes to get a jump on its rivals by offering 1,000 of its FCEVs, overtaking Daimler and Honda Motor, which have leased only small numbers of their fuel-cell vehicles - the Mercedes B-Class F-Cells and FCX Clarity, respectively. By 2015, Hyundai aims to have the capacity to build 10,000 FCEVs, rising to 100,000 in 2020, when it expects the loss-making business to achieve “economies of scale,�� Lim said.Toyota plans to launch sedan-type fuel-cell electric vehicles from around 2015, and predicts sales in the tens of thousands by the 2020s. Nissan is working on a fuel-cell vehicle with Daimler for 2016 and will also unveil a concept fuel-cell sport utility vehicle, the TeRRA, in Paris.GM shifted funding from fuel-cells to push Chevrolet Volt electric car with range extender, but sales have been sluggish.In a KPMG global survey of 200 auto executives, one in five expected fuel-cell electric cars to attract more consumer demand than pure battery electric cars in 2025. Sixteen percent went with battery cars. Hybrids, including plug-ins, provide the best mid-term solution, the survey, published in January, showed.($1 = 1119.3250 Korean won) ($1 = 0.7699 euros)	-1.665183679
"HANAM, South Korea (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS will launch its standalone premium auto brand Genesis in China within two to three years, betting on a luxury lane to profit as competition bites at the lower end of the world's biggest auto market. Genesis brand chief Manfred Fitzgerald told Reuters in a recent interview the company is considering building Genesis models in China ""For sure. But there are also other examples of (automakers) who live pretty well off of importing cars,"" he said, citing Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus.The plans come as Hyundai tries to reverse out of 10 straight quarters of falling profit, hit in part by weakness in China.Rolling out Genesis in key markets like China marks a shift for a company better known for making value-for-money cars and lacking the brand cachet and tradition of Germany's BMW BWMG.DE, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. That trio dominates the luxury market globally - and in China.“The luxury customer in China is very brand-conscious,�� said U.S. national Fitzgerald, 53. The former executive with Audi’s Lamborghini brand was speaking at the first, and so far only, standalone Genesis store, in a glitzy mall in Hanam on the outskirts of Seoul featuring cars like G80 sedans that can fetch up to 74 million won ($67,100).“If you don’t get your brand right, you can have the best product in the world, it won’t work,�� said Fitzgerald. “In two, three years�� time we will be entering China,�� he said, declining to give sales targets for a global rollout that will follow launches in Korea late last year and in the United States last month.In China, imported cars carry a duty of more than 20 percent, putting pressure on automakers to produce locally.Genesis will open more standalone outlets, said Fitzgerald, and is exploring unspecified locations for its first U.S. store. The Genesis line-up currently features two models, a range that the company plans to expand to six by 2020, including two sport utility vehicles.Consultants like Eric Noble, president of California-based consultancy CarLab, say getting the sales channel right for premium cars is as important as the product itself.For now, over 300 of Hyundai’s more than 800 U.S. dealerships will also be selling the Genesis brand, posing an added challenge for differentiating it from Hyundai. By comparison, Toyota’s Lexus is sold through separate dealerships.“From a product standpoint, the prospects of the (Genesis) brand are encouraging,�� said Noble. “But from a distribution standpoint, at least here in North America, it is much more problematic.”�TIPPING POINT’Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo, now 78, took the helm in 2000 and turned Hyundai and its Kia Motors 000270.KS affiliate into the world's fifth-largest automotive group by making inexpensive but reliable small cars.But the veteran’s 45-year-old son and vice-chairman Chung Eui-sun has sought to move Hyundai up the value chain. He spearheaded the move last November to hive off the Genesis sedan into a standalone brand, tapping a segment growing faster than the mass market to generate higher margins.Fitzgerald said meeting with the younger Chung was a “tipping point�� in his decision to join a company long known for promoting from within.“He definitely gave me the feeling that no matter how long and how troublesome and how tedious this might be, they are in for it and they want to succeed.��($1 = 1,102.6100 won)"	-1.878293388
(Adds results from Ford and Toyota, total sales, and quote)Oct 1 (Reuters) - Auto sales in Canada rose 3.7 percent in September, according to data compiled by DesRosiers Automotive Consultants on Thursday, a sign that parts of the economy are strong even though the broader Canadian economy contracted in the first half.Total light vehicle sales rose to 174,337 cars and trucks, as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co all reported higher Canadian sales for the month.“This week Statistics Canada released a positive report on the Canadian economy that exceeded expectations,�� DesRosiers wrote in a note. “September auto sales confirms that parts of our economy are indeed performing strongly.”The data came as the major U.S. automakers reported a jump in September sales, boosted by cheap gasoline and ultra-low interest rates.Ford sales rose 3.9 percent in Canada to 28,215 vehicles, recovering from a 5 percent year-over-year decline in August, as a 5.6 percent gain in truck sales more than offset a 3.9 percent decline in car sales.Fiat Chrysler’s Canadian sales rose 1.1 percent to 24,007 vehicles.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Wednesday it has ordered the recall of more than 80,000 vehicles sold in Mexico to check for potential defects stemming from air bags made by Japanese company Takata Corp.A total of 84,671 autos have been recalled this month, a company spokesman said. The vehicles were made between early 2011 and late 2014, according to figures published on the website of Mexico’s consumer protection agency (Profeco).Nissan is not the only automaker to act. Honda Motor Co Ltd , BMW and Toyota Motor Corp have also ordered recalls over the air bags this month, according to Profeco. The three companies have recalled a combined total of nearly 75,000 autos, the agency said.More than 20 million vehicles have been recalled worldwide since 2008 because of defective Takata inflators, which have been linked to five deaths.Separately, the Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA) said automakers and government officials have held meetings about potential problems with Takata air bags in recent weeks.AMIA added that the companies “have begun to take necessary steps on their own to determine whether vehicles sold in Mexico could be affected,�� but did not provide further details.	1.692780096
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it would recall 57,000 vehicles globally to replace potentially deadly air bags made by Takata Corp, as a safety crisis around the Japanese auto parts maker looks far from being contained.Toyota’s action follows a recall by rival Honda Motor Co for the same problem two weeks ago after revelations of a fifth death, in Malaysia, linked to Takata’s air bag inflator. More than 16 million vehicles have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata’s air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray metal fragments into the car.Toyota is recalling some Vitz subcompacts, called Yaris in some markets, and RAV4 crossover models made between December 2002 and March 2004. About 40,000 are in Japan, 6,000 in Europe and the rest in other markets outside North America. Toyota said it was not aware of any injury or death related to the recall.Separately, Toyota’s small-car subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co also issued a recall, in Japan, of 27,571 Mira minivehicles produced between December 2002 and May 2003 for the same reason - its first recall involving Takata inflators.About 2.6 million vehicles have been recalled in Japan so far for Takata’s air bag inflators, a transport ministry official said.Takata-related recalls are almost certain to balloon after U.S. safety regulators on Wednesday ordered the company to expand a regional recall of driver-side air bags to cover the entire United States, not just hot and humid areas where the air bag inflators are thought to become more volatile.Takata has so far resisted expanding the recall, saying that could divert replacement parts away from the high-humidity regions that need them most.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has given Takata until Tuesday to issue a nationwide recall, and could fine it up to $7,000 per vehicle if it doesn’t comply. It remains unclear how many more vehicles that would add, but it could be in the millions, affecting five automakers: Ford Motor Co, Honda, Chrysler Group LLC, Mazda Motor Corp and BMW AG.A U.S.-wide recall of driver-side air bags could cost an estimated 70 billion yen ($600 million), Nomura Credit Research analyst Shintaro Niimura wrote in a Nov. 26 report.“Takata could need nearly 200 billion yen ($1.7 billion) of reserves in the event of a U.S. nationwide recall (including passenger-side air bags), and the company’s cash-on-hand would be tightly squeezed,�� he wrote, noting Takata had just 8.33 billion yen of cash and deposits.“If the company makes any missteps, we cannot say that there is ��zero�� chance of the company dying a sudden death - that is, being hit with excessive debt or facing a cash-insolvency bankruptcy,�� Niimura added.NHTSA’s action and the latest recalls come on the heels of an announcement by Japan’s transport ministry on Wednesday that it received a report of an “unusual deployment�� of a Takata air bag as it was being removed from a scrapped car on Nov. 6. The inflator was manufactured in January 2003 at Takata’s Monclova, Mexico factory, and had not been subject to recalls, at least in Japan, raising the prospect of an expanded recall, the ministry said.A Toyota spokesman said the scrapped car was a 2003 Will Cypha, a Japan-only compact model that is no longer in production. Toyota said it was investigating the issue as part of its wider probe into Takata’s air bag inflators. “We will take prompt and appropriate action if we find there is a need for a recall as a result of the investigation,�� it said.Takata shares dropped as much as 7.9 percent in Tokyo on Thursday, closing down 4.8 percent. Toyota shares eased 0.5 percent and Daihatsu shares slipped 1.2 percent, roughly in line with the broader market. Shares of Honda, Takata’s top customer, underperformed other auto stocks, falling 3.3 percent.Honda had said the Takata air bag inflator that failed in the Malaysia crash had likely been exposed to excessive moisture at the supplier’s now-shuttered plant in LaGrange, Georgia. A transport ministry official said no further recalls are expected in Japan related to the problem identified at the LaGrange line between November 2001 and November 2003.A second U.S. congressional hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, where representatives from Takata, NHTSA and several automakers will testify.($1 = 117.3600 yen)	3.443514984
* Japan quake, Thai floods hit Honda harder than others* Q3 op profit seen down 35 pct y/y - Reuters poll* Investors eager for Honda to renew earnings guidance* Consensus sees FY profit down 50%, better than previous guidance* Shares outperform as investors focus on recovery aheadBy Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co is expected to report a double-digit slide in quarterly operating profit on Tuesday and forecast a still larger drop for the full year, as natural disasters in Japan and Thailand hit it harder than rivals.Japan’s No.3 automaker was the slowest to recover from supply-chain disruptions after the earthquake and tsunami in March, while it was alone in having a car factory inundated by the historic floods in Thailand, Southeast Asia’s export hub.That is expected to push Honda’s October-December operating profit down 35 percent to 81 billion yen ($1.06 billion), according to a poll of nine analysts by Reuters.Honda’s announcement is being closely watched after the company withdrew its guidance in October citing uncertainty over when production could resume in Thailand. Honda is the first Japanese automaker to report third-quarter earnings, and is also expected to provide an update on Thai production on Tuesday.In 2011, Honda’s global output dropped by a fifth to 2.909 million cars, slipping below 3 million for the first time in eight years. All other Japanese automakers, except Nissan Motor Co, built fewer cars also, but the falls were much smaller than at Honda.For the year to March 31, 2012, forecasts from 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S put Honda’s annual operating profit at 283 billion yen, down 50 percent from 2010-11 when it was hit by the yen’s rise against the dollar and euro.The consensus forecast is slightly higher than the 270 billion yen Honda projected in August.With production steadily recovering in the final months of 2011, investors have turned their attention to an anticipated jump in sales as Honda restocks its depleted inventory.So far this year, its shares are the best performer among Japanese automakers, rising 14.2 percent as of Monday. Tokyo’s auto sector index has gained 8.9 percent.Still, concern has lingered over whether Honda might be losing its edge after a new version of its top-selling Civic was heavily criticised for its styling and interior in the United States, its biggest market, last year.Competition in the United States is set to heat up this year as resurgent local giants Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co and South Korea’s fast-rising Hyundai Motor Co flex their muscles in the sedan segment previously dominated by Honda and Toyota Motor Corp.While acknowledging the criticisms of the revamped Civic, Honda Chief Executive Takanobu Ito stressed this month that the car had topped the country’s compact sedan segment in the latest quarter, outselling Toyota’s Corolla.Honda is targeting a 25 percent jump in its U.S. sales this calendar year. To this aim, it is shoring up its struggling Acura premium brand.Honda is scheduled to announce its results at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) in Tokyo.Domestic rivals Toyota and Nissan are scheduled to announce third-quarter earnings on Feb. 7 and 8, respectively.	13.05117039
TOKYO, July 7 (Reuters) - Many companies in the Chubu central Japan region, home to auto giant Toyota Motor Corp , are resilient to currency swings and have not been affected much by short-term rises in the yen, a senior Bank of Japan official said on Thursday.The market turmoil triggered by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has not hurt corporate capital expenditure, which remains “quite strong,�� Kimihiro Eto, the BOJ’s branch manager overseeing the Chubu region, told a news conference.

(Reuters) - For the first time in 27 years, a nonluxury brand, Kia Motors, 000270.KS scored tops in the annual initial quality study of new vehicles sold in the United States by J.D. Power, the business consultancy said.For only the second time in the study’s 30-year history, American brands got better marks collectively than their non-domestic counterparts.And in another surprising result, the 2016 J.D. Power study showed that for the first time in a decade, owners of vehicles from non-premium brands reported fewer problems than those who own the more expensive cars, SUVs and pickup trucks.“Expected reliability remains the most important consideration purchasing a new vehicle,�� said J.D. Power.Kia was first among 33 car brands in the study, moving up from second place a year ago. Porsche, a sports luxury brand owned by Volkswagen AG, VOWG_p.DE was second after finishing first a year earlier.At the bottom was Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Smart minicars, which scored well below next-to-last Fiat, and third-to-last Volvo VOLVb.ST.J.D. Power received more than 80,000 surveys from owners of 2016 model year new vehicles in the first 90 days of ownership. In a 233-question survey, the owners reported problems encountered with their purchases.Rounding out the top 10 highest-ranked vehicle brands, in order, were Hyundai Motor Co, 005380.KS Toyota Motor Corp, 7203.T BMW, BMWG.DE General Motors Co's GM.N biggest brand Chevrolet, and three in a tie, GM's Buick, Toyota's Lexus, and Ford Motor Co's F.N Lincoln luxury brand.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MIFCAU.N brands Jeep and Chrysler were the most improved in the study, J.D. Power said.	-0.2455661664
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co. 7203.T is back on its feet after a year marred by natural disasters, recapturing its crown as the world's top-selling carmaker and looking to raise its 2012 production and sales forecasts.The company is expected to report on Friday its biggest quarterly operating profit in four years, marking a full comeback from the disruption that followed last year’s huge earthquake and tsunami in Japan and flooding in Thailand that disrupted supply chains.The challenge now, analysts say, is whether the outsized sales gains Toyota has seen in its biggest markets can be sustained in the quarters ahead.On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expect Toyota to book an operating profit of 314.1 billion yen ($4 billion) for the three months to June, compared with a year-earlier loss. They also forecast an operating margin of about 5.7 percent, up sharply from the 1.9 percent margin recorded for the fiscal year ended in March.That would still leave Toyota below the performance of its peak year that ended March 2008, before the global financial crisis hit sales and quality and safety problems forced it to recall some 19 million vehicles starting in 2009.“While they are meeting a lot of challenges and improving, the yen is still a phenomenal problem for them,�� said Kurt Sanger, auto analyst at Deutsche Securities.“Are they doing things to make themselves better? Clearly. At 80 yen to the dollar and with their Japan exposure, can they be the best? Very difficult.”Toyota has set a goal to keep building 3 million vehicles a year in Japan, leaving it more exposed to the stronger yen than its direct rivals. Toyota builds about 40 percent of its cars and trucks in Japan compared with about 25 percent for domestic rivals Nissan and Honda.As a result, a one yen gain against the dollar would shave 35 billion yen off Toyota’s operating profit, compared with 20 billion for Nissan and 17 billion yen for Honda, the companies said three months ago. The currency has appreciated to around 78 yen per dollar from more than 120 yen five years ago.Analysts expect the yen to remain a drag on Toyota’s profitability, even as sales snap back from the depressed levels of 2011.Toyota regained the crown as the world's best-selling carmaker from General Motors GM.N in the first six months of 2012.It is expected to raise its full-year global sales forecast to 8.8 million vehicles from the current level of 8.58 million, and its global production forecast to nearly 9 million vehicles from 8.65 million, the Nikkei business daily and other domestic media outlets reported. Toyota declined to confirm the reports.In its biggest and most profitable market, the United States, Toyota sales have snapped higher by 28 percent through July, the biggest gain for any major automaker. The sales gains have been combined with higher transaction prices, reflecting strong demand for the Prius hybrid and the Camry sedan, the top-selling car in the United States.Some analysts say Toyota is likely to be able to retain its top sales position worldwide. But there are risks.“To date, Toyota faced supply shortage and it has been supplying products and introducing new models to catch up, which led to an increase in vehicle sales. But it’s difficult to think that sales will continue to grow with the current momentum,�� said Kunihiko Shiohara, a managing director at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.Both Nissan and Honda, which released their quarterly earnings in late July, underperformed analyst expectations, citing the strong yen and costly sales incentives as they tried to shift older models before putting revamped models on sale.For the full fiscal year ending March 2013, Toyota has forecast an operating profit of 1 trillion yen and a net profit of 760 billion yen. Toyota will release its quarterly results at 0600 GMT on Friday.($1 = 78.2400 Japanese yen)	-2.874414014
TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp more than doubled its fourth quarter net profit, as the yen’s depreciation helped the automaker export more profitably and U.S. sales of the Avalon sedan and Tacoma truck were strong.In the quarter ended March 31, the world’s best-selling automaker posted net profit of 313.9 billion Japanese yen ($3.17 billion), compared with 121 billion yen in the same period last year.The fourth-quarter figure was above an average forecast of 258.9 billion yen net profit among five analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	-2.205513784

BEIJING, April 18 (Reuters) - Big may be beautiful, but Toyota Motor Corp’s global design chief is betting that edgy is the way to go for the Japanese automaker’s premium Lexus brand, specifically its signature ��spindle grille�� design.Tokuo Fukuichi, who is also Lexus�� global chief, says the design shock-therapy gives the brand - and conservative Toyota more broadly - the stand-out face it previously lacked.While some industry rivals and design experts say the jagged-edged, trapezoid grille is downright ugly, 63-year-old Fukuichi stands by the drastic makeover, saying it will give Lexus a “unique�� edge over German rivals BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz particularly in competitive emerging markets such as China, where buyers will pay more for a car that stands out from the crowd.Fukuichi, who was brought back to Toyota from a subsidiary in 2011 and as he was recovering from cancer, says Toyota for too long designed cars by committee - often of several dozen people. “The upshot was styling conservatism which everybody tolerated, but nobody was passionately in love with. We tried to please 10 out of 10 people. Now we’re trying to please one of 10 people out there with Lexus.”�When CEO Akio Toyoda asked me to come back, he told me he wanted to make our cars cool. That meant he thought our cars weren’t sexy,�� Fukuichi added, explaining his introduction back then of the head-turning grille.In an interview ahead of next week’s Shanghai autoshow, Fukuichi said Lexus was still not at “a gold medal winning level on the global stage,�� versus leading German brands and the likes of Jaguar, Maserati and Aston Martin.Fukuichi is no stranger to controversy. In the late-1980s, he caused a storm with Toyota’s first-generation Previa multi-purpose vehicle, which was dubbed the ‘egg van�� because of its quirky rounded styling.“Even polarizing designs, you get used to them after a while,�� he says.The designer’s credo is to take a risk to stand out from the competition - like a movie star playing on what others consider a flaw in his looks in an industry where the generic drop-dead fashion model doesn’t linger long in the memory.For Lexus, that flawed look is the spindle grille, which made its quiet, tentative debut in the Lexus CT in 2010 and was later incorporated into the redesigned Lexus GS.It upset more than a few. At a mid-2012 shareholders�� meeting, one angry Toyota shareholder complained the new Lexus “face�� was giving the brand a bad reputation. Even some Lexus insiders likened the new look to an ugly deep-sea creature.Others outside joined in the criticism. A former Rolls Royce designer said the pinched-in-the-middle spindle grille was a “design no-no�� as it created an “uncomfortable�� tension in the lines and shape of the car. A U.S. design professor said the controversial grille looked like the mouth of the Predator, an alien sci-fi movie character.But the radical look had its fans, too. A senior Nissan Motor Co designer said the company’s Infiniti premium brand quietly dropped plans to adopt a similar spindle grille profile because Lexus beat them to it.And the opinion that really counts - at showrooms - appears positive. Lexus�� global sales have grown 42 percent since 2010 to 583,000 vehicles last year.Fukuichi remains philosophical about his bold design.“I had nothing to lose except my life. I was ready to quit any time and retire if it didn’t work,�� he said. (Editing by Ian Geoghegan)	0.5045772364
(Reuters) - The United Auto Workers filed on Friday for an election by 165 skilled trades workers at the Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE auto plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the labor union said.The filing for the election was made with the National Labor Relations Board. Federal law allows a portion of a work location to be represented by a union, the UAW said.No date has been set for another election, a UAW spokesman said. The union lost an election to represent all 1,500 hourly production workers at the plant in February 2014.A Volkswagen spokesman acknowledged the filing and said the company was pleased with its current involvement with the union as well as the workers affiliated with the anti-UAW American Council of Employees.Gary Casteel, UAW secretary-treasurer and head of the union’s effort to organize non-union auto plants, said VW’s current form of recognition that allows union access to management on plant issues was short of the right that the union desires to collectively bargain for workers.“Volkswagen’s policy in Chattanooga was a gesture and our local union has engaged accordingly,�� said Casteel. “At the end of the day, the policy cannot be a substitute for meaningful employee representation and co-determination with management.”The Chattanooga plant is viewed by the UAW as its best chance to organize a foreign-owned plant in the southern United States. German, Japanese and South Korean companies have plants in the region where most states are so-called “right-to-work,�� where union membership cannot be a requirement of employment.Volkswagen, which has a history of worker recognition through German-styled works councils that include blue- and white-collar employees at its plants around the world, has been the least hostile foreign automaker to the union.The UAW is in talks for a new four-year contract with General Motors Co after the union’s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV membership ratified a new deal for 40,000 U.S. union workers.Labor analysts have said that pay and benefits for union workers at the Detroit Three automakers influence labor costs for non-union southern U.S. plants of Volkswagen, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors.Regarding pay, labor analyst Arthur Schwartz said the non-union plants, “don’t want to get too far out of whack because that would invite the UAW in. Georgetown in Kentucky (where Toyota has a large plant) has basically tried to keep pace and so far it’s worked.��	-1.76334477
* Top six automakers report mixed results* Annualized sales rate rebounds from February dip* Ford beats expectations; GM, Honda miss expectations (Adds GM, Ford share prices)DETROIT, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer demand for new vehicles strengthened in March, especially for luxury cars and big trucks, but not every carmaker participated in the uptick.New-vehicle sales rose 0.6 percent from a year ago, to 1,545,802 vehicles, industry consultant Autodata Corp said. Automakers had one fewer day and one fewer weekend in which to sell than during the year-ago month.Among the strong performers were Toyota Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Audi.While dealership traffic began to pick up last month, “the second quarter looks to be even more favorable�� because of pent-up demand after a harsh winter, according to Eric Lyman, vice president of industry insights for research firm TrueCar Inc.The annualized sales rate rebounded sharply in March, to 17.15 million vehicles, from 16.2 million in February.Last month’s sales were driven in part by German and Japanese luxury brands, as well as by a strong appetite for big trucks and SUVs from Detroit manufacturers.Results varied by company, with only three of the top six automakers beating analysts�� expectations and only two exceeding their year-earlier sales.Only Toyota managed to do both. Its sales rose 4.9 percent, to 225,959 vehicles. Analysts had expected 223,280.March was a strong month, said Bob Carter, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota’s U.S. sales arm. Demand for trucks and SUVs is driving the market, he said. “Every one of our light trucks ... is supply-restricted.”Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said sales were up 1.7 percent, to 197,261, in line with expectations.Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co beat expectations, but their sales fell from a year ago. Ford was down 3.4 percent, to 235,929, while Nissan dropped 2.7 percent to 145,085.General Motors Co and Honda Motor Co missed expectations, as sales dipped at both companies. GM was down 2.4 percent, to 249,875, and Honda fell 5.3 percent to 126,293.Domestic luxury vehicle sales were soft in March, with the notable exception of the full-size Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicles.Most foreign luxury brands saw year-to-year gains of 1 to 20 percent in March.Ford and Chevrolet amped up the stakes in full-size pickups, with dealers offering discounts of up to $9,000 on 2015 models and $12,000 or more on leftover 2014 models.Despite the hefty price rollbacks, sales of Ford’s best-selling F-Series pickup dropped nearly 5 percent in March. At GM, Chevrolet Silverado sales were up 7 percent.Analysts said rising consumer sentiment in March was reflected in higher vehicle transaction prices. TrueCar estimated the average price of a new vehicle in March rose to $32,201, up 2.1 percent from a year earlier.GM shares dipped 2 percent to close at $36.74, and Ford shares slipped 1.4 percent to $15.91.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS has launched a contingency plan to prepare for further appreciation in the local currency, which pushed January-March profit to the lowest in five quarters.Hyundai, the world's fifth-biggest automaker when combined with affiliate Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS, has seen overseas earnings shrink when converted into a won hovering near a six-year high against the U.S. dollar.Price competitiveness has also suffered, as a firmer won makes Korea-made exports more expensive for overseas buyers. The revenue impact of a 1.5 percent first-quarter rise in the won was exacerbated by buying incentives in the United States.Net profit was 1.93 trillion won ($1.86 billion) in January-March, marginally less than a year prior when Hyundai set aside cash to cover a product recall. The result was also lower than the 2.19 trillion won estimate of 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“A contingency plan is under way to prepare for further won strength, which we expect to persist in the second quarter,�� said Chief Financial Officer Lee Won-hee in a conference call after Hyundai released earnings on Thursday.The contingency plan includes cutting vehicle development costs, Lee said, without elaborating.Shares of Hyundai closed down 1.2 percent after the results, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in the wider market .KS11.“Management tried to give a positive signal to investors, but Hyundai faces a bumpy road ahead. No one can predict how the currency will move, and competition is getting tougher,�� said E*Trade Korea auto analyst Kang Sang-min.“It also remains to be seen how well new models will be received by U.S. customers,�� Kang said.Hyundai has had a turbulent time in the United States where a product recall last year was followed by lackluster sales and a management shake-up. The automaker has also had fewer new models in its product line-up in recent years compared with rivals.Ahead of new model launches, Hyundai increased buying incentives to clear its inventory, Lee said, which contributed to a 3 percent decline in first-quarter U.S. sales.“We expect the U.S. launches of the new Genesis (in April) and Sonata (in June) to help improve our sales and operating margin from the second quarter,�� he said.In China, the world’s biggest auto market, Hyundai has been expanding sales and this month tasked its new local chief with expediting the construction of a fourth factory.Adding capacity at its third Chinese plant helped raise sales in the country by 9 percent in the first quarter, though that was slower than the growth rates of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and the U.S.'s Ford Motor Co F.N.At home in Korea, sales climbed 5 percent with the help of the luxury, higher-margin Genesis - revamped late in 2013 - as well as a recovery in production following a labor dispute a year earlier.Hyundai will begin annual wage talks as early as May with the labor union in Korea, where the automaker builds nearly 40 percent of the vehicles it sells globally.Domestic sales could get a lift in the second quarter from the introduction late last month of a Sonata redesigned for the first time in five years.Hyundai's bread-and-butter model, however, is pitted against imports such as Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE Passat and Toyota's Camry which are benefiting from free-trade deals.($1 = 1037.6000 Korean Won)	3.399380223
(Reuters) - Auto sales in Canada slipped 2.2 percent in January, data showed on Friday, on weaker demand for European vehicles and strong comparable data from a year ago when Japan’s automakers were rebounding from earthquake and tsunami disruptions.While Canadian demand for vehicles made by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Audi VOWG_p.DE fell sharply last month, appetite for vehicles assembled by Detroit's Big Three automakers rose as buyers snapped up their more fuel-efficient passenger cars.“The Detroit Three enjoyed a great month, growing their combined market share from 45.6 percent to 49.2 percent,�� independent industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers said.He cautioned, however, that maintaining that share, which foreign automakers have been eating into for the past few years, “will be a challenge.”Overall, the industry sold 95,306 vehicles in January, down from 97,497 in January 2012 when sales jumped more than 15 percent amid recovering production at Japanese automakers following the devastating earthquake- and tsunami-caused major supply disruptions.Despite last month’s dip, DesRosiers said it looked as if the year “is off to a solid start.”After a strong 2012, Canadian vehicle sales are expected to continue to increase this year, nearing - or even exceeding - the record of 1.7 million set in full-year 2002 on the back of pent-up demand left over from the recession and higher employment especially in Western Canada, analysts have said.Chrysler Canada was No. 1 in sales in January, ousting Ford of Canada, as the unit of Fiat SpA's Chrysler LLC FIA.MI increased sales by 2.6 percent to 17,013. This was Chrysler's best January performance since 1996.Chrysler’s sales of cars rose 1.5 percent to 2,566 while its truck sales increased 2.8 percent to 14,447.Ford of Canada, a unit of Ford Motor Co F.N, came in at No. 2 with an 8.1 percent jump in sales to 16,197, its best January performance in 10 years.Car sales at Ford, which includes the Ford Fusion and Ford Focus models, increased 24 percent to 3,634 while truck sales rose 4.3 percent to 12,563.“With forecasts showing that 2013 could be a record sales year, we see lot of opportunity for sales growth for Ford,�� said Ford of Canada President and Chief Executive Dianne Craig.General Motors of Canada, a subsidiary of General Motors Inc GM.N, came in at third place with sales up 6.2 percent in January to 13,761, the company said, led by a 40 percent surge in compact car sales. This is a marked turnaround from a nearly 7 percent fall in sales in 2012 at the company, which sells Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands.“We are looking forward to further momentum in 2013 driven by our aggressive launch cadence, where approximately 70 percent of our vehicles will be all-new or significantly refreshed,�� said Marc Comeau, GM of Canada’s vice president of sales, service and marketing.Toyota Canada said it sold 9,438 vehicles last month, down 11.5 percent, partly because of a shortage of RAV4 inventory in advance of the launch this month of an all-new 2013 RAV4 model.Honda Motor Corp’s sales were down 26.5 percent to 6,211. And Audi’s fell 26.2 percent to 1,107.In the United States, several major automakers, including GM and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, posted better-than-expected U.S. vehicle sales for January, kicking off the fourth straight year of the sector's recovery from the depths of recession.	4.712255954

TOKYO, June 19 (Reuters) - The Japanese government is planning to offer ample support to popularize fuel cell vehicle technology as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co prepare to launch hydrogen-powered cars in 2015.The government on Thursday drafted a timeline that spelled out targets and actions over the next 25 years to commercialize fuel cell vehicles and boost use of hydrogen energy in general.The move comes as Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party considers supporting the technology through subsidies and tax breaks, so that by 2025 fuel cell vehicles can sell for around $20,000 or a little more, the same price as popular gas-electric hybrids.A fuel cell vehicle, which runs on electricity generated from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen, emits only water vapour and heat. The vehicles can run five times longer than battery-operated electric cars, and their hydrogen tanks can be filled in just a few minutes.But they are expensive, and the lack of fuelling infrastructure could get in the way of a successful commercialisation. In Japan, just a handful of hydrogen fuelling stations have been built due to strict safety regulations, high costs and the unclear outlook for demand.The government aims to cut the price for building a hydrogen fuel station by half to around 200 million to 250 million yen ($2 million-$2.45 million) by 2020, the draft showed.Japan also aims to have around 100 hydrogen stations in operation by end-March 2016, up from 17 now, the draft said.The timeline, which will be finalised in about a week, does not include fuel cell vehicle sales targets or details on how much in incentives will be offered to car buyers.Separately, the ruling party, which is also compiling policy recommendations to boost hydrogen energy use, is considering annual sales targets of 40,000 fuel cell cars by 2020 and 400,000 by 2030, a draft showed.Toyota, which plans to start selling its new fuel cell car next year in Japan, the United States and Europe, aims to popularize the technology as it did the Prius, which it launched in 1997 to become the world’s top-selling hybrid vehicle.The company, which is set to brief reporters on June 25 about its fuel cell vehicle development, has said the car could be priced as low as around $50,000 excluding subsidies. The Prius hybrid starts from around $21,600 in Japan before tax breaks. ($1 = 102.0500 Japanese Yen) (editing by Jane Baird)	0.3721874471
TOKYO, June 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp President Akio Toyoda earned 352 million yen ($2.84 million) in total compensation last year after his bonus doubled to about $2 million, the Japanese company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.Toyoda, head of the world’s best-selling automaker, received a bonus of 249 million yen in the year ended March, up from 127 million yen in the previous year. His base salary was unchanged.Toyoda’s compensation is roughly a third of what Nissan Motor Co paid Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn in the same period. Ghosn told shareholders on Tuesday he splits his time equally between Nissan and French alliance partner Renault SA , which he also heads.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV CEO Sergio Marchionne was the top-paid automotive executive in 2014, making about 31.3 million euros ($35 million).Toyota in May reported a 19 percent rise in net profit to 2.17 trillion yen for the business year through March, and forecast a third consecutive year of record profit.Nissan’s net profit grew 18 percent to 457.6 billion yen.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Sales of big, brawny pickup trucks fueled strong demand for new vehicles in the United States in June, driving the industry toward its strongest month since before the recession that drove General Motors Co and Chrysler into bankruptcy.GM and Ford Motor Co posted stronger-than-expected sales, and Chrysler Group’s sales met analysts�� expectations as the improving U.S. housing market led to surging demand for full-size pickups at all the U.S. automakers. Toyota Motor Corp also reported surprisingly strong U.S. sales.“America’s families are better off than they were at the beginning of the year and they believe - with good justification - that the economic expansion is going to continue,�� GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a statement.Overall U.S. auto industry sales in June are expected to show a rise of up to 8 percent compared with a year earlier and could reach their strongest monthly pace since the recession pushed Chrysler and GM to seek bankruptcy protection in 2009.Economists polled by Thomson Reuters expect an annual sales rate in June of 15.4 million vehicles. Several analysts and research firms that follow the auto industry expect a rate of 15.5 million to 15.7 million.Chrysler, majority-owned by Italy’s Fiat SpA, falls in the optimists�� camp as it expects a sales pace in the month of about 16 million vehicles, including medium and heavy trucks. On that basis, Ford expects the industry to finish in the range of just over 16 million vehicles.Medium and heavy trucks typically account for about 300,000 sales annually.“The fundamentals for continued industry gains in new-vehicle sales remain intact,�� Chrysler U.S. sales chief, Reid Bigland, said in a statement.GM expects a rate of 15.8 million, which would be the highest rate since November 2007. Volkswagen AG executives anticipate something in the mid-15 million range.Monthly sales are seen as an early indicator of the U.S. economy’s health. The auto industry has held up better than the broader economy as easier credit availability and pent-up demand for vehicles have driven demand.In May, U.S. auto sales rose more than expected as construction workers and oil drillers bought more pickups to meet growing demand for their services, a trend major automakers expect to continue through the rest of the year.GM’s sales came in far higher than expected, rising 6.5 percent to 264,843 cars and trucks, or their highest level for June since 2008. Analysts had expected growth closer to 2 percent.Sales of the No. 1 U.S. automaker’s two top-selling vehicles, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Cruze small car, rose 29 percent and 73 percent, respectively. Sales of the GMC Sierra pickup were up a third.Ford’s sales also came in stronger than expected with an increase of 13.4 percent to 235,643 vehicles, above the 11 percent gain Wall Street had expected. It was the best June result for Ford since 2006. The company’s F-150 pickup saw sales jump 24 percent.Chrysler’s sales rose 8 percent to 156,686 vehicles on strong demand for its two best-selling vehicles, the Ram full-size pickup (up 24 percent) and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV (up 33 percent). It was the best June total for the automaker since 2007.Toyota’s sales rose a far stronger than expected 10 percent to 195,235 vehicles. Nissan’s June U.S. sales also came in stronger than expected, rising 13 percent to 104,124 vehicles.GM shares were up 1.7 percent at $34.59 on Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. Ford shares were up 2 percent at $16.06.	7.87825249
Nov 20 (Reuters) - The 2013 Dodge Dart is “underpowered,�� according to testers for Consumer Reports magazine, which also said it was “underwhelmed�� by the performance of two American luxury cars, General Motors Co’s 2013 Cadillac XTS and Ford Motor Co’s 2013 Lincoln MKS.The magazine, which annually tests and rates hundreds of new and used cars and trucks, said it recommended a fourth model, Toyota Motor Corp’s redesigned Lexus ES sedan, although testers said the 2013 model “took a step back in ride and interior refinement from the previous ES.”The 2013 Dart sedan, which competes with such cars as the Toyota Corolla and the Ford Focus, is the first jointly developed model from Fiat SpA and its U.S. affiliate Chrysler.Consumer Reports lauded the Dart’s “solid feel, handling and ride,�� but said the compact sedan “can’t yet measure up to the best in class.”The magazine ranked the Cadillac higher than the Lincoln, but said neither car scored well enough to earn its recommendation.It singled out Cadillac’s new CUE infotainment system as “convoluted and frustrating,�� while faulting the Lincoln’s “cramped driving position, ungainly handling, uncomposed ride, and limited visibility.”The reviews will be in the magazine’s January issue.	7.509179202
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp announced on Monday a self-driving electric concept vehicle that it will tailor for companies to use for tasks like ride hailing and package delivery, underscoring how automakers are no longer simply building cars but also providing services to go with them.The world’s second-biggest carmaker said it plans to begin testing the e‐Palette concept vehicle in various regions, including the United States, in the early 2020s. It will come in three sizes: a bus-sized vehicle, a shuttle and a small delivery vehicle sized to run on sidewalks.Toyota said at the CES global technology conference in Las Vegas that it will work with companies including Amazon.com Inc, Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co, Pizza Hut, Mazda Motor Corp and Uber Technologies Inc[UBER.UL] to build the vehicle and its hardware and software support and develop connected mobility products.After intense research and development in self-driving technology, automakers are beginning to unveil clearly defined autonomous vehicle strategies and looking to apply the technology to uses like ride services, shuttle services and package deliveries.Toyota took longer than rivals to warm to the idea of autonomous vehicles, but has committed $1 billion through 2020 to develop advanced automated driving and artificial intelligence technology. It plans to begin testing cars that can drive themselves on highways around 2020.“This announcement marks a major step forward in our evolution towards sustainable mobility, demonstrating our continued expansion beyond traditional cars and trucks to the creation of new values including services for customers,�� said Toyota President Akio Toyoda in a statement.The vehicle features an open control interface enabling Toyota’s partner companies to install their own automated driving system. Toyota’s so-called “guardian�� technology will then act as a safety net, the company said.Carmakers, tech companies and other service providers have partnered on self-driving projects over past two years, due to the difficulty and high cost of developing such technology alone.	0.5309602154
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine conglomerate GT Capital Holdings Inc GTCAP.PS said on Thursday it would buy shares of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T worth up to 22.2 billion yen ($201.6 million), marking its first offshore investment.Toyota and GT Capital are co-owners of Toyota Philippines, the country’s top automotive manufacturer and retailer, with 49 percent and 51 percent, respectively.The share purchase will be debt-funded and executed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, based on the current prevailing rates on the dates of execution, GT Capital said in a statement.Toyota is attractive given the dividend payout and potential increase in its stock price, GT Capital President Carmelo Maria Luza Bautista told Reuters. “At current price levels, Toyota is a good investment.”GT Capital will acquire less than 0.1 percent of Toyota, which is valued at $208.7 billion.Philippine companies having dominant market positions are increasingly exploring overseas opportunities for fresh sources of revenue.Toyota Philippines is among the top income contributors of GT Capital, which is valued at $3.2 billion.GT Capital's shares rose 1.98 percent, bucking the broader stock market's .PSI 1.29 percent decline as of 0343 GMT.	4.562708188
(This August 1 story has been corrected to remove erroneous information in 17th paragraph)TOKYO (Reuters) - Misaki Harada wants to quit her job as a receptionist at a restaurant management company in Tokyo and move into marketing for an apparel maker.But the 24-year-old said she wanted more than just a bigger paycheck. Her next employer would need to improve her quality of life.“If you ask me whether I prefer more money or more flexible working hours, I would choose more flexible working hours,�� she said. “I want to get married soon and start a family. I want to make sure I have time to take care of my children.”As Japan’s population dwindles, its companies are being forced to change how they attract job seekers like Harada from an ever-shrinking labor pool.Nationwide, there are 1.62 jobs available for every job seeker, the strongest demand for labor in more than 44 years. The jobless rate is 2.4 percent, near a 25-year low, and real wages adjusted for inflation have fallen in five of the past six years.Flexible working hours, personal benefits like day care and even rent assistance are now on the table alongside salary.Such perks, common in the United States and Europe, are only just catching on in Japan, which until recently relied on a culture of complete devotion to an employer in exchange for job security and steady pay increases.Toyota, for instance, opened a 24-hour day care facility in April for shift workers at its plants near its headquarters in Toyota City.“Japanese companies are becoming more flexible about when and where you work,�� said Toshiaki Matsumoto, chief executive of HR Strategy, a human resources consultancy.Some companies, like Jtekt Corp 6473.T, the world's biggest supplier of vehicle steering systems, are simply moving some of their operations away from competition.Jtekt last year cut the ribbon on a new technology development center in Akita Prefecture, northern Japan, known more for its rice, sake and namesake dog breed than engineering. The facility, which will develop technology for self-driving cars, is far from other companies hiring into the industry.So far the company, a key supplier of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, has hired about 20 engineers and plans to roughly double its workforce by the end of the year.“In larger cities, it’s difficult to get across the message that we are hiring because we’re competing with many companies for the same talent,�� said Fukami Imai, the center’s representative director.Denso Corp 6902.T, another Toyota supplier, took the opposite route, moving part of its self-driving research program to Tokyo because it is a more attractive locale than its headquarters in gritty Nagoya.“Some companies are offering free food or subsidizing rent so workers can shorten commuting time,�� Matsumoto said. “Some companies even provide counseling and time off for couples trying to conceive.”Japan’s working-age population peaked in 1995 at 87 million and is forecast to fall to 45 million by 2065. Businesses slow to respond to that demographic change have been hit hard.Toyobo Co Ltd 3101.T said it needs to ramp up production of film used in flat-panel displays, but can't fully staff the production line.Keeping employees from quitting - and not just throwing money at the problem - is another crucial piece of the labor puzzle, experts say.“My new employer paid me more money, but the working hours were awful,�� said Daisuke Okamoto, 42, an accountant who left a job in advertising in April for a position at a consumer goods company. “At first, I had a lot of regret. Now the company has given me more flexible working hours and the freedom to occasionally work from home, so I feel better about the job.”Daikisangyo, which assembles plane fuselages and wings for Boeing Co BA.N, was having trouble retaining new employees. Then it introduced a mentoring program that reduced turnover to zero, at least for now.“It’s not just about the money anymore,�� said Tsuyoshi Saso, a manager at Interworks, a nationwide recruitment site for jobs in manufacturing. “They also want to work in a positive work environment with good colleagues.”Foreign workers can help fill some of the gaps, although they make up only about 2 percent of the current labor force, and companies hiring for “unskilled�� positions like farm work must rely on trainees under an internship program that lasts up to five years.The government has said it will create new categories for foreign workers with more limited skills, but will issue only a small number of such visas.Mazda Motor Corp's 7261.T suppliers, which typically operate independently, are cooperating to figure out the best way to use artificial intelligence and robots to remove human workers from the equation altogether.“Our goal is to create unmanned production lines that can operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,�� said Masato Uno, chairman of the Hiroshima Manufacturing Engineering Association, a consortium of Mazda suppliers and IT companies. “We expect this to address problems with productivity and labor shortages.��	-6.898130485

May 22 (Reuters) - Organizers said Friday they were cancelling the 2020 New York auto show that had previously been pushed back until August, citing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the venue’s use as a field hospital.The show, which was initially set for early April and is typically used to unveil many new vehicles, was previously postponed until August. The Javits Convention Center remains set-up as an active hospital and is in standby mode for the foreseeable future, organizers said.The next New York show will take place April 2-11, 2021. A string of auto shows have been canceled this year and some automakers -- like Toyota Motor Corp -- are opting to hold virtual unveilings of new vehicles.	3.239062122
* Follows precautionary recall by Toyota last week for same issue* Honda to recall estimated 400,000 cars globally* Nissan to recall estimated 152,000 cars globally* Honda says more reserves needed to pay for recalls* Mitsubishi Motors recalls 304 Lancer sedans in Japan (Recasts with Nissan, Mitsubishi recalls, more details)By Chang-Ran Kim and Mari SaitoTOKYO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Three Japanese automakers will recall more than half a million cars globally to replace air bag inflators made by Takata Corp, bringing the total tally of Takata-related recalls across all brands to around 20 million since 2008.The recalls announced on Thursday by Honda Motor, Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors correspond with a similar, precautionary recall by Toyota Motor last week after a recent “unusual deployment�� of a passenger-side air bag at a scrap yard in Japan.Honda, Takata’s biggest customer, said it would recall an estimated 400,000 vehicles globally, including about 177,000 in Japan across 11 models such as the Stream minivan, Fit subcompact and Civic hybrid produced in 2003.The rest include about 100,000 in Europe and 70,000 in Asia-Pacific, and none in the United States, Honda said.A spokeswoman said Honda would need to set aside more reserves to pay for the latest recalls, as well as the voluntary expansion to the rest of the world of a region-specific recall that had been limited to certain hot and humid areas in the United States.She said she could not disclose a specific figure.Honda has now recalled about 13.4 million vehicles globally for Takata air bag inflators since 2008 - about half of those to investigate what could be the root cause of the defects. U.S. regulators last month ordered Takata to move forward with a nationwide expansion of the regional recall, but Takata has refused, effectively putting the onus for voluntary recalls on the car makers.Honda said that if the cause is identified and Takata is at fault, it would negotiate a return of some or all of the recall costs from Takata.The recalls were triggered by an unusual explosion of a Takata air bag inflator in a 2003-model Toyota Will Cypha at a scrapyard in central Japan last month. Toyota recalled 185,000 vehicles from 2003 that were equipped with the same type of inflator, made at Takata’s Monclova factory in Mexico.Nissan estimated its global recall would cover 152,000 cars, including 82,000 in Japan, 49,000 in Europe and 6,000 in China for 2003 and 2004 model-year vehicles. Mitsubishi will recall 304 Lancer sedans in Japan only.A total of about 3.05 million vehicles have now been recalled in Japan by a dozen automakers.Nissan separately recalled 250,000 Note, March and Latio cars in Japan to fix faulty side-view mirrors.

TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japanese shares inched up on Tuesday as a weaker yen propped up exporters, although negative factors including the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit concerns curbed market gains.At 0153 GMT, Japan’s Nikkei share average was up 0.18% at 20,657.81.There were 157 advancers on the Nikkei index against 62 decliners.Adding to investor caution already heightened by the Washington-Beijing trade conflict was the prospect of more Brexit-related market turmoil.British lawmakers decide later on Tuesday whether to move Britain a step closer to an early election, when they vote on the first stage of their plan to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit.With the yen edging further away from an eight-month high against the dollar last week, shares of major exporters advanced.Toyota Motor Corp climbed 0.8%, Subaru was up 1.7%, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rose 0.5% and Panasonic added 0.7%.Nickel-related companies gained as the price of the metal soared to a five-year high due to shortage worries as top producer Indonesia said it would stop ore exports from January 2020, two years earlier than initially flagged.Sumitomo Metal Mining Co rallied 2.8% and Pacific Metals Co climbed 1.9%.The broader Topix gained 0.44% to 1,511.82.The stocks that gained the most among the top 30 core Topix names were Shin-Etsu Chemical Co, which rose 1.7%, and Hitachi, up 1.6%.The worst performers among the Topix 30 were Fanuc Corp , which lost 1.3%, followed by KDDI Corp, down 0.7%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is closing in on a record profit set before the Lehman crisis after topping up its annual net profit forecast by nearly $2 billion and outperforming Japanese rivals as its expansion plans bear fruit.The world's best-selling carmaker is racking up strong sales in a healthy U.S. market while keeping costs in check and taking a breather from building new facilities, in contrast to Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T which are grappling with heavy expansion costs.Toyota, one of the most export-reliant Japanese carmakers, is also reaping the benefits of a weakening yen that has boosted its profit margins but acknowledged it will have to start spending more to maintain its advantage.“Our basic stance of controlling fixed costs and improving gross profit will not change, but we do need aggressive investment in order to brush up on future technology,�� Managing Officer Takuo Sasaki told an earnings briefing on Wednesday.Toyota credited its conservative strategy as a key factor when it raised its net profit forecast by 190 billion yen to 1.67 trillion yen ($16.95 billion) for the year ending in March 2014, just short of its record 1.72 trillion yen from six years ago.A Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 23 analysts gave an average forecast of 1.79 trillion yen. Toyota’s annual operating profit rises by 40 billion yen for every one-yen rise in the value of the dollar.Toyota, which went through a rapid expansion before booking huge losses in the year ended March 2009, now appears to be in the sweet spot of industry and currency market trends, and is reaping the rewards of its own investments in production.But some analysts warned against complacency.“There are clearly risks of Toyota starting to lag in growth pace to its peers,�� said Takaki Nakanishi, an auto industry analyst and CEO of Nakanishi Research Institute in Tokyo.“If the decisions (on future expansion) are too slow, that may cause slower growth and that could make Toyota’s earnings grow slower than its competitors.”Market participants also worried that the company might be too stingy with its cash.“Toyota is representative of Japanese companies and even though it is generating so much profit its dividend yield of 2 percent is not enough,�� said BNP Paribas Securities chief Japan equity strategist Shun Maruyama.For the July-September quarter, Toyota said net profit rose 70 percent to 438.4 billion yen, in line with the average estimate of 441.01 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of six analysts and outpacing Japan's second-biggest carmaker Nissan and No.3 Honda Motor Co 7267.T.Last week, Nissan posted a meager 2 percent quarterly net profit growth while Honda booked a 46 percent rise.Nissan is aiming to raise its global market share to 8 percent from last year’s 6.2 percent and has been scrambling to build capacity worldwide. It is constructing eight new plants and expanding a factory in Russia.Nissan plans capital expenditure equal to about 5 percent of revenue this financial year, compared with Toyota’s 4 percent. On Wednesday, Toyota slightly raised its annual capital expenditure outlook by 2 percent to 940 billion yen.To ease the burden of its expansion, Nissan and its partner Renault SA RENA.PA unveiled a potentially wide-ranging operating alliance this week with Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T.Nissan’s quick but messy expansion has left it underperforming Toyota in the United States after running into product launch troubles and quality issues.In July-September, Toyota’s U.S. sales grew 12.2 percent year-on-year compared to Nissan’s 9.6 percent rise. Industry-wide sales grew about 9 percent year-on-year during that period.Toyota on Wednesday nudged up its North America sales forecast to 2.63 million vehicles from 2.61 million, helping to offset a drop in its Asia sales forecast to 1.64 million from 1.7 million.Toyota's shares ended 0.5 percent higher, compared with a 0.8 percent rise for Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei average .N225.For the year to date, Toyota’s shares are up nearly 60 percent, outpacing a 9 percent rise for Nissan, which was hit hard this week after cutting its full-year profit forecast on Friday, and Honda’s 25 percent rise.Toyota sold the most cars among automakers worldwide in January-September, beating General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.($1 = 98.5450 Japanese yen)	-2.771601017
(The following statement was released by the rating agency)Feb 19 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based PT Toyota Astra Financial Services�� (TAFS) National Long-Term Rating at ‘AAA(idn)�� with Stable Outlook. At the same time the agency has assigned TAFS a National Short-Term Rating of ‘F1+(idn)��.Fitch has also assigned TAFS’s proposed unsecured senior bond III of up to IDR1.5trn with a maturity of up to four years a National Long-Term Rating of ‘AAA(idn)�� and a National Short Term Rating of ‘F1+(idn)��. Proceeds from the issue will be used to support business growth.Its IDR1.3trn senior bond II issued in 2012 has been affirmed at National Long-Term ‘AAA(idn)��.Rating Action RationaleTAFS’s ratings reflect strong support from Toyota Financial Services Corporation (TFSC), one of its two major shareholders. TFSC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC; ‘A��/Stable), one of the biggest automotive manufacturers in the world. As part of the Toyota group, TAFS benefits from product knowledge-sharing and funding support. The latter is derived from TMC’s strong relationship with Japanese banks and Japanese government-backed financial institutions.TAFS also benefits from support from Astra International (AI), the other major shareholder, particularly in dealership networks. AI is a leading car distributor in Indonesia and holds exclusive rights for Toyota sales in the country.The new bonds are rated at the same level as TAFS’s National ‘AAA(idn)�� Long-Term rating to reflect Fitch’s view that they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company.Rating Drivers and SensitivitiesAny decline in TMC’s ownership would exert downward pressure on its ratings as would diminished support from both shareholders. However, Fitch sees this prospect as remote in the foreseeable future, given TAFS’s strategic role in TMC’s and AI’s Toyota car financing business. There is no upside potential for the National Rating, which is already at the peak of the scale.TAFS’s debt/equity ratio (DER) fell to 7.3x at end-September 2012 from 8x at end-2011, following capital injection of IDR150bn from its major shareholders in Q112 to support growth. TAFS’s receivables increased to IDR12.6trn at end-September 2012 (2011: IDR11trn) and its market share was stable at about 27% of Toyota car credit sales in 2012.In Fitch view, being a captive finance company that only focuses on new car financing, TAFS’s profitability is lower than that of peers that engage in new and used car financing. Return on asset (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) stood at about 2% and 21% respectively in Q312. However, Fitch expects TAFS’s profitability to improve in medium-term as the company will embark on used car financing as early as March 2013.TAFS’s asset quality remains manageable with non-performing loans remaining stable at 0.4% at end-September 2012. Fitch expects pressure on asset quality to mount in line with business growth, particularly outside Java. However, TAFS has a tight financing policy and has maintained adequate reserves in anticipation of a rise in non-performing loans.TAFS was established by TFSC to support Toyota car sales in Indonesia. It is equally owned by TFSC and AI.	1.364655425

* Base model price of new Fusion unchanged at $21,000* Ford CEO declines to detail succession, Europe plans* Mulally, other execs, tout hybrid Fusion’s 47 mpg* Fusion rivals Camry, Accord in fast-growing segmentBy Ernest Scheyder and Deepa SeetharamanNEW YORK/DETROIT, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co dispatched its top brass, including Chief Executive Alan Mulally, to major U.S. cities on Tuesday to promote the 2013 Fusion, its redesigned family sedan that takes aim at Toyota Motor Corp’s Camry.The second-largest U.S. automaker began shipping the Fusion, which boasts a more athletic design and more fuel economy options, to dealers last week. Ford hopes the third-generation Fusion, coupled with the new Escape crossover launched this spring, will boost its U.S. market share.The media blitz comes as Ford’s board of directors develops a succession plan for Mulally, 67. Ford is also cutting costs in Europe, where it expects to lose more than $1 billion this year. Ford’s sales in Europe fell 29 percent in August, while overall industry sales dropped 8.5 percent.“There is a tremendous decrease in demand, but we’re absolutely committed to Europe,�� Mulally said at a Fusion event in New York. “That will involve some restructuring.”The board is looking to name Mark Fields, Ford’s head of North and South America, chief operating officer, a sign that he could be the heir apparent to Mulally, a source told Reuters last week.But on Tuesday, Mulally kept a lid on the finer details of Ford’s plans for Europe and his own plans for retirement. He said Ford has a strong internal bench of potential leaders and he was “pleased to continue to serve as CEO of Ford.”�Please don’t vote me off,�� he joked to reporters.Under Mulally’s “One Ford�� plan, Ford is moving toward building more cars using fewer platforms, a move that cuts costs but allows Ford to offer more features at a lower price.The Fusion is the latest Ford car to receive a global overhaul, after the Fiesta subcompact and Focus compact car. The Fusion will be sold as the Mondeo in Europe and China. These models share about 75 percent of the same parts.The Fusion competes in the midsize sedan segment of the U.S. auto market, dominated by the Toyota Camry and Honda Motor Co’s Accord. Through August, sales in this bread-and-butter segment have risen 26 percent, while overall auto sales are up 15 percent, Ford said.“This is a transitional vehicle for our company,�� J Mays, Ford’s chief creative officer, said Monday night at an event in Miami Beach. He compared its impact to the 1955 Thunderbird, the 1962 Lincoln Continental or the 1964 Mustang.The base model of the revamped Fusion will cost $21,000, the same as the base price of the outgoing Fusion, Mays said.TOUTING ��47�� MPGFord is offering three gasoline-powered versions of the Fusion as well as a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. In a press release, Ford said the Fusion hybrid gets 47 miles per gallon on the highway and in the city, beating out the Camry hybrid.At the New York event with American Idol host Ryan Seacrest, Mulally held a sign touting the ��47�� figure. Ford also passed out T-shirts with the Fusion hybrid’s fuel economy figures.Boosting fuel efficiency has been a pillar of Ford’s vehicle strategy for the past six years. Ford is vying beat Toyota’s record on fuel economy with new electrified models this year.Ford must also meet federal government’s corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) target of 54.5 mpg by 2025. This translates to 36 mpg or higher in real world driving, analysts say.The average fuel economy of Ford’s cars and trucks for model year 2011 was 21.3 mpg, up from 18 mpg in 2006, U.S. government data shows. The industry average for 2011 was 22.8 mpg.To meet these ambitious standards, Ford is counting on turbocharged engines, start-stop systems, hybrid technology “and something we haven’t invented yet,�� said Raj Nair, Ford’s head of product development, at an event near Detroit.Ford plans to cut weight from future models by using lightweight materials. Ford is also designing and making key electric-drive components in-house to cut costs and accelerate development of these technologies.Buyers of the 1.6-liter Fusion with a turbocharged engine can purchase the $295 auto start-stop system, which shuts the engine off when the car is stopped at a light. Ford is looking to provide this option in a larger number of its vehicles.The Fusion also offers a lane-keeping system that alerts a driver if the car drifts into another lane.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T is considering diversifying its all-Japanese, all-male board by appointing a foreigner and could move as early as Monday, when it unveils its next slate of directors, sources close to the company said.“I think we have to think quite seriously, and we are thinking very, very seriously,�� Honda Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told Reuters when asked about naming a non-Japanese to the board. He was speaking on the sidelines of a plant opening in Celaya, Mexico, on Friday.Japan's third-biggest carmaker, long considered a pioneer of Japanese globalization with the likes of Sony Corp 6758.T, now lags far behind Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T in building diversity in its executive ranks.Japan’s big companies are under pressure to bring in outsiders to bolster governance, risk management and global perspective, having traditionally chosen board members from senior male managers who had spent their careers at the company.Honda started assembling cars in the United States in 1982 - a Japanese first - and now makes and sells about 80 percent of its vehicles overseas.It has nevertheless resisted bringing foreigners into the upper echelons of its Tokyo headquarters, sources close to the company said, believing its largely autonomous regional operations, that include locally hired managers, have made it global enough.That attitude now appears to be changing as it seeks faster growth and puts more emphasis on emerging markets.The automaker recently consulted a major Japanese bank about diversifying its management board, an individual with knowledge of the matter said.Sources close to Honda also said the company was considering appointing a foreigner to the board within the next several years and did not rule out that it could name one among board members and executives to be announced on Monday for the new financial year that starts in April. They added, however, that the company was in no hurry to diversify.The company declined to comment on executive changes.Honda has already appointed non-Japanese to senior posts at regional subsidiaries. At American Honda Motor, John Mendel, formerly with Ford Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp, is executive vice president overseeing sales, and Mike Accavitti, previously with Chrysler, is senior vice president of auto operations.Iwamura, their boss, serves as president and chief executive of American Honda.It was unclear whether Honda was looking at potential foreign board candidates from inside or outside the company.Honda’s relative lack of diversity at the top contrasts with Japan’s other big automakers.Nissan, along with French partner Renault SA RENA.PA, is run by French-Lebanese Carlos Ghosn, while 15 of its 58 directors and auditors are non-Japanese and one is a woman.Toyota, seen as a stalwart of traditional Japanese management, last year appointed American Mark Hogan, a former General Motors Co executive, to its board. Of its 68 directors and auditors, seven are foreign and one is a woman.Honda last year adopted an ambitious goal to expand global sales to 6 million cars annually by the year to March 2017, a 50 percent jump from last year’s total.Some executives see a need to work more closely across regions - including joint procurement of parts and materials - to boost efficiency, the sources said.Honda is also aiming to raise the share of emerging markets in total sales and to revamp its vehicle development process, involving engineers across regions from the earliest stages.	-7.08444521
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T took the wraps off a new sports car concept on Monday, underscoring an effort by Japan's largest automaker to energize its brand and fill a void in its lineup after discontinuing the Supra more than a decade ago.The concept, called the FT-1, is part of a broader attempt by Chief Executive Akio Toyoda to add excitement to a brand better known for quality and reliability than heart-pumping performance.Although the Supra never sold in high volumes it enjoyed a loyal following among compact sports car enthusiasts.	-2.770801942
JAKARTA/SINGAPORE, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Honda Motor’s Mobilio, a spacious yet affordable multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), has nearly doubled its market share this year, triggering a price war with Toyota Motor in Indonesia, the latest battleground for global carmakers.Toyota and its Daihatsu Motor affiliate have long enjoyed a more than 50 percent market share in Indonesia - where car ownership is less than 4 percent in a population of close to 250 million. This emerging market with a growing middle-class keen to upgrade to four wheels from two, is a key target for global carmakers facing slowing demand in the United States and Europe.For much of the past decade Toyota and Daihatsu were alone in offering the lower-range MPVs - dubbed ‘people movers�� locally - that are popular among family-oriented Indonesians. That market grip has seen off attempts by General Motors, Nissan Motor and others to dethrone them.But the Mobilio, a 7-seat MPV with a starting price of around $13,500, is now proving a serious challenger, with sales of about 67,000 since its January launch, driving the company’s Indonesian market share up to 13.6 percent. Toyota Group’s market share has dropped to 48.7 percent at end-September from above 54 percent five years ago, according to data from their distributor PT Astra International.Lower-range MPVs, including Toyota’s Avanza and the Daihatsu Xenia, make up over a third of industry sales in Indonesia, says Davy Tuilan, marketing director of PT Suzuki Indomobil Sales, a unit of Japanese rival Suzuki Motor.“The Indonesian market is now more open, because everybody is ready with a product line-up in low-cost green cars (LCGCs) and the low MPV segment,�� he said. LCGCs are a special category in Indonesia that qualify for some tax breaks.“LOOKS EXPENSIVE”Mobilio drivers say the compact MPV is priced competitively, has a sleek design and offers more room than its rivals.“It’s very different from other family cars. To us, it looks like an expensive car, while it’s very affordable,�� said Mirza Ayu, who lives with her parents and brother near the capital, Jakarta. The family bought a Mobilio in June to replace their 5-year-old Avanza.The Mobilio’s success also suggests Toyota may have become complacent in a market it has long dominated.“Others have come out with more updated products, new products and I think Toyota has been a little lazy in introducing new models,�� said Mohit Arora, vice president at research firm JD Power Asia Pacific, referring to MPVs.At a Honda dealership in Jakarta where the Mobilio accounts for around 60 percent of total sales, sales executive Agung Suriza said: “The Mobilio’s exterior is fresher than its Toyota and Daihatsu competitors. The design of the Xenia and Avanza hasn’t changed much for a long time.”A Toyota spokeswoman in Singapore said the group - Toyota, Daihatsu and Hino Motors - “sees increasing competition in Indonesia in a positive way, as a challenge to improve our products and services and to achieve higher standards in fulfilling our customers�� needs.”To protect its market position, Toyota said it would improve localisation - sourcing more in Indonesia - and strengthen its sales and service network. A Toyota engineer said the company was also working on giving the Avanza a facelift as early as next year, without elaborating.Automakers have responded to the competition with discounts.The Avanza is being discounted by up to 10 percent, or $1,250-$1,330, dealers said - around a 50 percent increase on last year’s discount and pushing its price into a lower bracket with the Xenia, which has seen sales drop by a third so far this year.“Last year’s discount was lower, but logically if there’s competition we take some steps,�� said one Toyota dealer.“No one’s buying Xenia,�� acknowledged a senior Daihatsu executive in Osaka. Daihatsu’s cheapest car in Indonesia starts at about $6,500. “If Suzuki began selling a car like the Alto in Indonesia, we’d be dead-meat,�� the executive added.Suzuki sells its Alto hatchback in India, one of its main markets, where the model is among its cheapest at a starting price of about $4,500.Koji Endo, Tokyo-based analyst with Advanced Research Japan, reckons Toyota and Daihatsu need to introduce a couple of models that are cheaper than those from Honda and others if they want to protect their market share.“I think it’s probably very difficult for Toyota-Daihatsu to keep 50 percent market share. Maybe 50 will decline to 45 or 40 in the next five years,�� predicted Endo. Indonesia contributed about 17 percent of Daihatsu’s global sales in the year to March.Honda did not respond to requests for comment, though Jonfis Fandy, marketing director at Honda Prospect Motors, attributed the Mobilio’s popularity to its exterior design, power-to-fuel ratio, roomy interior and safety features. “The Mobilio has been designed mostly to accommodate Indonesian customers�� needs,�� he said, adding Honda plans to expand the number of its dealers by 50 percent to more than 150 in the next couple of years.Competition in Indonesia is set to intensify as automakers build or expand capacity there. Mitsubishi Motors said last month it would invest $600 million in a plant to make MPVs.The industry association predicts car sales will rise 10 percent a year for five years from 2015, boosted in part by government promotion of LCGCs. Industry sales increased 2.7 percent from last year in January-September.	6.069338922
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Thursday it is recalling 466,000 minivans and cars globally, mostly in the United States, for possible faulty brakes and loss of a spare tire.The Japanese automaker said it is recalling about 16,000 Lexus GS sedans from model year 2013 because a switch in the braking system could cause the system to activate while driving, which could cause unexpected deceleration of the vehicle.Toyota said it was not aware of any accidents, injuries or fatalities related to the issue. Dealers will replace the brake pedal support assembly.Of the affected cars, about 10,500 were sold in the United States, 1,900 in Europe, 1,400 in China and 1,400 in other markets, a Toyota spokeswoman said.Toyota also is recalling about 450,000 Toyota Sienna minivans from model years 2004 to 2011 that were originally sold in cold weather states that use road salt to melt snow and ice. Some of the vehicles, from 2004 to 2010 model years, were involved in an April 2010 recall.The company said the affected vehicles have a spare tire carrier stowed under the vehicle with a lightweight, foam water splash protector that uses a cable to hold it in place. Road salt can corrode the cable, possibly resulting in the spare tire falling off.The spokeswoman said Toyota was not aware of any reports of accidents, injuries or fatalities related to this issue. Dealers will replace the carrier assembly as part of the recall.Of the affected minivans, about 370,000 were sold in the United States, 80,000 in Canada and 400 in western Europe, the spokeswoman said.	6.913535206
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is recalling about 160,000 Tacoma mid-size pickup trucks from the model years 2001 to 2004 in cold-weather U.S. states and in Canada because the spare tire could fall off.The spare tire in these Tacoma models is stored beneath the trucks�� bed. When the trucks were made, the metal plate that keeps the spare tire in place was not coated with sufficient amounts of phosphate to retard rust, Toyota said.Two accidents have been reported to Toyota involving vehicles following a Tacoma truck, but they did not result in injuries, a Toyota spokesman said.Over time and in limited cases, corrosion of the plate could cause it to break, causing the detachment of the spare tire, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. said in a statement on Wednesday.The recall covers 150,000 trucks originally sold in 20 cold-weather U.S. states and 10,000 trucks in Canada, Toyota said.Letters will go to the owners of the recalled vehicles in December, Toyota said.Toyota dealers will replace the spare tire assembly, if necessary, without charge to Tacoma owners.	6.50624927

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian technology start-up Cognitive Pilot, which makes components for driverless vehicles, is considering an initial public offering (IPO) after 2023, its chief executive told Reuters.The company has already attracted investment from top Russian lender Sberbank, which has bought a 30% stake, though it gave no indication on a valuation of the business.Cognitive Pilot develops components for self-driving cars as well as autonomous control systems for agricultural machinery, trains and trams. It lists state rail operator Russian Railways, farming conglomerate Rusagro and South Korean auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis among its clients.“The first IPOs in this sector will be highly successful. It’s important not to sleep through the moment,�� Chief Executive Olga Uskova said.“So if before we weren’t even thinking about an IPO, now we really are considering it.”After 2023 Cognitive Pilot will either launch an IPO or announce a new round of investment, Uskova added.With large tech companies and automakers developing and testing autonomous vehicles, including Russia’s Yandex and Google parent Alphabet, Cognitive Pilot is looking to increase capacity and mass-produce its technologies.However, it is likely to face strong competition from leading carmakers such as General Motors, Toyota and Tesla, which are working on developing in-house technology for autonomous vehicle systems.In the first half of this year Cognitive Pilot plans to open offices in China, the United States and Brazil, where it has several agricultural clients.Cognitive Pilot currently operates a plant in Tomsk, Siberia, where it produces radar technology used in self-driving systems.	-17.39162763

March 15 -Overview-- Toyota Motor has maintained an exceptionally strong financial position despite difficult business conditions and the strong yen.-- We expect the company to gradually improve its weak profitability because its operations have been returning to normal.-- We affirm the ‘AA-�� long-term and ‘A-1+�� short-term ratings on the company. The outlook remains negative.-- The negative outlook reflects the potential for overproduction in Japan to delay recovery in Toyota’s profitability.Rating ActionOn March 15, 2012, Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed its ‘AA-�� long-term and ‘A-1+�� short-term corporate credit ratings on Toyota Motor Corp. and related entities, including Toyota Motor Credit Corp. (AA-/Negative/A-1+), based on Toyota Motor’s exceptionally strong financial position and our view that a return to normal operations at the company is likely to produce a continuous improvement in profitability in the next two years. The outlook on the long-term corporate credit rating remains negative.RationaleWe continue to view Toyota Motor’s financial risk profile as minimal. Toyota Motor has substantial cash and marketable securities and remains virtually free of net debt in its nonfinancial services operations. Despite difficult business conditions and the strong yen, we expect measures of Toyota Motor’s credit quality to remain very strong over the next two years, with a ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt of significantly more than 100% and a ratio of debt to EBITDA of less than 1.0x on a fully adjusted basis.We expect Toyota Motor’s profitability to improve from its current weak level because its operations have been returning to normal. Sales rebounded strongly in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011 (ending March 31, 2012) as production and inventory recovered from severely damaged supply chains and production cuts following the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. Once inventory levels have returned to normal, which we expect to occur by the end of March 2012, the recovery in sales should further accelerate in fiscal 2012. In our opinion, Toyota Motor’s competitive position remains strong, and we expect the company to regain some of its lost market share in the U.S.We also believe Toyota Motor’s proven ability to consistently reduce costs should help it improve profitability. In recent years, Toyota Motor has consistently cut about JPY300 billion in costs annually. Moreover, Toyota Motor is taking extra measures to reduce exposure to changes in the value of the yen, increasing local content in vehicles produced overseas and increasing its imports of components for vehicles produced in Japan. In our base case scenario, we expect Toyota Motor’s nonfinancial services operations to achieve an operating margin of about 5% and an EBITDA margin of about 10% by fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, we see overproduction in Japan, with many vehicles destined for overseas markets, as a weakness that could prevent Toyota Motor from making the continuous improvements in profitability that we expect, in the event that the yen becomes even stronger.LiquidityExceptional liquidity underpins the ‘AA-�� long-term rating on Toyota Motor. We believe that the company’s sources of liquidity will easily exceed 2x uses over the next two years. As of Dec. 31, 2011, on a consolidated basis, Toyota Motor’s cash and cash equivalents totaled JPY1.8 trillion. Moreover, Toyota Motor holds large investments in highly rated government securities, such as Japanese government bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds, and it classifies these as both current assets and investments. We view these as high-quality financial assets that further support Toyota Motor’s exceptional liquidity. Toyota Motor’s total cash and securities significantly exceeded the JPY2.8 trillion in long-term debt that was due to mature within a year on a consolidated basis. We believe Toyota Motor maintains a massive net cash position in its nonfinancial services operations. In addition, the company had JPY8.07 trillion in long-term unused lines of credit as of March 31, 2011, and it maintains strong relationships with major Japanese banking groups. Toyota Motor’s captive finance operations have sizable short-term debts, but its short-term assets adequately match them.OutlookThe negative outlook reflects Standard &amp; Poor’s concern that Toyota Motor’s overproduction in Japan has the potential to delay a recovery in its earnings. Although we expect Toyota Motor to gradually reduce its exposure to the yen, becoming less vulnerable to a strong yen through the increase of local content in vehicles produced overseas and more imports of components for vehicles produced in Japan, large production capacity in Japan may slow the pace of recovery if the yen rises further.We may lower the ratings if we conclude that Toyota Motor’s nonfinancial services operations are unlikely to continue to demonstrate improvement and to achieve an operating margin of about 5% and an EBITDA margin of about 10% on a sustainable basis.At the same time, we may revise the outlook back to stable if we believe the company is likely to significantly accelerate the recovery in its profitability through effective measures to increase its resilience to the strong yen or rapid expansion of sales in major vehicle markets. However, the challenges the company faces, including intense competition and the strong yen, lead us to view an upward outlook revision as less likely in the next 12 months.	-4.871194379
(Adds more automakers, quotes from Rosekind; previous dateline WASHINGTON)RUCKERSVILLE, Va., Sept 11 (Reuters) - A group of major automakers accounting for more than half of U.S. auto sales will make automatic emergency braking standard on new U.S. vehicles in one of the industry’s biggest auto safety moves since it embraced technology to prevent rollovers more than a decade ago.The car makers, which accounted for 57 percent of car and light truck sales in the United States last year, said Friday they will work with regulators and the insurance industry to roll out collision avoiding braking technology across their lineups over the next few years.The automakers are Volkswagen and its luxury car division Audi, BMW, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Tesla Motors Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and Volvo AB.“We are entering a new era of vehicle safety, focused on preventing crashes from ever occurring,�� U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement Friday.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is overseeing the effort, said the collaborative agreement took shape over the last two weeks and that other car and truck manufacturers are still considering joining.Analysts say it could still take years for automakers to redesign the electrical and braking systems of their cars to install autonomous braking. Among the automotive technology suppliers that could benefit are Continental AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, Delphi Automotive Plc, Denso Corp and Autoliv Inc.The agreement echoes earlier voluntary moves by big automakers. In the late 1980s, Chrysler began installing airbags in all its vehicles. In the 2000s, GM, Ford and others agreed to make anti-rollover technology standard on most sport utility vehicles. Stability control is now mandatory on light vehicles.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), a non-profit group affiliated with the insurance industry, has pushed automakers to install automatic emergency braking by making it a requirement for earning top marks in its influential crash test rankings.Federal officials say automatic braking can help avoid rear-end collisions, which accounted for one-third of all police-reported car crashes in 2013. Studies, including a recent IIHS report, also show that AEB technology can reduce insurance injury claims by as much as 35 percent.NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind told reporters Friday that AEB should become standard among the automakers faster than the the seven to eight years it could take to develop mandatory regulations to deliver the technology to consumers.“It’s visible and the pressure’s on to make this happen fast,�� said Rosekind, who announced the agreement at an IIHS safety test facility 100 miles (160 km) from Washington in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. The NHTSA plans to make a series of new auto safety initiatives during the fall, he said.Only about 4 percent of cars built in North America will have automatic emergency braking, according to the business information firm IHS Inc. Toyota said earlier this year said that by the end of 2017 it would offer such systems in option packages for nearly all its models, with the technology packages ranging from $300 to about $500.

SEOUL, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is considering importing cars to South Korea from Europe, the head of its South Korean unit said on Tuesday, a possible move aimed at further cutting reliance on the neighboring Japan for shipments amid the yen’s strength.Toyota Korea is “studying�� the possibility of bringing in products from Europe, Tommy H. Nakabayashi, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Korea, told reporters, without elaborating.Toyota has a meager presence in South Korea, which is dominated by local rivals Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, but Nakabayashi said it aimed to boost local sales by 160 percent to 13,000 vehicles this year, and Lexus sales by 90 percent to 8,000 vehicles.Toyota on Tuesday launched three new Prius models in South Korea.The strong yen and South Korea’s bilateral trade deals with United States and Europe are making exports from Japan relatively less cost-competitive and prompting carmakers to consider alternative sources.Toyota has already started to sell U.S.-made Camry sedans and Sienna minivans in South Korea, and Honda Motor Co’s CEO said in November that the automaker was considering importing cars into South Korea from the United States instead of Japan.

(Adds comment from Toyota)BEIJING, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Sales in China by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. and its two local joint-venture partners fell 5 percent in July from a year earlier to about 78,400 vehicles, according to a company spokesman.The decline was the first for Toyota since January this year when its sales tumbled 26.2 percent because of China’s lunar new year holiday.The spokesman, Takanori Yokoi, said the sales slide in July was “caused by a technical reason.�� He said sales in July 2011 were “unusually high�� following three months of sluggish business in the wake of Japan’s devastating earthquake on March 11 that year.The earthquake and a tsunami it caused paralyzed production of key components in Japan and impacted Toyota’s vehicle production around the world, including China, depriving dealers of cars to sell.For the first seven months of this year, sales were still up from a year earlier for the Japanese auto maker.Its sales through July totaled about 520,800 vehicles, up 19.2-percent from the same period last year, according to Yokoi. That works out to an average of about 74,400 a month for the first seven months.Yokoi said the Japanese auto maker was still on track to meet its goal of selling a total of one million cars in China this year.Toyota’s China sales last year totaled about 883,400 vehicles, a 4.4 percent increase from 2010, reflecting in part the general slowdown of automobile sales in China last year.Toyota would have to grow sales by about 13 percent this year to meet its goal of selling one million vehicles.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank Corp and Toyota Motor will receive investment from a further five Japanese automakers, two sources familiar with the matter said, broadening backing for the all-Japan effort.Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp, Subaru Corp, Isuzu Motors and Toyota unit Daihatsu will each take a stake of a few percent in the venture, the sources said.With the move to autonomous driving and electric vehicles creating ructions across the industry and spawning once unlikely partnerships, the venture, Monet, which is developing an on-demand self-driving service platform, hopes to help Japan’s auto industry ride the shift.Monet, announced in October, added investment from Honda Motor Co and Toyota’s truck making subsidiary Hino Motors in March, leaving SoftBank Corp the largest shareholder with a 40.2% share and Toyota owning 39.8%.When Honda and Hino joined in March, the total investment in Monet was 2.5 billion yen ($23.20 million). It was not immediately clear how much the five new partners are investing in the venture.Monet declined to comment on the investment, which was first reported by Nikkei. Mazda, Suzuki, Subaru, Isuzu and Daihatsu also declined to comment.The venture’s head told Reuters earlier this month it was planning to expand its investor base. Monet hopes to export a basic version of the service to Southeast Asia in 2020 and aims to roll out on-demand bus and car services in Japan in the next year.($1 = 107.7500 yen)	6.517344546

* Case brought by family of woman killed in 2009 car crash* Case first to go to trial in California over acceleration issues* Woman’s vehicle not subject to Toyota’s acceleration-related recallsOct 10 (Reuters) - A jury in California on Thursday found Toyota Motor Corp not liable in one of the first wrongful death lawsuits to go to trial in the United States over alleged defects that caused some vehicles to unexpectedly accelerate.The closely watched case was brought by the husband and son of Noriko Uno, a 66-year old woman killed in a 2009 car crash involving a 2006 Toyota Camry.It is among hundreds of similar lawsuits facing Toyota over acceleration issues, which prompted the automaker to recall millions of vehicles since 2009.Uno’s vehicle was not subject to the acceleration-related recalls.According to their lawsuit, Uno’s Camry was struck by another vehicle, causing it to speed out of control down a busy California road until it hit a tree, killing Uno.Her family accused the automaker of failing to install brake-override systems that could have stopped out-of-control acceleration in vehicles sold in the U.S.The case is the first to go to trial in California over acceleration issues.“Regarding the verdict, we are gratified that the jury concluded the design of the 2006 Camry did not contribute to this unfortunate accident, affirming the same conclusion we reached after more than three years of careful investigation - that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle at issue in this case,�� a Toyota spokeswoman said in a statement.A lawyer for the family of Noriko Uno could not be immediately reached for comment.According to a recent regulatory filing from Toyota, around 200 proposed class actions and more than 500 individual cases have been filed against the company since February 2009 over the alleged acceleration issues.This week, a federal judge in California ruled that Toyota must face a trial over claims that it failed to warn the public about design defects that caused certain vehicles to accelerate unintentionally.That case was brought by the estate of Ida St. John, who said in 2009 that her 2005 Camry sped out of control and hit a school building. She died after giving that testimony, but the lawsuit does not claim that her death was caused by the crash.The trial, slated to begin Nov. 5, will be one of the first of the many federal lawsuits focusing on the Toyota acceleration issues.The first federal sudden-acceleration case to go to trial ended with a win for Toyota in 2011, in a lawsuit brought by a doctor who worked in Brooklyn.	-3.782757311

DETROIT, Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators are investigating reports of driver-side door fires in some 2006 and 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer sport utility vehicles.The preliminary investigation covers more than 309,000 vehicles, made by General Motors Co, according to a posting on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Regulators received 12 consumer complaints, as well as field reports, describing the melting or burning of the driver’s power window master switch in those Trailblazer vehicles.Ten of the complaints led to driver-side door fires, which sometimes occurred while the SUV was being driven.No injuries or accidents were reported, a GM spokesman said.The Trailblazer probe comes after another investigation of 830,000 Toyota Motor Co RAV4 crossover vehicles and Camry sedans for electrical fires, which appear to have originated from the power window master switch on the driver’s door.	6.675
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, the world's largest automaker, said it would buy out the rest of minivehicle unit Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T - an all-stock deal worth about $3 billion and part of its strategy to strengthen its push into compact cars for emerging markets.The companies intend to develop Daihatsu into a global brand as they focus on growing markets for compact cars, noting that entry-level car markets were expanding due to economic development and that vehicles were becoming smaller due to environmental and traffic concerns.Acquiring full control of Daihatsu, of which Toyota currently owns 51.2 percent, will allow it to better leverage the lower-cost brand and enable Daihatsu to more easily adopt next-generation technologies developed by Toyota.“We see this as the perfect opportunity to cement our relationship with Toyota, and, by doing so, to embark on a new period of growth, and to elevate the Daihatsu brand to a global standard,�� Daihatsu said in a statement.Toyota will acquire the remaining Daihatsu shares by swapping 0.26 of its own shares for each Daihatsu share. Daihatsu shares will be delisted after July 26.Daihatsu specialises in 660 cc vehicles and produces models including the Mira and the Cast, while also supplying car bodies and engines to Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T.It competes fiercely with Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T in Japan, where both automakers each hold about 30 percent of the minivehicle market. But as minivehicles sales slump at home due to a rapidly ageing society and a lack of interest in car ownership among young people, the automakers have been looking to expand further into overseas markets.Daihatsu has a 16.2 percent market share of the passenger car market in Indonesia, where it manufactures the Ayla and other vehicles in a joint venture with Astra International. In Malaysia, it operates a joint venture which has a market share of around 32.5 percent.It also exports to Europe and North America, where some of its models have been sold under Toyota’s Scion brand targeted at the youth market.Global sales for Daihatsu slid 13.3 percent in 2015, the weakest sales performance in the Toyota group last year, which also includes the Toyota and Lexus brands and truck maker Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T.The announcement comes days after Toyota denied a media report that it is discussing possible tie-ups with Suzuki from a variety of angles, including cross-share holdings.	-13.53820598
MILAN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - AS Roma said on Monday its holding company was in talks with a group led by U.S. billionaire Daniel Friedkin about a sale of the Serie A football club though no formal deal had yet been agreed.“Any deal with Group Friedkin is subject to the positive outcome of the legal due diligence process on the AS Roma group,�� the club said in a statement.The Financial Times reported on Monday a consortium led by Friedkin was set to buy AS Roma for 750 million euros ($840.30 million), including debt, a record valuation for a Serie A team.Shares in AS Roma, which is controlled by a group of American investors following a 2014 deal, shot up more than 9% at the open in Milan.Assets owned by the Friedkin Group range from one of the world’s largest independent Toyota distributors to a number of luxury resorts.	0.384232247
* Toyota says China sales fell 48.9 pct y/y in Sept* Nissan China sales, ex-imports, down 35 pct in Sept* Honda down 40.5 pct, Suzuki drops 42.5 pct* Market share could continue to fall - analyst (Adds Toyota, dealer comment)By Fang Yan and Yoko KubotaBEIJING/TOKYO, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Japanese car makers reported tumbling sales in China for September - with Toyota’s almost halving - confirming the impact of a territorial row between the two countries and raising concerns about their future in the world’s biggest auto market.Violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September after Japan nationalized two of the East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and the Senkaku in Japanese, by purchasing then from their private owners.Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday that sales in China fell 48.9 percent in September from a year earlier, while Honda Motor Co reported a 40.5 percent slide in its sales there.Nissan Motor Co’s China auto sales, including imports, fell 35.3 percent in September from a year earlier, according to its China venture partner Dongfeng Motor Group Co . Suzuki Motor Corp said shipments to dealerships in China fell 42.5 percent last month from a year earlier.“Inventories are growing, factories are operating less, and retail is not going well at all,�� said Koji Endo, a senior analyst at Advanced Research Japan.“It’ll be the German and South Korean makers that will take over share from the Japanese brands when Japanese cars sell less. I don’t see a single factor that is positive (for the Japanese brands).”While the street protests have eased, China has sent its patrol ships into what Japan considers its territorial waters near the islands in recent weeks, prompting Tokyo to lodge protests against Beijing.Analysts say that sales for Japanese car makers, which together had just over a fifth of the Chinese auto market before the protests, could continue to weaken as long as the diplomatic tension remains.“We had cut our 2012 sales forecast of Japanese cars by 100,000, but it seems to be way too conservative now,�� said John Zeng, Asia Pacific director for industry consultancy LMC Automotive. “We had previously expected them to sell 3.04 million, but it will be great if they could move 3 million.”Toyota and its two local Chinese partners sold a total of about 44,100 vehicles in September, the company’s Beijing-based spokesman Takanori Yokoi said.For the first nine months of this year, sales by Toyota and its partners totalled about 640,200 vehicles, up 4.6 percent from the year-ago period, Yokoi said.Smaller rival Mazda Motor Corp said last week that its China sales tumbled 35 percent in September from a year earlier.According to Toyota sales executives in Beijing and dealers selling Toyota and Lexus cars, sales began bouncing back towards the end of the month, giving hope for an early comeback.“The biggest question now is how permanent the damage Toyota and other Japanese brands sustained is,�� a key Toyota and Lexus dealer operator said. “It’s too early to say one way or the other, but we are a bit concerned.”A Japan-based Toyota executive has told Reuters that Toyota’s production cutbacks in China were likely to extend through November, which points to the company’s pessimism over prospects for an early recovery.At least two Beijing-based Toyota executives have told Reuters that the Japanese automaker and its Chinese partners were unlikely to be able to deliver their goal of selling 1 million cars in China this year. They sold less than 900,000 cars in 2011.Among the Japanese car makers, Nissan is the most exposed to the Chinese market, followed by Honda and Mazda.In 2011, Nissan sold 883,000 vehicles in the world’s biggest car market, which accounted for about 27 percent of the vehicles the firm sold globally. For Honda, that ratio was about 20 percent, while for Mazda, it was around 18 percent.For Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, China accounted for about 12 percent of the vehicles it sold globally in 2011.Market share of Japanese brands stood at 21.2 percent at the end of August, down from 21.6 percent in 2011, according to official data. German brands advanced to 23.3 percent from 21.3 percent, while market share of Korean brands rose to 9.3 percent from 9 percent during the period.The dramatic fall-off in demand for Japanese vehicles has been an unexpected boon for other foreign brands. In September, BMW’s China sales surged 55 percent, Audi by 20 percent and Hyundai Motor by 15 percent.The anonymous Toyota-Lexus dealer operator’s read from visiting his Toyota and Japanese-brand car outlets, mostly in southern China, is that 10 percent of his customers have now no intention to buy Toyota cars and cancelled their orders, while 20 percent are sticking to them. “The rest - about 70 percent - are on the fence.�� (Additional reporting by Kazunori Takada in SHANGHAI and Yoko Kubota in TOKYO; Writing by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Alex Richardson)	3.010780962

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is building a closed-course test facility in Michigan for its self-driving vehicle technology that will replicate “edge case�� driving scenarios that are too dangerous to conduct on public roads.The facility at Ottawa Lake, which is being built by the Toyota Research Institute, will go into operation in October.“This new site will give us the flexibility to customize driving scenarios that will push the limits of our technology and move us closer to conceiving a human-driven vehicle that is incapable of causing a crash,�� Ryan Eustice, the Toyota Research Institute’s senior vice president of automated driving, said in a statement.Automakers such as General Motors Co and companies such as Alphabet Inc unit Waymo have been racing to develop self-driving cars and be the first to market with a viable product.But questions about the safety of self-driving technology and oversight of developers were raised after a fatal collision between an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian in Arizona in March.Following that accident, Toyota suspended all its self-driving tests on U.S. public roads in California and Michigan. Toyota has continued tests on closed courses.A Toyota Research Institute spokesman said halting tests on public roads has allowed the automaker to refine and upgrade its fleet of test vehicles.“We will resume testing on public roads in a few weeks, once these three systems have been more closely aligned,�� the spokesman said.	2.254035943
SAN JOSE, July 22 (Reuters) - Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla signed a bill on Monday to slash taxes on hybrid cars by 20 percentage points, in a bid to cut fuel emissions in the Central American nation.The 2006 tax will be cut to 10 percent, well below the 30 to 53 percent tax rates levied on vehicles fueled exclusively by gasoline and diesel but still higher than the zero-tax status enjoyed by electric vehicles.“In this bill we’ve incorporated incentives that should be seen as signs that Costa Rica wants to keep moving forward in its determination of achieving its carbon neutrality goal��, Chinchilla told reporters.The tax break applies to sedan models, motorcycles and some pick up trucks that run on both gasoline and electricity.The only hybrid model sold in the Central American country is the Toyota Prius, but Nissan is looking to start selling its Leaf model soon, according to a spokeswoman for Costa Rica’s Environment Ministry.Costa Rica has set the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2021, which means that any industrial emissions will be offset through different mechanisms, like taxation, reforesting to soak up greenhouse gases, and using clean energy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Didi Mobility Japan, a joint venture (JV) by China’s Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Corp, said it would expand its taxi-hailing service to 13 cities across Japan.The app was first rolled out in September in Osaka, a popular destination for Chinese tourists, where it has tied up with 40 taxi firms in an increasingly crowded market for such apps that includes rivals backed by Sony Corp and Toyota Motor Corp.It is expanding into Tokyo and Kyoto from Wednesday, with a further 10 locations to follow in the current financial year.Despite SoftBank’s oversized presence in the global ride-hailing industry, such services are effectively banned in Japan, leaving SoftBank portfolio companies like Didi and Uber limited to offering services that match taxis with customers.Didi is among a growing number of SoftBank Group Corp-backed companies launching JVs with SoftBank’s domestic telco. Other startups doing so are shared co-working firm WeWork Cos and Indian hotel startup OYO.As part of SoftBank’s efforts to drive synergies between its portfolio companies users will be able to access the taxi-hailing service through Yahoo Japan’s route-finding app and pay via PayPay, an app that uses tech from India’s Paytm.	-3.523763021

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - BMW AG on Wednesday said its first fuel cell vehicle would likely be a larger-sized sedan which would put on the market after 2020, when a hydrogen development partnership ends between the German luxury automaker and Toyota Motor Corp.Under its partnership with Toyota, BMW is developing a way to compress hydrogen at ultra-low temperatures to increase its storage volume, using as a base a fuel cell stack developed by Japan’s largest automaker.BMW and Toyota have been cooperating on fuel cell technology since 2013, just before Toyota introduced its Mirai fuel cell model in late 2014.While the Mirai can travel around 700 kilometres on a single hydrogen fueling, the German automaker said it was developing a vehicle which would travel further, using compressed hydrogen, a process which would take a few more years to perfect.“It will be sometime after 2020,�� Merten Jung, head of fuel cell development at BMW, told Reuters in an interview at the Tokyo Motor Show.He added: “We don’t have a model yet, but ... as the character of our technology favours larger cars, our model will probably be something like a long distance car, a larger sedan.”Fuel cell vehicles run on electricity created by mixing hydrogen, the world’s most commonly available element, with oxygen, and emitting water in the process, rather than carbon emissions created by gasoline vehicles.This makes them viable “zero-emissions�� vehicles, but research is expensive due to costly components and the need to create fueling infrastructure, prompting many of the world’s largest automakers to strike up development partnerships.BMW’s hydrogen car will likely be bigger than Toyota’s mid-sized Mirai, and the five-seat Clarity Fuel Cell launched by Honda on Wednesday.Jung at BMW said it was unlikely that BMW and Toyota would produce a fuel cell car together, as the world’s biggest luxury car maker and the world’s best selling car maker largely targeted different markets.“As we have two different opinions as companies when it comes to products on the market, we probably won’t have the same car on the market,�� he said.“At a certain point there needs to be a difference between Toyota and BMW, and where things need to be separate, but until that point, anything is possible.�� (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)	1.467949763
(Reuters) - Renault SA’s carmaking alliance with Nissan Motor Co is partnering with Microsoft Corp to develop cloud-based services for cars, a step toward the group’s plans to build self-driving automobiles by 2020.The services, based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, will include advanced navigation, predictive maintenance and over-the-air software updates.Renault and Nissan plan to launch more than 10 vehicles with autonomous drive technology by 2020. In January, the alliance hired former Nokia executive Ogi Redzic to lead its connected car efforts.The alliance said last week it would buy French software development company Sylpheo to offer new services including ride hailing and car sharing.Automakers from Toyota Motor Corp to General Motors have been investing in software firms and tech start-ups to position themselves for the rise of autonomous driving, ride-sharing and other connected services which threaten the traditional vehicle ownership model that has dominated the past century.	-2.932724814
* Concerns on domestic virus epidemic weigh on Nikkei* Railways, airlines and amusement park operators fall* Internet firms gain, exporters benefit from softer yenTOKYO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Japanese shares ended lower on Friday as mounting coronavirus cases in China and other Asian countries eclipsed the boost from a weaker yen, with many investors closing their positions ahead of a long weekend.Investors also dumped shares that appeared vulnerable to further spread of the pathogen, such as transport services, and instead picked up stocks of internet services firms.The Nikkei share average dropped 0.39% to 23,386.74, while the broader Topix ticked down 0.03% to 1,674.00. On the week, the Nikkei was down 1.27% and the Topix fell 1.70%.That compared with a fall of 0.2% in U.S. S&amp;P500 and a 0.1% drop in FTSEurofirst, as of Thursday.“Japan stock ETFs have seen outflows of funds.

FRANKFURT, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Volkswagen will need to address some regional gaps as it seeks to become the world’s largest carmaker, head of personnel Horst Neumann told German daily Handelsblatt, citing weakness in vans and light trucks in emerging markets.“We must not believe that we’ve made it, that we’re rich and invincible now,�� Neumann was quoted as saying in an excerpt of an interview to be published on Monday and made available to Reuters on Sunday.“Only then can we address remaining weaknesses.

NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Mark Hogan, a former General Motors Co GM.N executive, says he often chided Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T for its weakness in fast-growing Brazil and Argentina despite having reached the No. 1 spot in the global industry.To address perceived weak spots including an insular management style, the Japanese corporate giant has in recent months brought an infusion of outsiders - including Hogan - to its inner circle and put a foreigner in full control of its operations in Latin America, as well as several other overseas markets.Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s president and grandson of the company’s founder, has set out to open up the ranks of top management after concluding that Toyota had become too big and global for its traditionally closed and centrally controlled management style.Toyota’s management structure came under fire for its response to deadly accidents in the United States and ensuing recalls of millions of vehicles at the end of the last decade, which centered around cases of unintended acceleration.Executives at the headquarters in Toyota city, near Nagoya in central Japan, did not communicate well with U.S. staff, and decisions, made mostly at headquarters, came too late.Hogan, 62, was one of three outside board members Toyota appointed in June - the first such appointments in its 76-year-history and only the second non-Japanese to serve on the board.Nicholas Benes, representative director of The Board Director Training Institute of Japan, said research shows that the most successful global companies employ more foreigners on their board or in senior positions as their overseas sales increase.Toyota has only one foreigner on its 16-person board, but makes 75 percent of its sales abroad.The Toyota group has more room to grow abroad - as Hogan’s chiding about Latin America suggests - and new markets will be key to achieving growth targets including a record 9.91 million vehicle sales globally in 2013.Brazil’s auto market has more than doubled since 2005 and is now the world’s fourth largest, but Toyota’s market share there has been stuck around 3 percent, compared with nearly 15 percent in the U.S. market.“One of the few weaknesses of Toyota in the past, it’s been rather methodical, slow decision making process that eventually ended up here in Japan at all decisions no matter how global they were,�� Hogan told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday in Nagoya.Hogan said that, in addition to providing an outsider’s objective perspective to board discussions, he has been asked by Toyoda to help the company expand in Latin America by advising the recently appointed foreign executive overseeing the region.Hogan, the only non-Japanese among the three new outside directors, had worked at a Toyota-GM joint venture in California during his time at GM.He is not the first non-Japanese to serve on Toyota’s board, however. Jim Press, a soft-spoken man from Kansas who spent 37 years at Toyota, left abruptly to work for Chrysler in September 2007 just months after joining the Toyota board.Toyota is late in the game in bringing in external directors among Japanese companies, which have typically been considered more insular than global manufacturers in the West.Of companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section, 54.2 percent had outside directors in 2012, up from 43.7 percent in 2008, according to a TSE study.But Toyota is still hardly a model of diversity. Among 68 top executives, only seven are non-Japanese and just one, a corporate auditor, is female.	-1.105660671
KANEGASAKI, Japan (Reuters) - At this 19-year-old Toyota factory in Kanegasaki, 500 km (300 miles) north of Tokyo, one shiny Aqua hybrid car rolls off the assembly line every 75 seconds, 17 hours a day.With 120,000 orders to fill from just the first month of sales since late December -- equivalent to 10 months�� worth of targeted sales in Japan -- the frantic pace will only quicken in the coming months.Toyota Motor Corp’s long-held plan of setting up a manufacturing base in Japan’s northeast coincides with the region’s efforts to rebuild itself up after being ravaged by the magnitude-9.0 earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis last March.The popularity of the Aqua and the business it could provide for ancillary parts makers could be a badly needed shot in the arm for the northeast, or Tohoku, territory.On top of the cost of rebuilding the devastated eastern coast, the frigid Tohoku region is home to an ailing electronics sector that has long been its cash cow. The strong yen and stiff global competition have caused huge losses on companies like TDK Corp and Renesas Electronics Corp, cranking up the pressure to close factories or shift work overseas, clouding the outlook for suppliers down the food chain.“If we lose our main source of income, it would be devastating for the local economy,�� said Keiji Sakuma, a director at the Tohoku Bureau of Economy, Trade and Industry. “In that sense, the auto industry could be our ray of hope.”Tohoku has attracted a long string of investments from Toyota, Japan’s top automaker, in the last few years.To diffuse the risk of a massive earthquake hitting its core manufacturing hub in central Japan, Toyota is on its way to establishing Tohoku as a third domestic production base, joining a second one on the southern island of Kyushu.In 2010, majority-owned subsidiary Prime Earth EV Energy built a factory in Miyagi prefecture to supply batteries for Toyota’s hybrids and plug-ins. Barely a month before the March 11 disasters, another subsidiary, Central Motor, opened a new assembly plant nearby to replace an ageing facility near Tokyo.Later this year, parts unit Toyota Motor Tohoku will open an engine factory, also in Miyagi, which accounted for more than half of the 16,000 deaths from the disasters last year.The Tohoku region will be in charge of developing and producing as many as 500,000 compact cars for Toyota a year. To maximize efficiency, Toyota will, in July, merge Central Motor, Toyota Motor Tohoku, and Kanto Auto Works, which operates the Aqua plant in Iwate prefecture, into a single company called Toyota Motor East Japan.“Thankfully, the Aqua has garnered tremendous support from customers,�� Kanto Auto Works president Tetsuo Hattori told reporters on Friday. “We hope that this car, produced here in Iwate, will serve as a bright spot for the recovery of Tohoku,�� he said ahead of a rare factory tour that was briefly interrupted by a moment of silence to mark one year since the disasters.With Toyota’s business growing in Tohoku, the region’s government expects an estimated 1,200 companies could get new or more work from the auto industry.Today, Tohoku’s contribution to Japan’s transport machinery sector is just 2.2 percent, compared with the 6 percent it contributes to the country’s gross domestic product and the 12-13 percent that electronic devices provide.“But once all the parts start moving in the auto sector, this (2.2 percent) figure should rise precipitously and that would spread to the electronic devices segment too,�� said the economy bureau’s Sakuma.Kanto Auto Works said its Iwate factory alone had hired an additional 200 contract workers to ramp up Aqua production to 30,000 a month for February and March, bringing total employment to around 2,500.Tohoku is also home to an engine factory of Nissan Motor Co. Japan’s No.2 automaker has said it would spend 3 billion yen ($37 million) to reinforce the plant, about 60 km from Fukushima’s crippled nuclear power plant, to guard against future earthquakes.While Toyota could prove a godsend for Tohoku, it won’t be smooth-sailing for the automaker. With the dollar trading around 81 yen, Toyota is struggling to make money on exports. Its huge global operations are cushioning the blow, but the disproportionate exposure to Japan has made a profit laggard out of Toyota.Toyota has committed to building 3 million of its 7.5 million vehicles a year in Japan, triple the volumes for both Nissan and Honda Motor Co. That is capping Toyota’s operating margin at an estimated 1.5 percent in the business year ending this month, far short of Nissan’s forecast of 5.4 percent and Hyundai Motor Co’s 10 percent last year.“When Toyota crafted this plan for Tohoku, the dollar was probably worth 120 yen, making Japan a low-cost country,�� Goldman Sachs auto analyst Kota Yuzawa said. “Now, Japan is a very high-cost country and Toyota’s got to work much harder.”Kanto Auto’s Hattori said even for his lean Iwate plant, 81 yen was tough for exports. The Iwate plant so far ships overseas one in every five Aquas it produces. The factory’s total exports have halved to 30 percent from pre-financial crisis levels, he said.Toyota’s executive vice president, Shinichi Sasaki, who oversees purchasing, is counting on Tohoku’s lower land prices and wages as well as government incentives for new business initiatives, to help it compete. Toyota hopes to double the amount of parts it buys in the region to 80 percent as soon as possible to lower delivery costs, he told reporters last week.In Iwate, Toyota’s ideas for saving money go beyond the factory floor. A few years ago, workers came up with the idea of employing goats to feed on the patches of green on site instead of using manpower and fuel to whack the weeds. During the winter, 1,500 tonnes of snow is stored to provide cool air during the summer rather than running the air-conditioning.For the factory, the pressure will rise after the initial excitement for the Aqua - the world’s cheapest and most fuel-efficient hybrid to date - runs its course.The car’s popularity in Japan is partly driven by government subsidies to replace older cars with hybrids and other fuel-sipping cars. That budget could run out in about half a year.“The real test will come in October,�� Goldman Sachs�� Yuzawa said. “At that point, when demand in Japan pulls back, we’ll see how well the car does in the United States. And if these exchange rates stick, it’s going to be painful.”The Aqua will go on sale as the Prius c in the United States in the coming months. It will also be sold in about 50 other countries, mostly in Asia.Economic sense or not, auto executives say the car industry, as a rare remaining bright spot in corporate Japan, has an obligation to do its part for the country, particularly when the prospects appear so bleak after the triple disasters.“If we upped and left, who would protect these jobs? Who will pay the taxes? Who will help with Japan’s recovery?�� Nissan’s chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga, who also heads Japan’s auto industry lobby, told Reuters last week.“We have no one to pass the baton to. If we as corporate citizens of Japan stopped caring, this country would be in a dire state.��($1 = 81.4000 Japanese yen)	-1.304662962

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has signed a deal with Vodafone Group Plc to install a private 5G network at the car maker’s electric-vehicle (EV) battery facility in UK’s Essex, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday.The project is part of a 65-million-pound ($80.87 million) investment in 5G backed by the UK government, according to Ford and Vodafone, and would be among the first of its kind in Britain.The private 5G network at Ford’s facility will replace older Wi-Fi networks and help speed up the production of EV components, according to the companies.“For a single EV product, this could generate more than a half a million pieces of data every minute��, the statement said, adding that the upgrade will provide faster and more accurate manufacturing control and analysis.Earlier this week, Toyota Production Engineering Corporation selected Finland’s Nokia Oyj to install an industrial-grade 5G private wireless network at its manufacturing design center in Fukuoka, Japan.	1.117628408
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T stuck to its commitment to improving petrol engines on Monday with new powertrain units, while flagging technologies which could find their way into electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs).The Japanese automaker plans to keep refining its petrol engines and the hybrid technology it pioneered two decades ago while also developing battery operated cars as tightening global emissions rules drive a race for longer-range affordable EVs.As high battery prices and range limitations restrain EV take-up, hybrids and plug-in hybrids would be dominant in coming years, Mitsumasa Yamagata, chief engineer at Toyota’s power train product planning division, said.Cars using petrol engines in some form would still account for around 90 percent of all vehicles by 2030, he added.“Developing the most fuel-efficient powertrains using petrol engines and hybrid systems will be the best way to have an impact (on reducing emissions), and we remain committed to this,�� he said at a briefing on Toyota’s new 2.0 liter petrol engine and hybrid systems, which can improve fuel economy by 18 percent and 9 percent, respectively, over its current systems.“At the same time, we will be able to use the technology developed for these powertrains in EVs and FCVs.”Already lagging Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, General Motors GM.N and BMW BMWG.DE in bringing a mass-production EV to market, Toyota has ramped up its EV development in the last year or so, pledging to add more than 10 EV models to its product line-up in the early 2020s after long touting a green-car strategy focusing mainly on hybrids and FCVs. Last week it announced it had developed ultra-powerful magnets containing fewer rare earth metals which can be used in EVs, while it has also partnered up with Panasonic Corp 6752.T to develop EV batteries.Yamagata said that components for petrol vehicles could also be used in EVs, including a new “launch�� gear used in Toyota’s continuously variable transmission unveiled on Monday which works with a smaller belt drive to enable smoother, more efficient initial acceleration and final deceleration.Industry experts anticipate that take-up of EVs will pick up faster than Toyota expects as decreasing battery costs result in a cost parity between EVs and gasoline-engine cars around 2025, but some say that it could leverage its lead in hybrid technology to help stay competitive during this transition.“Toyota has been developing its hybrid technology since the 1990s and has been improving it all along. This is complex technology which would take a lot of effort (for others) to develop originally,�� CLSA analyst Chris Richter said.	-4.160846872
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Several automakers on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected May sales in the United States, and the Detroit automakers said they will work through their annual summer shutdowns to rebuild inventories as demand recovers from coronavirus shutdowns.The U.S. auto sector has reopened assembly plants following the shutdown and automakers that reported May sales said they saw signs of recovery in consumer demand.Toyota Motor Corp7203.T, said overall U.S. sales fell about 26% in May, but retail demand rebounded to 86% of levels in May 2019, exceeding the company's forecasts. Retail sales almost doubled from April to May, a spokesman said.Hyundai Motor Co005380.KS said overall U.S. sales in May fell 13%, but that was significantly better than the 33% industry decline Cox Automotive had forecast. Hyundai cited a 5% increase in retail sales.No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co GM.N said it will keep building vehicles at most of its U.S. plants ""to meet strengthening customer demand,"" instead of taking a traditional two-week summer shutdown starting June 29, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.“Our share has been increasing and we want to be able to carry that momentum through to the other side of the pandemic,�� he said.Half of Ford Motor Co's F.N eight U.S. assembly plants have reduced their shutdowns to one week. Others are shifting their breaks to later in the year.GM and Ford no longer report monthly U.S. sales.The University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, closely followed by the auto sector, showed that 64% of those polled in May said it was a good time to buy a car.

TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T may consider mergers or acquisitions to procure new automotive technologies, including self-driving technologies, the company's president said on Wednesday, adding that it had to compete more aggressively against its rivals. At an annual shareholders meeting President Akio Toyoda said the world’s second-biggest automaker, which took longer to warm to self-driving cars and electric vehicles (EVs) than its rivals, would be more aggressive in expanding in these areas, conceding he may have focused too much on preserving the status quo at the firm until now.“The auto industry is undergoing big changes, and issues and ideas which we may have thought were far off in the future could affect us tomorrow. That’s why we need to go on the offensive while also preserving our areas of strength,�� he said.“We’ve been investing 1 trillion yen ($9.08 billion) each year for R&amp;D, expanding capex and buying back shares, but this may not be enough. We need to consider all our options, including M&amp;A, to survive in the future.”As the rise of self-driving cars increasingly blurs the lines between automakers and technology companies, global automakers are trying to expand their role beyond making cars into transportation service providers, raising their research and development budgets and investing heavily in technology companies.Toyota has invested $1 billion in an artificial intelligence research institute, and has struck up technology partnerships with Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Uber Technologies. It has also opened up to more companies beyond its group suppliers, including tech company Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, to procure more software for its automated driving systems.The automaker plans to launch a car in 2020 which can drive itself on highways. Meanwhile, rival Nissan Motor Co 7201.T is already aiming to get cars that can drive autonomously on city streets in that same year and General Motors Co GM.N says it has begun to mass-produce self-driving test vehicles.Toyota also has yet to ink a major capital tie-up with outside companies, after GM has scooped up U.S. autonomous driving technology company Cruise and partnered with ride services firm Lyft, while Ford Motor Co F.N has acquired ride-sharing service Chariot. Toyota late last year set up an electric car division, belatedly entering a market where Nissan, GM, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and other automakers already have offerings, as it continues to bet on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as the zero-emission car of the future. 	4.301380223
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has alerted U.S. safety officials about seat material in several vehicles that does not meet fire retardation standards, which could result in a recall depending on what the safety agency decides.The Japanese automaker said on Thursday it had stopped selling several models in North America equipped with seat heaters made since August 2012 after being alerted by South Korean safety officials that material in the part did not meet fire retardation standards also used in the United States. The cars are built in United States and some are exported to Korea.Toyota spokesman John Hanson said the company had informed the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the issue and would file an official report later on Thursday outlining the non-compliance with the standard. He added that Toyota did not feel a recall was necessary.“We don’t believe that it is a defect issue or a safety-related issue because there has been no occurrence of any problems out in the real world,�� Hanson said.There have been no reports of accidents, fires or injuries related to the issue in the affected vehicles in the United States, Canada or Mexico, he said.The NHTSA will make the final determination on whether a recall is needed, and Hanson said he did not know the timeline for that decision. Toyota does not know yet how many cars are affected by the issue, he said.NHTSA officials could not immediately be reached to comment.Toyota dealers have been told to stop selling any of the affected vehicles until the part can be replaced, Hanson said. The automaker will handle requests by individual owners to replace the part at no cost on a case-by-case basis.Affected vehicles are the Camry sedan, Camry hybrid, Avalon sedan, Avalon hybrid, Corolla subcompact, Sienna minivan and Tundra and Tacoma pickup trucks equipped with seat heaters that were sold since August 2012, when the fabric supplier was changed, he said.Toyota found out about the issue when it was notified that the seat heater did not pass a test conducted by the Korean Automotive Test and Research Institute (KATRI), which uses the same standard as NHTSA, Hanson said.The Korean agency found that the material in the seat heater does not meet standards that require it to retard a flame across the material surface at a specified rate, he said. KATRI notified Toyota of the failed compliance.	-1.010805159
TOKYO (Reuters) - Plenty of people think Honda Motor Co 7267.T is not the kind of daring, risk-taking company it once was. One of them is Takanobu Ito, who just happens to be the Japanese automaker's chief executive.His solution? A simple, gasoline-electric hybrid technology which he believes will set a new standard for fuel efficiency and recapture the success of the CVCC engine 40 years ago, which helped transform Honda from a small company into a global leader.Carmakers, battling to stand out in an industry hammered by over-capacity and weak demand, are looking for an optimum balance of gasoline and electricity to propel cars after Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T triumph with the Prius hybrid.Initially tentative in embracing the technology, Honda believes it has found the right formula with a revamped version of its “one motor�� hybrid system.“We believe we have reached a point with hybrid technology ... where we can provide game-changing technology and products,�� Ito told Reuters on Wednesday.“We believe that rivals will definitely follow us.”Honda’s new hybrid system will power the next generation of its cars and could be introduced in the remodelled Fit subcompact car by late 2013 in Japan, according to people close to the company.Honda introduced its “one motor�� hybrid system in 1999. It is currently used in models including the CR-Z compact sports car and the Fit subcompact, also known as the Jazz.Since becoming chief executive in 2009, the 59-year-old Ito has pushed Honda to come up with its own hybrid technology and repeat the successes of its hard-driving founder.Soichiro Honda championed advances such as fuel-efficient CVCC engines with cleaner tailpipe emissions in the 1970s, and saw them adopted by carmakers including Toyota, Ford and Chrysler.Honda needs that kind of a booster again.Hit in 2011 by a Japanese earthquake and tsunami and floods in Thailand that wrecked its production network, the company also suffered a lackluster launch for the 2012 Civic, which some criticized for an uninspired design and a bumpy ride.It is now counting on the new Accord mid-sized car, its core model for the U.S. market which was launched there this month. Ito said the car’s engine, transmission and platform have all undergone improvements, though it still lags behind Nissan’s Altima in fuel efficiency.Ito also sees the next Fit series as key to improving the company’s performance. For the North American market, the Fit will be built in Mexico and will go on sale in the spring of 2014, sources close to the firm said.Developing new technologies is costly and Honda, which spends about 500 billion yen ($6.4 billion) in R&amp;D annually, does not rule out alliances.“We absolutely won’t reject an alliance if we can work together with another company in a way that leads to our customers being more impressed with Honda’s products,�� Ito said.“But if we are just going to put onto our product an advanced technology that another company has developed, then Honda engineers will be deprived of the joy of involvement, so that is not the way to go.��	-8.114299494
TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Tuesday said it would add 400 jobs to build more SUVs at one of its U.S. plants, highlighting its expansion plans just as U.S. President Donald Trump calls on manufacturers to build more cars in the country.The Japanese automaker said the jobs were part of a $600 million upgrade of its plant in Princeton, Indiana, and were included in its plans announced earlier this month to invest $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years.The announcement comes as Trump focuses on protectionist trade policies during his administrations�� first week, including a formal withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday.The president has previously favored a 35 percent tariff on imported vehicles and pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada to promote a “buy American and hire American�� policy.He has also criticized automakers including Toyota for producing cars in neighboring Mexico for export to the United States and on Tuesday will have breakfast with the chief executives of General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles &lt;NV FCHA.MI&gt; to discuss boosting U.S. employment.Toyota last year produced around 1.4 million vehicles in the United States, its largest market. It operates 10 factories in the country, including the plant in Indiana which new Vice President Mike Pence visited while he was state governor.The automaker also operates a pickup truck assembly plant in Mexico, and is constructing a second site in the country, where it plans to build the Corolla sedan.Earlier this month, Trump in a tweet said Toyota could be subject to a “big border tax�� if it went ahead with plans to build the Mexico plant, which the automaker announced in 2015. Toyota has said its mid-term investment plans are not a response to Trump’s remarks.Like many automakers, Toyota has been ramping up production of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in the United States as low fuel prices spur demand for larger cars.It said the Indiana investment would increase production of its Highlander SUVs by an annual 40,000 vehicles from the second half of 2019, or around 17 percent from 2016 levels. The new jobs would add to the plant’s existing production line, which operates two shifts.Of the 10 U.S. Toyota plants, five assemble vehicles, and the Indiana plant is the second-largest of the assembly sites. It currently employs 5,100 people and last year produced around 402,000 vehicles.	-4.443137914
"DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to finish the year at a fast pace, with demand possibly at its highest in November, but Wall Street remains worried the industry could return to overly generous incentives that would eat into profits.Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters see the annual sales rate for U.S. new-vehicle sales in November finishing at 15.6 million vehicles. And some analysts said the rate could top 16 million, which would mark the strongest pace of the year.“Our marketing is there, our inventories are good, our product is really good; we just need a good finish,�� Tim Coad, owner of Coad Family Dealerships in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, said in a telephone interview.Coad said sales at his Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota stores are on pace to match last year’s strong results.Monthly sales are regarded as an early indicator of the U.S. economy’s health. The industry has held up better than the broader economy because of easier access to credit and consumers�� need to replace aging vehicles, which now average more than 11 years.But some analysts are worried about rising incentives biting into companies�� profit margins. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said General Motors Co executives at the LA Auto Show last week agreed “there are some warning signs brewing in industry sales momentum and discipline�� with incentives heating up.RBC Capital Markets sees industry incentives up 4 percent in November over last year, and analysts and industry officials cited generous or rising offers from Ford Motor Co F.N, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, GM GM.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. Ford's incentives on its F-150 pickups were up 12 percent, according to Barclays and Buckingham Research Group.Meanwhile, GM is touting its Black Friday sales deals where consumers can buy certain Chevy, Buick and GMC models at prices paid by employees of suppliers. Coad said the deals are not as crazy as prior decades when he saw offers of up to $10,000 off.GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company headed into November with incentives that were below the industry average and that gave it “room to maneuver.”The U.S. auto industry is scheduled to report November sales on December 3, and analysts who closely follow the industry see sales rising in a range of 3.6 percent to 6.8 percent as demand returns to “normal�� after the 16-day government shutdown hurt October results.John Humphrey, senior vice president of J.D. Power’s global auto practice, said consumer spending on new cars is likely to top $370 billion this year, which would be the highest on record and above pre-recession levels. That includes more than $30 billion in November, when the research firm expects the annual sales pace to hit 16.1 million vehicles.Not everyone is as optimistic about November. Honda Motor Co's 7267.T U.S. sales chief John Mendel told reporters last Friday that while sales will rise thanks to the month's five weekends including Thanksgiving, it ""does not look as robust as everyone is saying."" He expects Honda's sales to increase 3 percent.The three U.S. automakers are all expected to show gains in the month, marked by continued strong end-of-the-year demand for full-size pickup trucks like GM's Chevy Silverado, Ford's F-150 and Chrysler Group's FIA.MI Ram.Sales at GM are expected to rise 8 percent to 15 percent, while those at Chrysler are seen increasing 7 percent to 10 percent helped by the first full month of availability of its new Jeep Cherokee mid-sized sport utility vehicle. Ford’s sales are predicted to rise 3 percent to 6.7 percent.Kelley Blue Book expects demand in the month for compact crossover utility vehicles and large pickups to rise almost 24 percent and 8 percent, respectively.Most analysts and industry executive expect U.S. overall U.S. sales this year to finish at 15.5 million to 15.6 million vehicles, up from 14.5 million last year. Barclays and J.D. Power predict sales in 2014 will rise again, hitting 16.2 million and 16.1 million respectively.RBC surveyed dealers and 45 percent said they were somewhat or significantly more optimistic about the next six months, up from 42 percent last month.However, Toyota’s North American chief Jim Lentz said last week that the pent-up demand that has driven the industry to strong growth the last few years will slow in 2014."	-2.659531986

FREMONT, Calif (Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk, an entrepreneur known for his outsized ambition, on Friday made a stunning forecast: battery-powered cars will likely match the internal combustion engine in popularity by the middle of the next decade.“In 20 years more than half of new cars manufactured will be fully electric,�� Musk said. “I feel actually quite safe in that bet. That’s a bet I will put money on.”Musk, who divides his time between Tesla and his space exploration startup SpaceX, said it might even happen sooner than that.“It’s probably going to be in the 12- to 15-year time frame,�� he said, speaking at an event at Tesla’s manufacturing plant in Fremont, where he handed over the keys to the first buyers of the new Model S sedan.Electric vehicles have struggled to find an audience beyond Hollywood celebrities, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and policymakers in Washington, primarily due to their premium pricing and anxieties about their driving range.Most analysts see pure electric cars accounting for only a single-digit percentage of total sales over the next decade, in part because of the cost of batteries and the uncertainty around continued government subsidies for the new technology.Rival automaker Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, the most bullish mass-market car maker, forecasts that by 2020 10 percent of all cars sold will be electric. In an interview with Reuters on Friday in Tokyo, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said he believed that forecast was attainable if enough automakers followed Nissan into offering EVs.Musk, the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark character in “Iron Man,�� has overcome odds and a turbulent time at the carmaker, marked by a near-debilitating financial crisis, to now deliver the second car in its portfolio. The company also sells the Roadster sports car.In addition to Tesla, Musk founded SpaceX, which last month sent the first privately developed ship into space to dock with the International Space Station, and online payments site PayPal, now part of eBay EBAY.O.Despite the slow adoption of electric vehicles, many automakers are planning to launch them to meet rising fuel efficiency standards.Apart from General Motors'GM.N Volt and Nissan's all-electric Leaf, Toyota has begun selling a plug-in Prius, and EVs from Ford, Honda, BMW and Fiat will join the fray this year, along with cars from start-up Coda Automotive.Tesla, which has said it has adopted a slow, methodical approach to the launch, expects to deliver 5,000 Model S sedans by the end of 2012. Reservations for the sedan have topped 10,000.The company expects to deliver over 20,000 vehicles next year, Musk said.The owner of the first Model S to roll off the assembly is Steve Jurvetson, managing director of venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, an early investor in Tesla. Musk gets the second Model S.Tim Draper, founder and managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, received his keys on Friday after having waited nearly three years for the car.“It’s the smoothest car I have ever driven,�� Draper said, who also likes its large touch navigation screen.The Model S is the electric carmaker’s most crucial launch yet as it represents the company’s transition to the mass market.Tesla has described 2012 as a “year with two halves�� with the Model S launch as the dividing line. Ninety percent of the company’s revenue this year is expected to come from the sedan.Tesla also draws revenue from its partnerships with Toyota Motor Co's 7203.T and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE. In February, Tesla announced an expanded deal with Daimler to create an electric powertrain for a new Mercedes Benz EV.Musk said that while he was positive about Tesla’s powertrain business, he added ��10 CEOs determine whether we have a powertrain business or not.”Tesla was talking to a major carmaker about a “high volume�� powertrain deal, Musk said, but did not give any details.Tesla also makes the powertrain system for the electric Toyota RAV4. Toyota, which unveiled the model last month, said it projects to sell 2,600 of the sport-utility vehicle over the next three years in the United States.The Model S base model will be priced at about $57,000, before a $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit, for a car that can travel 160 miles on a full charge.More popular will be the Model S version that will be able to travel 230 miles on a full charge. That version will cost $10,000 more. A version of the Model S that will have a range of 300 miles will cost another $10,000.	-2.44447365
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will raise its stake in Subaru Corp 7270.T to 20% from around 17%, the two Japanese automakers said on Friday, as they leverage their scale to better compete in developing new vehicle technologies.The investment comes a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T, said they would take small equity stakes in each other. Such tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development required to develop self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services which are upending the global auto industry.“In this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation, by strengthening their bonds and aligning their capabilities, Toyota and Subaru aim ... to make ever-better cars,�� Toyota said in a statement.Japan’s biggest automaker whose annual global vehicle sales are 10 times that of Subaru, said its investment would amount to up to 80 billion yen ($742 million) based on Subaru’s stock market value. The smaller automaker will reciprocate by buying a stake in Toyota of equal value.Traditional car makers, especially smaller ones such as Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry which is shifting to a business model of providing transportation services from simply selling cars to drivers.Their deepening partnerships with Toyota, which already oversees a vast, closely knit network of group companies that include suppliers, vendors and commercial vehicle makers, has raised speculation that these smaller automakers may be absorbed into the Toyota fabric in the future.“The plan appears to be to ultimately make Subaru a fully owned subsidiary, to help create a ‘mega Toyota��. This is the first step toward that,�� said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. “It’s all about building scale.”But Subaru President Tomomi Nakamura was adamant that his company would remain independent for now.“I can assure you that there was absolutely no talk of Subaru becoming a Toyota subsidiary ... either from our side or theirs,�� Subaru President Tomomi Nakamura told reporters after the announcement.Car makers around the world are joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. Ford Motor Co F.N and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.Friday's deal cements Subaru's place in Toyota's expanding group of Japanese partners, which include Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Yamaha Motor Co 7272.T.Rival Nissan Motor Co 7201.T has an alliance with France's Renault RENA.PA, although that has been shaken following the ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, and with Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T.Honda Motor Co 7267.T has a tie-up with General Motors GM.N.Subaru, which produces the Outback and Forester SUVs, is known for its horizontally placed boxer engines, along with its EyeSight autonomous driver assist and all-wheel-drive technologies.The two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to share costs.Toyota seems to be keen on investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.It has been building its holding in Subaru since first acquiring a 9.5% stake in the company, then called Fuji Heavy Industries, in 2005.

TOKYO, June 30 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investors are flooding stock brokers with orders for a new class of Toyota Motor Corp shares, indicating the carmaker can fetch a good price for the issue and secure a new group of long-term investors.Nomura Securities Co, which is handling the sale of the shares, has received 10 times more applications to buy shares than the automaker plans to sell in the retail-only issue, said two sources at Japan’s biggest brokerage who were briefed on the customer orders. They declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the public.“There are customers who closed their bank time deposits and applied for Toyota shares,�� said a salesman at a Nomura branch in Tokyo.In another sign of strong interest in the new issue, Nomura has seen new accounts opened with it jump by 80 percent from normal levels since Toyota announced the sale, according to another Nomura official.Investors are attracted to the unlisted Toyota “Model AA�� issue because the shares will pay an annual dividend starting at 0.5 percent and gradually rising to 2.5 percent in the fifth year.That compares with returns of about 0.05 percent or lower for five-year retail Japanese government bonds and time deposits at major banks.Investors must hold the stock for five years, after which they can convert them to common shares or have Toyota buy them back at the issue price.The sale could have consequences for other companies seeking stable long-term investors. Finance company Orix Corp has said it is considering a similar issue and will be watching Toyota’s market experiment.Nomura is limiting the sale to 50,000 shares per investor, but the strong interest could mean that not everyone who wants to buy will be able to do so.Toyota plans to sell up to 500 billion yen ($4 billion) of Model AA shares. It will price the issue as early as Thursday, and by next Tuesday at the latest, at 26-30 percent above the closing price of the common stock on that day.The world’s biggest carmaker by sales aims eventually to sell 150 million shares, just under 5 percent of its outstanding shares.The new stock has faced opposition from foreign funds as the shares are only readily available in Japan. Toyota argues the shares would give investors more options in a country where most of the $14 trillion in financial assets held by individuals are in cash deposits.	-0.1047904192
TOKYO (Reuters) - Takata Corp said it is willing to support car makers replacing certain air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 that were supplied to multiple car makers, including Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, for vehicles sold in the United States.The world’s second-biggest automotive safety parts maker said in a letter, dated June 11, to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it will support replacements of certain driver-side air bag inflators made between January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2007, as well as certain passenger side inflators made between June 2000 and July 31, 2004.Besides Honda and Toyota, Takata said that it believes these inflators were also supplied to BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp.The company said that, if automakers agree, it will support the replacement of those inflators in vehicles in high humid areas of Puerto Rico, Florida, Hawaii and the Virgin Islands.Last year, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda and BMW recalled around 4 million vehicles globally over flawed air bag inflators, made by Takata, that are at risk of exploding and shooting out shrapnel at passengers and drivers. Takata has attributed the flaw to manufacturing problems.That came on top of seven earlier recalls for similar problems by Honda since November 2008.Takata also said in the letter that “neither Takata nor the vehicle manufacturers conducting these field actions would be expected to admit that its product contain such a (safety) defect,�� saying currently available information does not indicate so.	1.885343798

BERLIN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ulrich Hackenberg isn’t yet a household name but if Volkswagen’s $70 billion bet on his big idea pays off, he may join the likes of Henry Ford, Alfred Sloan and Taiichi Ohno in the canon of auto industry pioneers.Since the heyday of Henry Ford and his Model T, the world’s automakers have considered the “global car�� to be their Holy Grail - the same basic design that can be built, in subtle variations, and sold in different markets.Take that fundamental concept, stretch it across many different vehicle types, sizes and brands, then build them by the millions, and you begin to sense the enormity of Volkswagen’s rapidly evolving “mega-platform�� strategy and its potential impact on competitors around the globe.Auto engineer Hackenberg nurtured this bright idea for three decades, after early pitches to auto executives were largely ignored, until somebody finally bought it wholesale. The man who bit was Volkswagen Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn.Hackenberg’s fundamental rethink of vehicle platforms, the industrial Lego from which cars are designed and made, is helping power the German company to the top of the global sales charts several years ahead of its 2018 target. It could also make VW one of the most profitable carmakers in the world.The strategy is not without risk. It could, for instance, expose Volkswagen to the threat of a massive global recall if a single part, used in millions of cars, fails.But rivals have taken note of the power behind its move. Volkswagen’s modular platforms are being benchmarked by most of the world’s top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Ford Motor Co, according to company executives.“We’d be crazy not to,�� said a senior Ford official, requesting anonymity because of the proprietary nature of the subject.VW’s work on its largest mega-platform, known internally as MQB, began in earnest in 2007 and is being implemented over the next four years at a cost of nearly $70 billion, estimates Morgan Stanley. The potential payoff is compelling: Projected annual gross savings by 2019 of $19 billion, according to the bank, with gross margins approaching 10 percent.The automaker is expected to announce a record profit for 2012 of more than $30 billion later this month (February 22), according to Bernstein Research, whose senior analyst, Max Warburton, observes: “VW looks to have unstoppable momentum �� in China, the U.S., Europe and most of the rest of the world.”That momentum has been building for some time, even before the initial deployment last year of Hackenberg’s brainchild.Industry-leading levels of commonality �� the proportion of parts that can be shared among different models �� are nothing new to VW. At a gathering in Japan five years ago, Renault and Nissan executives lifted the hoods on several VW Group vehicles side by side �� including models from Skoda, Seat and Audi brands �� and saw trouble.“They had the same engines, the same clutches, the same ventilation �� all identical parts,�� says an executive who attended the presentation. “It was a level of commonality that didn’t exist at Renault-Nissan.”Late in 2011, as the outlook darkened for French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen, its board was given a similar demonstration, and a similar shock, at the company’s high-security research center in Velizy, southwest of Paris. Technicians took apart the front ends of two different VW cars and swapped most of their components.“They were a little dumbstruck by the realization that there was a whole new world out there �� and their development was 10 years behind,�� recalls one participant.After a six-year gestation, VW has just begun to implement its sophisticated and highly flexible platform with the deceptively simple label MQB, a German acronym for “modular transverse matrix.�� Virtually all of the group’s small and medium front-wheel-drive family models, including the latest generations of the VW Golf and Audi A3, are being designed around MQB as their base.The new platform features a far greater degree of plug-and-play modularity, flexibility and parts commonality than at Toyota, General Motors Co, Ford and other competitors.MQB “could be the single most important automotive initiative of the past 25 years,�� says Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Consulting in Northville, Michigan. “It really changes the game.”With the new mega-platform strategy supporting its 12 brands, from spartan Skoda to Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, VW is poised to snatch the global sales crown from Toyota as early as next year, according to investment bank Morgan Stanley.VW envisions enormous leverage from MQB. The plan is to boost global sales to 10 million or more, with roughly two out of every three cars �� some 40-plus models totaling 6.3 million sales a year �� built on some variation of the MQB platform, according to U.S. research firm IHS Automotive.None of VW’s competitors has the diversity of brands, the breadth of technology, the sweeping geographic footprint or the deep pockets necessary to support and take advantage of such a wide-reaching initiative as MQB.Even Toyota, the current global sales leader, is playing catch-up with its German rival.“There’s no doubt we have fallen behind,�� says a senior Toyota executive who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the subject. “We have not even begun to make the fundamental structural changes that VW has�� in designing and applying flexible vehicle platforms.The sense from competitors and auto analysts is that VW’s rollout of MQB is likely to be as influential as such earlier innovations as Ford’s adaptation of standardized parts, GM’s “ladder�� of brands and Toyota’s streamlined production system.VW’s suppliers see MQB as a watershed event, a break with a past when really big vehicle platforms might have yielded orders for as many as 5 million or 6 million identical components over their typical six- to seven-year life cycle.Now, with the implementation of MQB, “they’re being asked for quotes on 35 million parts,�� says a senior European industry executive.More importantly, the modularity enables VW to design, engineer and build a wide variety of vehicle size and shapes - from a subcompact Polo hatchback to a full-size, seven-passenger crossover that’s due in the United States in 2015.The flexibility of the MQB system also allows VW to create more cars that are more tailored for specific markets at a lower cost, and it doesn’t have to sell so many units to break even, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Stuart Pearson.MQB isn’t the only weapon in Hackenberg’s arsenal.Larger Audi, VW and Porsche models with longitudinal engines �� mounted in a north-south configuration �� will use a similar set of components dubbed MLB that already underpins a number of Audi vehicles.And many of the group’s ultra-luxury and performance brands will employ a third component set called MSB, designed for premium rear- and all-wheel-drive vehicles such as the Porsche 911, the Bentley Continental and the Lamborghini Gallardo.Each of the three modular component sets will come in different variations that will enable enormous flexibility in terms of product design, while accommodating a wide range of powertrain options, from gas and diesel engines to electric motors and batteries.“Modular platforms have grown beyond the technology (alone) to become a management tool which helps support the brands�� development. The toolkits help the brands to preserve their character and sharpen their individuality,�� said Hackenberg, now development chief for the Volkswagen brand.The modular toolkits seem like the ideal complement to VW’s other strengths, not the least of which is the company’s sheer size: Group revenue this year is projected by Bernstein Research to top $275 billion.But the huge volumes planned for the MQB derivatives alone could also expose the group to the same sort of mass recalls of millions of cars experienced in recent years by Japanese rival Toyota. If a single part has a problem, and that part is in many different models, a recall affects many more vehicles.Analysts, including Morgan Stanley’s Pearson and Frankfurt-based Metzler Bank analyst Juergen Pieper, also express concern about VW’s growing reliance on emerging markets, notably China, for future growth.The company was an early investor in China and the only European automaker to form joint ventures with that country’s top two manufacturers, FAW Group and Shanghai Auto.Now, China accounts for 30 percent of VW’s global sales. The German group operates 10 assembly/component factories in China and plans to pump another $13 billion with its JV partners over the next three years into plants, equipment and models.Excess exposure to a single market such as China contradicts VW’s philosophy of spreading growth evenly and potentially makes it vulnerable to negative market developments and possible government interference, says Pieper.To hedge its potential emerging-markets exposure, VW also has overhauled its loss-making North American operations - an estimated $4-billion investment, according to Morgan Stanley, that could more than double U.S. sales by 2018 to 1.3 million.Even then, it would remain a mid-level player in the U.S. market dominated by GM and Ford, which sell nearly 5 million vehicles a year between them.VW is supporting its recent growth spurt with additional production capacity, including a new Audi assembly plant in Mexico, expansion of VW’s existing facility in Puebla and a potential increase at the new Chattanooga plant in Tennessee.The latter two plants will be updated to accommodate new models that use the MQB platform - the latest Golf in Puebla and the big crossover in Chattanooga, according to VW executives.Top managers are scanning other overseas markets where the company lacks local production facilities, including Africa, much of Latin America and most of the ASEAN region, where VW’s modest presence is dwarfed by that of market leader Toyota.VW is in the process of boosting global capacity, including the investments in China and the United States, to nearly 12 million by 2015, from 8.6 million in 2010, according to Morgan Stanley.The full rollout of MQB may not be accomplished until the end of the decade, estimates Pearson. By then, the chief stewards of VW’s corporate strategy - CEO Winterkorn and Chairman Ferdinand Piech - may be retired and the next generation of management moved into the top slots.The Austrian-born Piech, 75, is a third-generation auto executive. A mechanical engineer by training, he is the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, the legendary Austrian designer of the original VW Beetle.VW’s supervisory board has yet to clearly anoint potential heirs to Piech and Winterkorn, 65, and it won’t be easy, particularly since much of the power has been closely held by the two patriarchs since Winterkorn became CEO in 2007.As for the company’s strategic vision after Piech steps down, Morgan Stanley’s Pearson says: “His legacy is (building) the world’s largest and most successful auto company. I don’t think the strategy will change any time soon.��	-2.813178514
Saturday night’s Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Kansas Speedway has garnered rave reviews for its parity and competitiveness. Fords, Chevrolets and Toyotas all led laps and played into the final outcome.Brad Keselowski’s Kansas victory -- his third win of the season -- means the sport has seen drivers from all three manufacturers hoist trophies in the past three weeks -- Chevrolet at Talladega, Toyota at Dover and Ford this past weekend.It was a similar multi-manufacturer display directly atop the Kansas scoring pylon with Keselowski’s Ford leading Chevrolet’s Alex Bowman and Toyota’s Erik Jones to the checkered flag.There were 10 different race leaders -- eight of whom led double-digit laps. Five of the drivers who finished in the top 15 at Kansas started 30th or worse. It all speaks to the possibilities that exist with this new technical package at the 1.5-mile tracks.“With this package you have to be really scrappy and really fight for every spot,�� said Joe Gibbs Racing driver Erik Jones. “They’re just really valuable and really tough to get.”And that kind of “fight�� for every position, every lap, is what the NASCAR sanctioning body has been intent to deliver.The racing is more naturally like that on the superspeedways at Talladega and Daytona, but judging by the race on Saturday night, it’s something to expect more of at the 1.5-mile tracks as the teams figure out the technical package, and the drivers negotiate the intense competition on every lap.It’s all a positive sign for the sport as it heads into the Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway this weekend.The popular $1 million-to-win All-Star event in NASCAR’s North Carolina backyard is followed a week later at the track by the longest event on the schedule -- the Coca-Cola 600 -- all capping a highly-anticipated Memorial Day race slate.Last year’s Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star race was essentially a high-profile test ground for the new package that has since been implemented full time in 2019. It produced a thrilling show that included 38 green flag passes for the lead and ultimately a cool million-dollar paycheck for winner Kevin Harvick.Drivers fully expect to see a similarly competitive atmosphere in Charlotte during the next two weeks.“I think it’s part package and part the way the race played out,�� Jones said of the Kansas weekend.“The package tonight was the closest iteration that NASCAR is, what I’m guessing, shooting for. We were very close to wide open and there was definitely some pack-racing moments after the restarts and stuff like that.”Not only did Keselowski’s effort at Kansas tie him with Kyle Busch for most wins (three) on the season, his Team Penske teammate, reigning series champion Joey Logano, wrangled the championship points lead away from Busch, too.Logano now leads the 2015 champion (Busch) by nine points heading into the non-points-paying All-Star weekend -- the first time in nine weeks Busch isn’t atop the series standings.Perhaps more so than in years past, the always-anticipated Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race will not only be an opportunity to connect with fans and work toward a huge paycheck, it will be an important check-up for the team’s package heading into the 600-miler at the track the following week.Chip Ganassi Racing’s Kurt Busch is the last driver to win both the All-Star race and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same season (2010).And with the 600’s evening start time, Keselowski was pretty sure Saturday’s Kansas night-time thriller would also be a good indicator of where things may stand for the Coca-Cola 600.“I felt like going into this race that this would be a good -- especially with it being a night race and being cool temps, this would be a strong showing for these rules and for the ability to pass and do those things,�� Keselowski said. “And obviously I’m a little biased because I won the race, but I felt like it was.“I feel like you saw the cars run closer than they probably ever have here and saw some pretty good battles throughout the day. And that’s definitely because the rules package. It has its strengths and weaknesses, and if there’s going to be a strength, it’s going to be races like this, and I feel like it delivered.��--By Holly Cain, NASCAR Wire Service.

(Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Tuesday ordered Toyota Motor Corp to pay nearly $11 million after finding that an accelerator defect in a 1996 Camry was at fault for a 2006 fatal car crash in Minnesota.Following a three-week trial, jurors in Minnesota federal court deliberated for four days before finding Toyota 60 percent liable for the crash, according to plaintiffs�� lawyers. Koua Fong Lee, the Camry’s driver, was found 40 percent responsible, according to lawyers.The plaintiffs said that the crash was caused by a defect in the Camry’s accelerator that caused it to become stuck, and the brakes failed to work.Toyota denied that the car was at fault, and said the driver had been negligent. A spokeswoman for Toyota, Amanda Rice, said it was weighing its legal options.The car in the accident was not covered by Toyota’s recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2010 over acceleration issues.The Minnesota trial stemmed from a lawsuit filed on behalf of passengers injured or killed in a 2006 crash in St. Paul, Minnesota. Lee, who later joined the suit, said he was driving his 1996 Toyota Camry when it inexplicably began to accelerate as he approached other vehicles stopped at an intersection, according to court filings.The Camry slammed into an Oldsmobile Ciera, killing the driver, Javis Trice-Adams Sr., as well as his 9-year old son, according to the 2010 lawsuit. A 6-year old girl who was also in the car was paralyzed and later died. Two other passengers were seriously injured, according to the lawsuit.Lee was charged in connection with the crash and served nearly three years in prison for vehicular homicide, according to his lawyer, Robert Hilliard. In 2010, when reports of unintended acceleration in other Toyota vehicles surfaced, Lee won a motion to set aside his conviction, and he was released from prison.Bill Markovits, a lawyer for the estate of the 6-year old girl and one of the injured passengers, said that his clients felt vindicated by the jury verdict. A lawyer for other passengers of the Ciera could not immediately be reached for comment.Hilliard said that while Lee would not be able to regain the years he spent in prison, he was glad that the jury had rejected Toyota’s attempts to lay the blame entirely on him.	1.665661743

TOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell to a one-month low on Monday as selloff gripped the market on the first trading day of 2020 on fears of an impact to global economic growth from a flare up in tensions between the United States and Iran.U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened a “major retaliation�� against Iran if Tehran were to hit back for the killing of one of its top military commanders.The Nikkei share average fell 2.09% to 23,161.16, breaking below two-major support levels - 25-day moving average around 23,600 and 50-day average around 23,350 - to its lowest level since Dec. 4.The broader Topix lost 1.75% to 1,691.20, falling to its lowest levels since late November. The Tokyo stock market was closed from Tuesday to Friday last week for New Year holidays.“The market will have to go through some correction. It was a bit overvalued to begin with, but the problems in the Middle East are the main drag now,�� said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities.Concerns about a further escalation in the Middle East tension hit shippers and airlines, which fell 4.0% and 2.5%, respectively.As the yen gained on safe-haven buying, a wide range of exporter shares took a hit. Honda Motor fell 2.8%, while Fanuc dropped 2.2% and Toyota Motor Corp 2.2%.Two Nikkei heavyweights, SoftBank and Fast Retailing, also posted fairly large fall of 3.6% and 2.6%.Meanwhile, a spike in oil prices helped oil companies, with the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s oil and coal producer index rising 2.9%.Nissan Motor fell 1.5%, in line with the overall market, to an eight-year low. Its former chairman Carlos Ghosn fled Japan while on bail during Japan’s market holidays.Ghosn faced four charges - which he has denied - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan had sacked him as chairman saying internal investigations revealed misconduct including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.

(Adds details on the policy, comments from Toyota Thailand, industry context)* Malaysia to let foreign auto makers produce small hybrids* Aims to export 200,000 eco-friendly cars by 2020, create 150,000 jobs* Mazda, Perodua pledge $682 mln to build plants* Toyota Thailand says boosting investment in Malaysia is not easyBy Yantoultra NguiKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Malaysia will let foreign companies such as Japan’s Mazda and Honda make small hybrid cars in Southeast Asia’s No.3 economy, which is competing with Thailand and Indonesia to be the regional hub for low-emission vehicles.Malaysia, which until now only let foreign companies make larger cars, plans to offer new production licences, grants and lower taxes, just as flooding and political instability thwart Thailand’s push to boost output and demand of small, eco-friendly cars.Malaysia - known for beleagured national car Proton Holdings Bhd - wants to develop the auto market as it works toward its goal of raising the economy to developed status by 2020.By that time, it aims to export 200,000 energy-efficient cars, achieve $3 billion of car component shipments and create 150,000 jobs, International Trade and Industry Minister Mustapa Mohamed said on Monday when announcing the country’s automotive policy.So far, Mazda Motor Corp and local manufacturer Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua (Perodua) have pledged 2.25 billion ringgit ($682.44 million) for investment in energy-efficient vehicle production, Mustapa said.“We hope this National Automotive Policy (NAP) 2014 can enable us to become the energy efficient vehicle hub in ASEAN in the future,�� Mustapa said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.“We hope to raise total production volume to 1.25 million vehicles by 2020 from some 0.57 million vehicles.”The new policy opens the way for foreign auto makers to produce gasoline and battery powered passenger cars with engine sizes of 1.8 litres or less, Mustapa said.This would immediately benefit Honda Motor Co Ltd, which already has a hybrid car manufacturing plant in Malaysia, as well compatriot Nissan Motor Co Ltd, which has production facilities and a distribution network for conventional gasoline-powered cars.Toyota Motor Corp said Malaysia’s attractiveness as a hub for energy-efficient vehicles is limited.Boosting investment in Malaysia is not easy, said Kyoichi Tanada, president of Toyota’s Thai unit, said at a separate news conference in Bangkok on Monday.“Thailand is still in a better position given the size of market.”Toyota sold about 90,000 to 100,000 vehicles in Malaysia last year compared with 445,000 vehicles in Thailand.Overall, around 652,000 vehicles were sold in Malaysia last year, over half of which were from Perodua and DRB-Hicom unit Proton, government officials have said.That figure is roughly half of Thailand’s 1.33 million vehicles and Indonesia’s 1.22 million vehicles.Malaysia was Southeast Asia’s automotive hub before being overtaken in the early 2000s by Thailand, which has followed a more open policy toward foreign car makers setting up factories and selling cars domestically.	-4.258675079
GUANGZHOU/BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - China’s car buyers are growing up - with a more discerning view on the bang they want for their buck - and that could help Japanese automakers recover in a market where sales have been battered in protests over disputed East China Sea islets.While Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp count the cost of lost sales and dented profits from a violent anti-Japanese backlash in September, industry experts say now is the time to strike deeper into the world’s biggest autos market rather than limp away and lick their wounds.Paul Gao, a Hong Kong-based researcher at U.S. consultant McKinsey &amp; Co, said the damage to Japanese brands should prove to be a “temporary phenomenon�� as tensions were heightened in the run-up to this month’s 18th Communist Party Congress - China’s once-in-a-decade leadership change.“Over the medium- to long-term, the Japanese (market) share in China will recover because for customers, especially those buying cars with their own money ... the nationality of the brand is not a major consideration, whether it’s Japanese, Korean, whatever. In the end, they think about performance, styling, fuel economy and safety,�� Gao said, adding it would be a mistake for the Japanese to shift focus away from China.He said the Japanese should now be “doubling their efforts�� to win back China market share from Volkswagen, General Motors and Hyundai Motor, as more drivers are now getting around to replacing their cars.“For their first car, as they had no ownership experience, they gravitated towards flashy cars and were impressed by advertising and sales campaigns. Now they are looking for something more rational - quality, safety, durability - areas where Japanese brands like Toyota excel,�� he said.Demand for leading Japanese car brands in China virtually halved last month, cutting Japanese firms�� market share to 17 percent from 19 percent at end-August.Blaming the China impact, Nissan - the most exposed of the three big Japanese automakers to China - cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth, while Honda also revised down its forecasts for the year by 20 percent. Toyota, also badly hit in China, managed to increase its annual profit forecast as it is less exposed to that market. China accounts for 27 percent of Nissan’s total vehicle sales, a fifth of Honda’s sales and 12 percent of Toyota’s global sales.Mazda said on Thursday it expects its China car sales to fall by more than a third this month from a year earlier, dragging fourth-quarter sales down by around 40 percent, but the firm’s China chief, Noriaki Yamada, hoped China would be back to ‘business as usual�� by the end of March.Speaking on the sidelines of the Guangzhou autoshow in southeastern China, the first major industry event since the anti-Japanese protests, Yamada said Mazda was also changing tack on the way it markets its brand in China - preferring a more direct and personal touch than traditional mass media advertising.“We need to increase the opportunities where we and our customers can directly interact,�� he told reporters, noting Mazda would invite more potential buyers to test drive its cars, take part in more of China’s local auto shows and further expand its dealership network. “We think it’s better to allocate our budget on these events rather than on advertising.”In a bid to win back the hearts and wallets of Chinese drivers weeks after Tokyo’s nationalisation of two islets - known to Chinese as the Diaoyu and to Japanese as the Senkaku - Japan’s carmakers have compensated car owners and dealers for damage and injuries incurred during the protests - though this has been a low-key campaign as they don’t want to invite a flood of unrelated claims. None of the carmakers has said how many cases are involved or how much they expect to pay out.“We need to shoulder responsibility if they face challenges,�� Ren Yong, vice president of Nissan’s local joint venture with Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd, told reporters at the Guangzhou event. The venture said it will offer a new car to buyers returning a vehicle over a quality issue - within 7 days of purchase and with mileage below 1,000 km.While recovery in China will be helped by a softening yen - the Japanese currency has weakened to 82 to the dollar from around 77.5 in late-September, making exports more competitive - it could be the Japanese firms�� quality, value-for-money and cost management that seal the recuperation.“Japanese firms may not produce the most eye-catching products or brand marketing campaigns, but they invest in the long-term relationship with suppliers to improve the cost structure and improve the quality. This is what Americans and Germans don’t do that well,�� said McKinsey’s Gao.	6.50624927
DETROIT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The shutdown of the federal government put a crimp in U.S. auto sales in the first half of October, but new-vehicle purchases for the month will still rise 8 percent from a year ago, J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday.The two consultancies jointly forecast October sales of 15.4 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis.John Humphrey, senior vice president of J.D. Power’s global automotive practice, said that while sales took a hit during the government shutdown during the first 16 days of the month, they have since rebounded.“Sales in the third week of the month strengthened relative to the first two weeks, which is evidence of vehicle buyers delaying their purchase until the shutdown was resolved,�� Humphrey said.Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive, said the group’s 2013 forecast remains unchanged at 15.6 million new vehicles sold, up from 14.5 million last year.While Schuster said that U.S. auto sales of more than 16 million vehicles is “well within reach�� next year, he cautioned that consumer confidence may suffer if the U.S. Congress again goes into gridlock as it considers raising the national debt ceiling.Forecasters Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book also showed expectations of auto sales gains for the month.Edmunds.com was the most bullish of the three agencies that issued forecasts on Thursday, predicting a 13 percent rise in sales and an annualized rate of 15.5 million vehicles.Kelley Blue Book said October U.S. auto sales will rise 12 percent, and an annualized sales rate for the month of 15.4 million vehicles.KBB said major automakers will all show increases in October sales from a year ago. These include General Motors Co, with 8 percent growth; Ford Motor Co, up 14 percent; Toyota Motor Corp, up 16 percent; Chrysler Group LLC, up 12.5 percent; and Honda Motor Co, up 12 percent.Edmunds also estimated gains for the top five automakers in U.S. sales, with GM up 10 percent, Ford up 15.5 percent, Toyota up 15.2 percent, Chrysler up 11 percent, and Honda up 12.6 percent.	-2.401118968
(Reuters) - Global auto sales for Japanese carmakers more than halved in April as the coronavirus pandemic forced governments to impose lockdowns that left streets empty and showrooms deserted.Japan’s top eight automakers together posted a decline of 54.4% in April sales, according to a Reuters calculation.Toyota Motor's 7203.T worldwide sales including units Daihatsu and Hino 7205.T fell 45% to 472,703 vehicles - the fourth straight month of declines. Toyota's performance was dragged down by a 51% slump in sales outside Japan.Japan’s largest automaker this month said it expected profit this year to drop by 80% to its lowest in nine years, underscoring the challenge that even the most profitable carmakers are having to contend with during the pandemic.Auto sales have slumped all around the world, including the two biggest markets, China and the United States.While China reported an upturn in April auto sales from a year earlier by virtue of pent up demand after weeks of lockdown, annual sales could still fall by 15-25%.Auto retail sales in the United States are likely to have halved in April, according to analytics firm J.D. Power. However, sales in May are expected to improve as most carmakers offer attractive incentives to boost demand as lockdowns ease.Honda Motor's 7267.T global April sales fell 43% and Nissan Motor 7201.T sold nearly 42% fewer cars than the same month last year.Nissan on Thursday posted its first annual loss in 11 years and unveiled a plan to become a smaller, more cost-efficient automaker.	0.6983572732
SYDNEY, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Japanese shares rose to their highest level in over a week on Friday as the safe-haven yen eased on hopes of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.Sentiment was also buoyed by a sharp jump in Seven &amp; I Holdings, the country’s largest convenience store operator, after it announced a massive restructuring plan.The benchmark Nikkei average ended up 1.2% at 21,798.87 points, its highest closing since Oct. 2. For the week, it was up 1.8%, its first gain in three weeks.The broader Topix added 0.9% to 1,595.27, also marking its highest close in 1-1/2-weeks.Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up a first day of trade talks in more than two months on Thursday, as business groups expressed optimism the two sides might be able to de-escalate a trade war and delay a U.S. tariff hike scheduled for next week.U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that his team had a “very, very good negotiation�� with China, and reiterated his plans to meet with Liu at the White House on Friday.Disruptions to global supply chains caused by the trade dispute, and the resulting drag on global demand, have weighed heavily on other export-reliant Asian economies such as Japan’s.Improved risk appetite pushed the safe-haven yen lower to 108.13 per dollar, its weakest since Oct. 1, provided a tailwind for Japanese exporters.Toyota Motor rose 2.3% and Mitsubishi Motor 2.2% gained, while Panasonic firmed 1.9%.As the retail sector’s June-August earnings season got under way in Japan, notable movers include Seven &amp; I Holdings and Fast Retailing.Seven &amp; I jumped 4.9% to its highest since late March after the convenience store operator announcing restructuring plans, including job cuts and store closures.Nikkei-heavyweight Fast Retailing Co climbed 2.6% as the operator of Uniqlo chain booked a record annual profit for a third consecutive year on strong sales in China and forecast further growth in the current business year through August.Bucking the trend, Yaskawa Electric Corp, a bellwether for manufacturing trends, dropped 0.7% after the motor and factory-robot maker slashed its full-year operating profit forecast.Despite rising optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks, traders are reluctant to take positions ahead of the conclusion of the latest negotiations and a long weekend, market players said.Financial markets in Japan will be closed on Monday for a public holiday.	7.396164952
(Reuters) - General Motors Co reclaimed its title as the world’s top selling automaker for the first time since 2007, after sales of more than 9 million vehicles globally in 2011.GM’s return to the top slot comes more than two years after its taxpayer-funded bankruptcy restructuring that allowed the Detroit-based automaker to cut its spiraling legacy costs.GM vaulted to the top spot last year for the first time since 2007. In 2008, GM’s global sales fell 11 percent, allowing Toyota Motor Co to overtake GM for the first time.In 2011, Toyota’s sales were hurt by severe production cuts following an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan as well as severe flooding in Thailand.In December, Toyota forecast global sales in 2011 would be 7.9 million. The Japanese automaker will publish a final sales tally later this month.That places Toyota in the No. 3 slot in 2011 worldwide sales, just behind Volkswagen AG , which sold 8.16 million vehicles last year.GM’s global figures includes its joint ventures in China.(Corrects to show GM last led in global auto sales in 2007, not 2008)	16.55462185
(Adds CEO comment, detail and background)BERLIN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s core brand suffered its first fall in sales in more than a decade last year and the carmaker said that markets will remain “challenging�� in 2016 as it battles to contain the damage from its emissions scandal.Deliveries of VW-branded vehicles fell 4.8 percent to 5.82 million cars on weakening demand in China and the United States and the effects of the company’s rigging of diesel emissions tests, the company said on Friday.The underperformance at VW’s largest division by sales and revenue pulled down annual group deliveries, including the Audi and Porsche premium brands, by 2 percent to 9.93 million cars, the first drop in 13 years, VW said.“We must handle the situation on world markets where trends remain mixed,�� Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said.Group sales in China, a stable source of revenue for VW for years and the carmaker’s biggest market, fell 3.4 percent to 3.55 million autos while deliveries in Europe were up 2.5 percent to 3.95 million, the Wolfsburg-based firm said.VW had briefly pulled ahead of global sales champion Toyota after six months, though slipped behind the Japanese rival in the second half of last year when the emissions scandal broke.Toyota and U.S. rival General Motors are expected to publish full-year auto sales later this month.

(Adds final sales total, paragraphs 4-5)DETROIT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - January U.S. car sales by the three Detroit-based automakers topped analysts�� expectations on Tuesday, as low gasoline prices and easy credit terms helped fuel sales of utility vehicles and big pickups.Full-size trucks and SUVs are among the industry’s most profitable vehicles. But some companies were having trouble supplying dealers with enough of those high-margin models in January.Sales of trucks and SUVs accounted for 69 percent of January sales at General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, compared with 66 percent a year ago, according to a Reuters analysis.Overall U.S. industry sales in January finished up 13.7 percent at 1.15 million vehicles, and the annual sales rate for the month was 16.66 million vehicles, according to research firm Autodata. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had estimated the annual rate would be 16.6 million.It was the highest rate for January since 2006, Autodata said.GM said that January sales rose 18 percent to 202,786 vehicles, while Ford said sales were up 15 percent to 178,351. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 201,436 and 173,431, respectively.Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. arm said January sales rose 14 percent to 145,007 vehicles, narrowly topping analysts�� expectations.“As the price of gasoline goes down, people want to buy bigger vehicles that go faster,�� said Mike Jackson, chief executive officer of AutoNation Inc. “That’s just human nature.”Ford sold a record 54,370 F-series pickups in January and said the redesigned 2015 F-150 remained in short supply, particularly high-end versions including the King Ranch and Platinum editions.GM said combined sales of its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups were up 22 percent to 48,727. Sales of the automaker’s new mid-size Colorado and Canyon pickups totaled 8,147.At Fiat Chrysler, Jeep sales climbed 23 percent and Ram trucks rose 21 percent.January sales topped expectations at Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, but lagged at Honda Motor Co.Toyota sales of 169,194 were up 16 percent, including record sales by its premium Lexus brand.Sales at Nissan jumped 15 percent to 104,107. Nissan’s performance was driven in part by strong results of its Rogue, Pathfinder and Murano utility vehicles, as well as its Versa, Sentra and Altima sedans.Honda said record January sales of 102,184 were up 12 percent from a year ago, narrowly missing analysts�� expectations. Sales of the Civic and Accord were down, but the best-selling CR-V crossover jumped 22 percent.

MUNICH/HAMBURG, June 27 (Reuters) - BMW and Toyota plan to expand a technological partnership, two sources close to the companies told Reuters, a deal that could prompt a shift in auto industry allegiances.The agreement will be extended to include hybrid powertrains and lightweight design, the sources said on Wednesday.BMW has primarily preferred France’s PSA Peugeot Citroen as a partner when it comes to reducing development and production costs.But the cash-strapped French have recently sought savings through an alliance with General Motors. By aligning more with Toyota, BMW would have a partner that offers greater scale than Peugeot and a financially healthy one at that.BMW will host a news conference at 1030 GMT on Friday to mark a visit from Toyota scion and chief executive Akio Toyoda to the German luxury carmaker’s Munich headquarters.The companies declined to comment on the conference’s subject matter, but the sources said Toyoda and BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer would explain their new ideas. The sources added, however, no contracts have been drafted for them to sign.Eager to bulk up its diesel engine line-up in a sagging European market, Toyota agreed to collaborate with BMW on lithium-ion battery research in exchange for a steady supply of BMW-made diesel engines starting in 2014.This time BMW looks to be the partner in need. Now that Peugeot is devoting resources to cementing an alliance with GM, the joint venture with Peugeot on hybrid parts looks shaky.BMW needs to reduce the carbon emissions of its new car fleet by roughly a third, to 101 grams per kilometre, by 2020, which Reithofer argues can only be achieved if it ramps up the number of hybrid and electric cars in its range.“I would bet that there will soon be BMW cars equipped with Toyota’s hybrid powertrains,�� one of the sources said.The Japanese carmaker could then gain access to the carbon fibre joint venture with SGL, which produces cutting-edge lightweight materials that BMW aims to use on an industrial scale to mass produce its Megacity electric car, dubbed the i3.	-3.293182983
SHANGHAI, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota, Honda and Nissan became the latest foreign carmakers to respond to China’s anti-monopoly investigation into the auto industry, as the probe’s impact extends beyond foreign luxury auto brands.GAC Toyota Motor Co, Toyota’s joint venture with China’s GAC Group, and Guangqi Honda Automobile Co, Honda’s venture with GAC, both said late on Friday they would cut spare part prices due to the investigation.Nissan’s joint venture with China’s Dongfeng Motor Group Co said it paid close attention to the regulator’s suggestions and was actively studying improvements.The moves came on the heels of price cuts by foreign luxury brands including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Chrysler and Jaguar Land Rover over the past month, as China’s price regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), steps up scrutiny of the industry.China has also wielded its anti-monopoly law against other industries, including milk power and software. It targeted multinationals Mead Johnson Nutrition Co and Danone SA , which the regulator slapped with hefty fines, as well as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, which faces the prospect of a $1 billion fine.China’s anti-trust investigations target monopolistic practices in general and aim to promote fair competition and protect consumer interests, China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement posted on the Ministry’s website.Both domestic and foreign firms must bear the due liabilities if they break the law, Shen said.Industry experts say automakers have too much leverage over car dealers and auto part suppliers, enabling them to control prices, considered as a violation of China’s anti-trust laws.China, the world’s biggest auto market, is dominated by foreign brands.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Thursday said it was recalling a total of about 2.9 million vehicles in Japan, China, Oceania and other regions including its Corolla Axio sedan and RAV4 SUV crossover due to potentially faulty airbag inflators.Fuji Heavy Industries 7270.T, the maker of Subaru cars, Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T and truck maker Hino Motors 7205.T also recalled a total of about 240,000 vehicles in the domestic market over inflators made by Takata Corp 7312.T which can explode after prolonged exposure to hot conditions.At least 16 deaths have been linked to exploding Takata inflators, mainly in the United States, prompting the auto industry’s biggest-ever global recall.Global transport authorities consider Takata inflators containing the chemical compound ammonium nitrate to be unsafe if used without a drying agent, and have ordered all of the about 100 million on the market to be withdrawn.The Japanese automakers said that the latest recalls were part of a wider recall of Takata inflators ordered by global transport authorities last year.Toyota said that recalls were issued for about 1.16 million vehicles sold in Oceania, the Middle East and the automaker’s smaller markets, nearly one-third of total, while about 750,000 vehicles had been recalled in Japan.Vehicles sold in North America, Toyota’s biggest market, were exempt from the latest recall, it added.Takata is currently seeking a financial sponsor to help pay for the costs related to the recalls. Last month, it pleaded guilty to a U.S. felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement over its faulty inflators.	-1.599127749
CHICAGO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s U.S. head said on Thursday that a problem with heated seats that has forced the company to halt sales of several vehicle models in the United States would weigh on the automaker’s February sales but he predicted the negative effect would be minor.Talking to reporters at the Chicago Auto Show, Bob Carter, the head of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc, said the sales halt - which was announced late last month and remains in place - affected about 30,000 vehicles on dealer lots and would have a “very minor impact�� on the company’s February U.S. sales.Carter did not rule out the possibility that the sales stop could be escalated to a recall, saying the issue was in the hands of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The stop-sale order, which includes some top-selling Camry and Corolla models, was triggered after Toyota learned that some of the fabrics used in the heated seats were not as flame resistant as required by law.“It’s a small percent of our current inventories,�� Carter said. “Those cars will start being repaired this week and it will take us a couple of weeks to get all the parts available.”Asked if he knew how many of the affected vehicles were in customer hands, Carter said: “I don’t know that right now.”Carter said that Toyota, which began exporting U.S.-made vehicles in 1988 and sent 130,000 of those vehicles overseas last year, expected to export a similar number of U.S.-made vehicles in 2014.	-3.441812915
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, and will tap Chinese battery makers to meet the accelerated global shift to electricity-powered cars.The change illustrates the breakneck growth in the electric vehicle (EV) market, which is transforming the auto industry, and is also an acknowledgment by Japan’s top car maker that it may not be able to meet demand for batteries on its own.Toyota is now faced with a higher-than-expected demand for cars that use batteries, rather than gasoline, Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told a briefing on Friday.Also, increasingly stringent emissions regulations require more lithium-ion batteries in the next five years than the automaker plans to produce, he added.“We consider ourselves as a maker of electric vehicle batteries, going back to when we developed the battery for the Prius,�� he said, referring to the pioneering gasoline hybrid.“But there may be a gap between the amount of batteries we can produce, and the amount of batteries we may need.”Toyota, which already makes batteries for hybrids and hybrid plug-ins, said it will partner with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) and EV maker BYD Co Ltd for battery procurement.It also announced an ultra-compact two-seater designed for short-distance trips, with a maximum speed of 60 km (37 miles) per hour and 100 km range on a single charge.However, Terashi said while demand for EVs grows, profits will be slower in coming, given the economies of scale.EV technology has come a long way since 2010, with battery technologies improving and costs coming down.Still, EV sales are expected to trail gasoline hybrid vehicle volumes by 2025, with the former expected to be fewer than 1 million vehicles, Terashi added.The key to creating a profitable battery EV operation could be in combining new mobility technologies, including on-demand ride services, with battery-powered electric cars, he said.Tapping CATL signals a widening of Toyota’s procurement pool. The Chinese firm already has relationships with other automakers such as Honda Motor, Nissan and a multi-billion dollar battery supply deal Volvo Car Group.Toyota has for decades been developing its own lithium-ion EV battery technology and has partnered with Panasonic to develop and make rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries.The automaker, which launched the Prius, the world’s first mass-market “green car�� over two decades ago, has led in technologies for hybrid and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Its cars account for more than 80% of the global hybrid vehicle market.But it has trailed rivals such as Nissan Motor, Volkswagen and Tesla in bringing all-battery EVs to showrooms.Toyota is looking to partnerships with rival automakers and tech firms as it seeks to reduce its capital outlay for developing new-vehicle technologies.On Thursday, it announced it was teaming with Subaru Corp to develop a battery-electric SUV on a platform produced together as they seek to split costs.Toyota is, however, not changing its long-held belief that hydrogen FCVs will be the ultimate zero-emissions vehicles in the future, Terashi said.“We haven’t changed our policy towards battery EVs,�� Terashi said. “We are not shifting our focus to prioritize battery EVs, nor are we abandoning our FCV strategy.”The firm has also long espoused the benefits of hybrids and how they are an effective alternative to all-battery EVs, given a fuel efficiency roughly double that of gasoline cars, lower cost and that they do not need charging infrastructure.	3.660429774

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials will have a new round of meetings with an automakers trade group and California’s “clean air�� agency next week before unveiling a proposal to reverse rules aimed at increasing fuel efficiency, participants said on Thursday.The rules, negotiated with automakers by President Barack Obama’s administration in 2011, aimed to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025 and included significant annual increases in automaker requirements.President Donald Trump administration’s proposed rule, expected to be made available for public comment later in June or July, will include a series of alternatives but the preferred alternative will be to freeze requirements at 2020 levels, officials said.The White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, part of the Office of Management and Budget, will meet separately on Tuesday with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The trade group represents General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and other major companies.Reuters on May 31 reported the U.S. Transportation Department had submitted a proposal to the White House for review along with the Environmental Protection Agency that would back freezing requirements at 2020 levels through 2026 and would bar California from setting stricter standards than the federal government.U.S. Senator Tom Carper has said a draft shows the administration’s preferred alternative would result in Americans using 206 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 versus the current standards.	-4.638833665
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Reuters) - Steinhoff has sold a majority stake in its South African auto dealerships unit, it said on Thursday, days after selling its stake in a local industrial group to shore up its finances following a devastating accounting fraud.Steinhoff revealed details earlier this month of the 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) fraud that has shocked investors and left the retail group scrambling for working capital.The company said it had reached an agreement to sell a 75 percent stake in Unitrans, which runs one of South Africa’s largest auto showrooms and a network of trucks dealerships with annual sales of more than 23 billion rand ($1.6 billion).Unitrans is being sold to French distribution company CFAO, part of Japanese conglomerate Toyota Tsusho Corp, Steinhoff said, without giving financial details of the deal.Steinhoff raised 4.8 billion rand from the sale of its 26 percent stake in KAP Industrial to pay off debt and bolster its finances.

KORIYAMA, Japan (Reuters) - The death toll in the worst typhoon to hit Japan for decades climbed to 66 on Tuesday as rescuers slogged through mud and debris in an increasingly grim search for the missing, and as thousands of homes remained without power or water.Fifteen people remain missing nearly three days after Typhoon Hagibis smashed into central and eastern Japan, national broadcaster NHK said. More than 200 people were injured in the storm, whose name means “speed�� in the Tagalog language.(Click tmsnrt.rs/31c0feP to see an interactive graphic plotting the path of Typhoon Hagibis)The highest toll was in Fukushima prefecture north of Tokyo, where levees burst in at least 14 places along the Abukuma River, which meanders through a number of cities in the largely agricultural prefecture. At least 25 people died in Fukushima, including a mother and child who were caught in flood waters, NHK said. Another child of the woman remains missing.Residents in Koriyama, one of Fukushima’s larger cities, said they were taken by surprise by the flooding. Police were searching house-to-house to make sure nobody had been left behind or was in need of help.“The river has never flooded like this before, and some houses have been completely swept away. I think it might be time to redraw hazard maps or reconsider evacuation plans,�� said Masaharu Ishizawa, a 26-year-old high school teacher who was cleaning up at his family home in Koriyama.He said there are a lot of elderly in his area and many of them were taken in by relatives.“We have never seen damage like this before, and maybe global warming and environmental change has something to do with it.”Part of his family’s back garden had been washed away, breaking water pipes and electricity lines. The family was using water carried from a local community centre to clean up. Two doors down, an old house had collapsed after the flood washed its foundations away.About 133,000 households were without water while 22,000 lacked electricity, well down on the hundreds of thousands initially left without power but a cause for concern in northern areas where temperatures are falling.Survivors described how water rose rapidly to chest height in about an hour and mainly at night, making it hard to escape to higher ground. Many of the dead in Fukushima were elderly, NHK said.“I checked the flood hazard map but it didn’t have my area as being at risk,�� said Yoshinagi Higuchi, 68, who lives about 100 metres from one levee and waited out the flood on the second floor of his house as the ground floor filled with water.“I heard there was a flood once before the war, but we just weren’t expecting the water to come over the levee despite all the warnings.”Residents were warned by the public address systems that are a feature of Japanese cities and some evacuated to a local elementary school, he added as he and neighbours piled sodden tatami straw mats and other damaged furniture on the street.“Nobody from city hall has come to check on us yet,�� Higuchi said.Fukushima is home to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Officials for Tokyo Electric Power Co 9501.T, which owns the plant, have said there was no leakage of contaminated water.Around the nation, manufacturers took stock. Electronics maker Panasonic Corp 6752.T said flooding had damaged its plant in a large industrial park in Koriyama.Automakers Nissan 7201.T, Honda 7267.T and Subaru 7270.T said there was no major damage to their factories, while Toyota 7203.T said all its plants were operating normally. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned that the economic impact could be prolonged.“The national government will continue to do everything possible so that the victims of this disaster can return to their normal lives as soon as possible,�� Abe told a parliamentary committee.Finance Minister Taro Aso said there was 500 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in reserves for disaster recovery and more money would be considered if needed.Thousands of police, fire officials and military personnel continued to search for people who may have been cut off by floodwaters and landslides, with hope diminishing that the missing would be found alive.Though the threat of rain is expected to diminish on Tuesday, temperatures are likely to drop in many areas later this week, in some cases to unseasonably low levels, NHK said.Four of Japan’s major refiners said there was no impact on their refinery operations from the storm.($1 = 108.3300 yen)	5.114342076
PRAGUE, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s and PSA Peugeot Citroen’s car factory in the Czech Republic increased its production by 8 percent to 219,054 vehicles in 2015, the company which operates the joint venture said on Thursday.The car industry is a major driver of the Czech economy, which achieved one of the European Union’s fastest growth rates last year, when it expanded by more than 4 percent.The joint venture, known as TPCA, makes the two car companies�� smaller models, such as the Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 108 and Citroen C1, and exports the majority of its vehicles to western Europe.Overall, car production in the Czech Republic is expected to have risen to a record of 1.3 million vehicles last year, an industry official said earlier on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans in the U.S. Congress said on Thursday that his administration’s national security investigation of car and truck imports amid a trade spat with China is being pursued under false pretenses and could hurt U.S. consumers.Trump said on Wednesday that ongoing U.S.-China trade talks would need “a different structure�� because they appeared “too hard to get done.”Shortly after, the Commerce Department launched a probe of auto imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March.Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, which count the United States as a key market. Congressional Republicans said it was unclear what Trump was aiming to accomplish with the probe, warning it could result in U.S. job losses, and with some suggesting it was a political tactic ahead of midterm elections in November.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said there was “no reason�� to conduct a national security investigation of auto imports.“This appears to be either an attempt to affect domestic politics ahead of the election or for some other transactional purpose regarding ongoing trade discussions. This is a dangerous course and should be abandoned immediately,�� Corker said in a statement.Corker is a Republican from Tennessee, where Volkswagen, Nissan and other auto-related manufacturers have assembly and production plants.Pennsylvania’s Republican Senator Pat Toomey said on Twitter that Trump was making the move “under the false pretense of national security�� and that it “invites retaliation.”In the House of Representatives, Kentucky Republican Andy Barr, who has a Toyota factory in his district, said he wants to know what Trump seeks to accomplish.“Toyota Kentucky is as much of an American manufacturing company as Ford in Louisville,�� Barr told Reuters. “It’s an American subsidiary of a Japanese parent, but it is an American company. There needs to be a level playing field.”Republican Representative Roger Williams, who owns a Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep auto dealership in Weatherford, Texas, said any tariff on auto imports would negate the positive impact of the new Republican tax law on consumers, and increase costs for U.S. car manufacturers that buy foreign parts.“They’re world vehicles. Parts are made everywhere and they’re put together somewhere,�� Williams told Reuters.Senator Orrin Hatch, the finance committee chairman who shepherded the tax law through that chamber, called the Trump investigation of auto imports “deeply misguided.”�For most Americans, cars are the second largest purchase they make, after their homes. Taxing cars, trucks and auto parts coming into the country would directly hit American families,�� Republican Hatch said in a statement, urging Trump to “remain focused on addressing China’s trade practices.”It was not yet clear whether lawmakers might try to act if the administration eventually imposes new tariffs on foreign auto imports.	-1.069559865

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N agreed to pay nearly $17.4 million in a settlement with U.S. auto safety regulators for failing to act quickly enough last year to recall vehicles with a defect that may cause unintended acceleration.Ford and regulators reached the settlement “in order to avoid a protracted dispute and possible litigation,�� according to the settlement document dated June 28. Ford paid the settlement on July 26, according to the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The NHTSA had asked Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, to recall nearly 424,000 Ford Escape sport-utility vehicles with a defect that caused a stuck throttle when the accelerator pedal was fully or almost fully depressed. The Escapes were from the 2001 to 2004 model years.During its investigation, Ford gave NHTSA information that supported “a tentative conclusion�� that the recall may not have been timely, according to the settlement document. That could be a violation of U.S. law.Ford denied that it broke the law. In a statement, Ford stressed that it was committed to responding quickly to potential vehicle issues. The settlement agreement does not release Ford from civil or criminal liabilities.“While we are confident in our current processes for quickly identifying and addressing potential vehicle issues, Ford agreed to this settlement to avoid a lengthy dispute with the government,�� the company said in a statement.The Wall Street Journal first reported the details of the Ford settlement, which is the largest settlement reached so far this year, according to NHTSA records.In December 2012, Toyota Motor Corp agreed to pay almost $17.4 million in a settlement over NHTSA claims that it did not recall 2010 Lexus RS 350s fast enough over an issue of floor mat pedal entrapment.Toyota has reached four separate settlements with NHTSA over the timing of its recalls. The payments exceeded $66 million from 2010 to 2013.	-7.466686518
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday that the average fuel efficiency of cars and trucks hit a record high in the 2017 model year, but highlighted in a report “legitimate concerns�� about the industry’s ability to meet rising annual requirements.For the 13 major automakers that sell vehicles in the United States, the average increase in fuel efficiency was a modest 0.2 miles per gallon (mpg) to 24.9 mpg from 24.7 mpg in 2016, in part because Americans were buying more large SUVs and pickups and fewer cars.EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said “there are legitimate concerns about the ability to cost-effectively achieve the Obama Administration’s standards in the near future�� and he noted that just three out of 13 major automakers met the 2017 requirements without using credits.Automakers earn credits for over-complying with fuel efficiency requirements and can save them for use in future years when they face tougher standards or sell them to competitors if they do not need them. Automakers worry that without significant changes, they will not be able to meet requirements after 2020 because many credits expire.The EPA report also shows that preliminary fuel efficiency for 2018 jumped by 0.5 mpg to 25.4 mpg.Luke Tonachel, director for clean vehicles and fuels at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the “data shows the current standards are working�� and suggests that automakers could adopt additional existing technologies to improve fuel efficiency.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major U.S. and foreign automakers, said they have invested billions of dollars to offer highly fuel efficient models but acknowledged that with low gas prices they are not selling as many as some forecast.“Market conditions are a critical reality since our compliance with federal standards is based on sales and affordability,�� it said.The report shows that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV bought a significant number of credits, while Honda Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla Inc sold credits. BMW AG, Jaguar Land Rover, Volkswagen AG, and Daimler AG also bought credits, the report said.Honda had the highest average fuel economy at 29.4 mpg, followed by Mazda Motor Co at 29 mpg and Hyundai Motor Co at 28.6 mpg.The U.S. automakers, which sell more trucks than their foreign competitors, were at the bottom of the list. Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co were at 22.9 mpg, ahead of only Fiat Chrysler at 21.2 mpg.Toyota, which ranks ninth out of the 13 automakers, was the only major automaker to see its fleet-wide average fall as it sold more SUVs and trucks and fewer cars.Fiat Chrysler disclosed last month it paid $77 million in U.S. civil penalties for failing to meet 2016 model year fuel economy requirements.In August 2018, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration unveiled a proposal to freeze fuel economy requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, a move it said would save automakers more than $300 billion in regulatory costs and reduce traffic deaths.The Obama administration had adopted rules calling for a nearly 5 percent annual increase in fuel efficiency requirements from 2021 through 2026.	4.264756056
SEOUL (Reuters) - Aiming to cash in on a major push by South Korea to promote fuel cell vehicles, Sung Won-young opened a hydrogen refueling station in the city of Ulsan last September. Just one year on, he’s thinking about closing it down.Sung's new hydrogen station is one of five in Ulsan, home to Hyundai Motor Co's 005380.KS main plants and roughly 1,100 fuel cell cars - the most of any South Korean city.The government paid the 3 billion won ($2.5 million) cost - six times more than fast charging equipment for battery electric cars - and the two pumps, located next to Sung’s gasoline stand, see a steady flow of Hyundai Nexo SUVs daily.Even so, Sung hasn’t been able to turn a profit, hamstrung as the equipment can only refuel a limited number of cars each day and by the government’s decision to set retail hydrogen prices low to bring consumers on board.“All hydrogen stations will have no choice but to shut down unless the government subsidizes operating costs,�� Sung, 32, told Reuters. “Otherwise, this place will just become a 3 billion won chunk of steel.”If those impediments to commercial viability were not enough, a fatal hydrogen storage tank explosion this year has spurred protests against the government and Hyundai’s ambitious campaign to promote the zero-emissions fuel.Calling hydrogen power the “future bread and butter�� of Asia’s No. 4 economy, President Moon Jae-in has declared himself an ambassador for the technology and targeted 850,000 fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) on South Korean roads by 2030.That’s no mean feat given fewer than 3,000 have been sold so far. Japan, also a big proponent of FCVs and with an auto market three times larger, plans 800,000 in the same timeframe.The challenges of building out refueling infrastructure in South Korea underscore the long and uphill battle FCVs face to widespread adoption at a time when electric cars are stealing much of the green car limelight.And for the government and Hyundai, the only automaker selling a fuel cell car in the country, it is an expensive project with no guarantee of success.Moon is set to spend $1.8 billion in central government funds to subsidize car sales and to build refueling stations for the five years to 2022 at current subsidy levels, Reuters calculations show.Subsidies cut Nexo's price by half to about 35 million won ($29,300) and sales of the model, launched in March 2018, have surged this year. In contrast, Japanese subsidies fund one third of Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Mirai FCV, bringing its price to around $46,200.Some critics argue Hyundai is the main beneficiary of the government’s ardent backing, but the automaker also has much at stake. With its suppliers, it plans to invest $6.5 billion by 2030 on hydrogen R&amp;D and facilities.“There are risks that come with the need to make large-scale investments in building (hydrogen car) production facilities, securing supply channels and establishing sales networks,�� Hyundai said in an e-mailed statement.(GRAPHIC: South Korea's push for a hydrogen economy - )In May, a hydrogen storage tank at a government research project in the rural city of Gangneung exploded. It destroyed a complex about half the size of a soccer field, killing two and injuring six. A preliminary investigation found the blast was caused by a spark after oxygen found its way into the tank.“One victim was blown away by pressure and then killed after being hit by rock,�� said Kong Gikwang, a lawyer who represents the family of one of the two who died in a lawsuit against the research complex.One month later, there was an explosion at a hydrogen refueling station in Norway. This week, a hydrogen gas leak and subsequent fire at a South Korean chemical plant caused three workers to suffer burns.Such safety concerns have fueled protests by South Korean resident groups worried about hydrogen facilities being built in their areas.Kim Jong-ho, who began a month-long hunger strike against a planned fuel cell power plant in the port city of Incheon two days before the Gangneung blast, said the explosion refocused attention from pollution risks of hydrogen production to safety. Incheon has since agreed to review the safety and environmental impact of the plant.Potential station operators have also gotten cold feet since the explosions.Pyeongtaek city in April picked two gasoline stand operators to run hydrogen stands but within three months, both decided to bow out, forcing the city to restart its search.“At first, I had great interest. But once I looked closely, I realized the government was pushing for something that can’t make profits,�� one of the prospective operators said, asking not to be identified.“And I couldn’t live worrying about whether there would be an explosion.”To counter such fears, the government is holding briefings for residents, while Hyundai said it is working to convince consumers of hydrogen’s safety with information promoted through Youtube and social media.‘VALLEY OF DEATH’Despite government plans for 114 hydrogen stations - key for the widespread adoption of FCVs - to be built by end-2019, only 29 have been completed. Difficulties in gaining funds from local governments or businesses meant to help shoulder half the costs, delays in finding sites and opposition from residents have also hobbled efforts.Those constructing the stations know they are in for a slog.“There will be a period of going through the valley of death,�� Yoo Jong-soo, CEO of a consortium which has been tasked with building 100 stations but which does not expect to make money until 2025, said in a June presentation.The consortium, which includes Hyundai, has also called on the government to subsidize operating costs for hydrogen stands. Such a move is under consideration, an industry ministry official told Reuters, declining to be identified as the plan has not been finalised.“This will only increase the burden for taxpayers who have to pay for the government’s hydrogen society splurge,�� said Ryu Yen-hwa, a former Hyundai Motor engineer and auto analyst who believes FCVs do not make commercial sense.Just last month, Moon’s administration announced it would more than double spending on the ‘hydrogen economy�� to over 500 billion won next year.That includes 359 billion won on FCVs and refueling stations, up 52% from this year and a huge leap from the 29.8 billion won spent in 2018.Hyundai, which touts the Nexo as an “air purifier on the road��, is banking on Seoul’s aggressive targets to help it achieve economies of scale and bring down costs.It aims to cut the cost of a hydrogen car before subsidies to 50 million won once annual FCV production reaches 35,000. It hopes to make 40,000 per year by 2022, compared with plans for 11,000 next year.In the meantime, however, the constraints around refueling and the limited number of stations are causing much frustration.Hydrogen stand operator Sung said while refueling itself takes about 5-7 minutes, the next driver must wait another 20 minutes before sufficient pressure builds in the storage tank to supply the hydrogen or the car’s tank will not be full.That means he can only service about 100 fuel cell cars a day, compared to up to 1,000 at his gasoline stand. Many drivers can also not be bothered to wait 20 minutes and leave without a full tank.Choi Gyu-ho, who bought his Nexo to take advantage of low fuel prices, also noted that a lack of stations elsewhere made it hard to leave Ulsan.“It is very inconvenient. I feel anxious when I drive out of the city,�� he said.($1 = 1,194 won)&lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^EXPLAINER-Why Asia’s biggest economies are backing hydrogen fuel cell carsFOCUS-Toyota banks on Olympic halo for the humble bus to keep hydrogen dream aliveGRAPHIC-South Korea's push for a hydrogen economy tmsnrt.rs/306wC2hGRAPHIC-South Korea's push for a hydrogen economy (interactive) tmsnrt.rs/308ntX2^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt;	1.215049041
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan tech start-up Sendy, which operates an app linking delivery drivers with customers, is embarking on a second round of fundraising to expand in East Africa, its chief operating officer said on Monday.Sendy, used by around 4,000 businesses and 50,000 individuals, was founded four years ago and has so far raised $3 million.“We will be doing a series B investment round hopefully before the end of the year,�� Malaika Judd told Reuters, without giving a target amount. “We don’t want to be a small family logistics business, we want to be a tech platform that can solve logistics challenges across the world.”Investors in Sendy, which says it has modeled itself on other logistics platforms such as Indonesia’s Go-jek, include local telecoms operator Safaricom, Toyota East Africa and Dutch investor DOB Equity.Judd attributed the interest from both local and overseas investors to Sendy’s role in forging transport solutions for firms engaged in retail or fast-moving consumer goods in a region with challenges ranging from bad roads to heavy traffic.“The problem of logistics is so large that everyone is looking at creating solutions to solve it,�� she said, adding the emergence of e-commerce would further boost demand for the services of firms like Sendy.Toyota told Reuters its use of Sendy had boosted efficiency.“The costs of delivering spare parts from one location to another, or to a customer, has dropped by as much as 35 percent,�� said Dennis Awori, the chairman of Toyota in East Africa.Sendy, which has four founders, employs 60 people, half of them in engineering.Judd said the most realistic exit for them would be an acquisition by another large logistics company, keen to modernize its operations.“If we cash out in five years I will be very happy,�� she said.	0.9890016199
KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Tsusho Corp has made an offer to purchase 51 percent of Malaysia’s Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, bidding more on a per share basis than a rival Malaysian firm and sending Kian Joo’s stock soaring.The trading arm of the Toyota Group is offering 3.74 ringgit per share for the stake in the aluminium can maker, valuing the deal at some 847.3 million ringgit ($258 million).That represents a 13 percent premium to a 3.30 ringgit per share offer from Aspire Insight Sdn Bhd, a local private company. In contrast to Toyota Tsusho, Aspire wants to take over Kian Joo in a deal worth 1.46 billion ringgit.Kian Joo’s shares jumped 7 percent to 3.44 ringgit in early trade.Toyota Tsusho has reserved the right to re-calculate the offer since it has not yet conducted due diligence, according to Kian Joo’s local stock exchange filing.Kian Joo’s major shareholders include fellow canning company Can-One Bhd.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T opened the door to a bidding war among Midwestern and southern states seeking to land jobs and investment when it announced on Friday it would build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant with Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T. Toyota North America chief Jim Lentz told Reuters in an interview the automaker has not started searching for sites for the plant, expected to employ 4,000 workers, but would locate the factory near Toyota’s existing supply chain.Toyota has 10 U.S. plants in eight states in an arc that runs from West Virginia through Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas.For Toyota, the investment is a push to expand U.S. vehicle-making capacity and market share and intensify its attack on the Detroit automakers�� lucrative truck business.The announcement also comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs to curb auto imports and is working with Republican officials to woo investment in domestic production.States covet auto assembly plants because they typically pay above-average wages and spin off jobs at suppliers and service companies.Southern states have advantages including rail and highway infrastructure, proximity to major ports and business-friendly labor and regulatory environments, said Foster Finley, head of consulting firm AlixPartners operations practice.Midwestern states such as Ohio or Michigan can counter those strengths with incentives such as tax breaks or publicly funded worker training programs.“All of it boils down to an economic arrangement,�� he said.Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said in a statement on Friday that legislation approved last week to reduce taxes on business investment “is likely something that would make Michigan competitive over other states for this project.”The Toyota announcement came after Wisconsin last week said it will award Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn a record $3 billion in refundable tax incentives to build a $10 billion LCD panel factory that will initially employ 3,000 people.Still, Finley cautioned that the knock-on economic benefits of the new auto plant may be limited as much of the value of vehicles built there will likely still come from parts made in Mexico or Asia.For a factbox on U.S. auto subsidies, see:Toyota has already invested $23.4 billion in its U.S. operations, and has planned another $11.6 billion in investment over the next five years, fueled by robust profits.Trump earlier this year warned Toyota it would be subject to tariffs if it imported Corolla small cars from a factory planned in Mexico.Lentz said he could not say what impact Trump’s comments had on a decision that was under consideration for some time with Mazda because it was a decision made by executives at both car companies in Japan.“We understand the direction that we are getting from the administration and that is to build more in the U.S.,�� Lentz said. “Pressure from the White House would be the wrong word.”Under its new plan, Toyota’s forthcoming factory in Guanajuato, Mexico will not build Corollas that are currently assembled in Canada and instead build the medium-sized Tacoma pickup. It will continue to build Corollas in Mississipi as well.Lentz said the shift will allow Toyota to build more pickup trucks overall by adding more Tundra production in Texas and shifting Tacoma production to Mexico.“This is the fastest way to additional pickup truck supply,�� Lentz said, saying he expected to boost truck capacity by late 2019 or early 2020. That will help Toyota compete for a bigger share of the U.S. truck market, which has benefited from a shift in consumer tastes towards larger vehicles.Toyota’s U.S. Corolla sales are down nearly 9 percent this year.States will be competing to add a plant in a market that is already awash with production capacity and experiencing a slowdown in domestic auto sales.Toyota, along with German and Asian automakers, have during the past 30 years built a second auto industry in the United States, rivaling the U.S. operations of the Detroit Three automakers in size and employment, but with newer, and far less unionized, plants.The Detroit Three closed several U.S. factories during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. But since then U.S. automaking capacity has grown.Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE opened the last new U.S. assembly plant in 2011 in Tennessee to build new cars after getting nearly $600 million in tax incentives. But the automaker in 2013 opted to build a plant for its luxury Audi unit in Mexico instead of in the United States.Volvo Cars, a Swedish brand owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd [0175.HK] [GEELY.UL] will open a $500 million U.S. assembly plant next year in South Carolina.U.S. auto plants produced about 12 million vehicles, with capacity utilization in 2016 at 94 percent. Overall U.S. capacity is expected to grow by nearly 11 percent between 2016 and 2023, from about 12.5 million to just over 14 million, according to LMC Automotive.U.S. auto sales have weakened so far this year, and already two U.S. factories operated by General Motors Co GM.N have indefinitely laid off work shifts, while others have scaled back production.	-0.4468588452

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said on Wednesday it would stop producing vehicles in Indonesia, consolidating its global production in the face of falling sales which have pummeled its profitability.The decision to stop production at the West Java plant, which made its struggling Datsun compact cars, was part of a plan for “rightsizing, production optimization and reorganizing of business operations,�� Japan’s No. 2 automaker said in a statement.Nissan has warned that production cuts, which would result in plant closures, would be needed to accelerate cost-cutting and rebuild profits. The 86-year-old Japanese giant posted its first quarterly net loss in nearly a decade last month and slashed its annual profit forecast.Years of heavy discounting on its vehicles to grow market share tarnished the brand’s image and sent sales into a freefall, and pressure is mounting on Nissan and its new CEO Makoto Uchida to deliver a sustainable recovery plan in May.The automaker has been in turmoil since the arrest and sacking of long-time leader Carlos Ghosn in late 2018, and is trying to rebuild its partnership with France's Renault REN.PA.Nissan suggested it could leverage partner Mitsubishi Motor Corp's 7211.T plants to maintain a carmaking presence in Indonesia, but the move to end its own production opens the door for rivals Toyota Motor Co 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T to build on their dominance in the country.Market leader Toyota operates two plants in Indonesia, producing Toyota branded vehicles and Daihatsu compact cars which together have a market share of more than 40% of the country’s auto sales. Honda also produces cars and motorcycles in the country.Nissan’s exit could also benefit South Korea’s Hyundai, which announced late last year it would build a new factory in Indonesia, its first car plant in Southeast Asia as the South Korean automaker plans to take on its Japanese rivals in the region.	2.943415377

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Despite the yen’s recent retreat from record highs against the dollar it remains at a level that is driving Japanese automakers to shift production outside their home base and to North America in particular, industry executives said this week.The currency’s strength has eaten into automakers�� margins and made it more costly to build vehicles at factories in Japan.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T is planning to move output of its Infiniti brand outside Japan, likely to North America or China, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on the sidelines of the New York auto show on Wednesday. He called the yen's strength a ""major handicap"" for the luxury nameplate.Toyota Motor Co's 7203.T youth brand Scion has also started to explore the option of building cars at one of Toyota's U.S. assembly plants and is aiming to boost U.S.-made components, an executive said.“It pushes our whole engineering team to look at every item even closer because of the yen situation,�� said Jack Hollis, head of the Scion brand, while adding it was “nowhere near a decision point�� on its production plans.One dollar bought 82.36 yen in Wednesday trading, having bounced off a record low at 75.31 plumbed last October.Japanese authorities have intervened to weaken the currency, worried the yen’s strength could sap exports and slow Japan’s economic recovery from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.A soaring yen makes it cheaper to buy commodities and overseas assets, but it also diminishes earnings from major auto markets such as the United States.That has made things difficult for Infiniti, which is a long way off from meeting Ghosn’s goal of making up 10 percent of global luxury sales.“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where you’re producing in a country with a strong currency and selling in country where the currency is much weaker,�� Ghosn told reporters.Ghosn said he expected sales of the Leaf electric car would jump after the company moves output of the vehicle to Tennessee this summer. Nissan says the yen has made it difficult to build enough Leafs to sate demand.CUTTING OFF THE ‘COROLLA BRIDGE’�The dollar yen has obviously been a challenge for the company,�� said Toyota’s U.S. sales chief Bob Carter, whose company imports some Toyota Corolla cars from Japan across what Carter calls a ‘Corolla bridge.’A second shift at a Toyota plant in Mississippi is coming online, Carter said, and the company is working to boost the portion of North American parts on its vehicles.“Companywide, about 70 pct of our production is built in North America,�� Carter said. “That’s going higher now that Mississippi is building Corolla, cutting off the Corolla bridge, so that will be approaching 80 pct (this year).”Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T is building an assembly plant in Mexico that will be operational in 2014, said Jim O'Sullivan, President and CEO of Mazda's North American operations, which import some vehicles from Japan.“The exchange rate has put pressure on everybody,�� O’Sullivan said. “It does create stress in the system.”Mazda also confirmed last month it was offering buyouts to U.S. white collar employees, without specifying how many jobs it expected to cut as a result.Honda, too, is expanding production in Mexico. The carmaker, which started making cars in Ohio in 1982, says 85 percent of its North American volumes are sourced from North American factories.“Once we have that factory, probably our ratio will be higher,�� American Honda CEO Tetssuo Iwamura said."	-6.165036966

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Wednesday said it will cut production of finished vehicles by 40 percent in Japan in May as demand shrinks around the world because of the coronavirus pandemic.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Shares of the Big Three Detroit automakers rose on Friday despite lackluster August sales, with investors focusing on a likely surge in demand as residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast replace flood-damaged cars and trucks.Overall U.S. car and light truck sales fell in August to a seasonally adjusted annual selling pace of 16.03 million vehicles, according to WardsAuto, down from a 17.13 million vehicle pace a year ago. U.S. auto sales have been slowing for much of the year.Still, analysts focused on the potential for Detroit automakers to cut inventories and stabilize used vehicle prices as Gulf Coast residents must replace tens of thousands of vehicles ruined by flood damage. Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas last week and the storm caused historic flooding in Houston, the fourth largest city in the United States.Ford sales fell 2.1 percent in August. Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co’s U.S. sales chief, told analysts that following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 “we saw a very dramatic snapback�� in demand.It was not clear how many vehicles in the Houston area will be scrapped, LaNeve said, saying he had seen estimates ranging from 200,000 to 400,000 to 1 million. Ford’s Houston dealers may have lost fewer than 5,000 vehicles, he said.Ford is the No. 1 automaker in the Houston market with 18 percent share, according to IHS Markit. The company plans to ship used vehicles to Houston dealers, and has “every indication we would have to add some production�� of new vehicles to meet demand, LaNeve said.Investor concerns about inventories of unsold vehicles and falling used car prices have weighed on Detroit automakers�� shares most of this year. Now, automakers can anticipate a jolt of demand from a big market that is a stronghold for Detroit brand trucks and SUVs.“It’s got to be a positive for the industry,�� LaNeve said.Investors appeared to agree. General Motors Co shares rose as much as 3.3 percent to their highest since early March, and were trading up 2.9 percent ahead of the close at $37.60. Ford was up 3.3 percent at $11.39 and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV ��s U.S.-traded shares were up nearly 5.2 percent $15.90, hitting their highest in more than five years.The Detroit automakers posted mixed August U.S. sales, with GM up 7.5 percent and Ford and Fiat Chrysler down. Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp improved sales by nearly 7 percent, Honda Motor Co’s sales fell 2.4 percent.GM got a lift from robust sales of crossovers across its four brands. The largest U.S. automaker by sales plans to move used vehicles into Houston, and expressed confidence it can reduce inventories to 850,000 or fewer vehicles by year end.Big auto dealership chains also intend to move vehicles to Houston from other markets as residents get insurance checks for drowned cars.“Hurricane Harvey did have an adverse effect on deliveries during the last week of August for every automaker but the key U.S. economic fundamentals remain supportive of strong vehicle sales,�� GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a statement.Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. vehicle sales fell 11 percent to 176,033 units. The company partly citing a planned 23 percent cut in sales to rental car companies.U.S. consumers kept migrating toward sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Toyota sold more than 43,000 redesigned RAV4 compact SUVs, up nearly 26 percent from a year ago. The RAV4 has displaced the Camry sedan as Toyota’s best-selling vehicle year to date.	5.007921141

TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it had reached an agreement with Denso Corp, its main supplier, to consolidate all core electronics component operations of both companies within Denso.Japan’s largest automaker said it would hold talks with Denso to discuss transferring production of electronics components made at its Hirose plant, near Toyota’s global headquarters, around the end of 2019.Denso, one of the world’s largest auto components suppliers, would take over mass production of electronics components used in Toyota’s vehicles from 2022, the automaker said.	-4.728924635
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said a new venture would be investing more than $2.8 billion to develop automated-driving software - the latest salvo in an increasingly frenetic battle to be ahead in a sector hit by a slew of disruptive technologies.The Tokyo-based venture, which will bring together some 1,000 employees including new hires, will be 90 percent held by Toyota with group suppliers Denso Corp and Aisin Seiki Co each taking 5 percent.“This company’s mission is to accelerate software development in a more effective and disruptive way, by augmenting the Toyota Group’s capability through the hiring of world-class software engineers,�� James Kuffner, who will lead the venture, said in a statement.The establishment of the new venture, Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development, comes as firms such as Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and Tesla Inc give traditional automakers a run for their money in building self-driving and electric cars.English is set to be the main business language of the new venture, the statement said.Toyota is also investing $1 billion in artificial intelligence and other technologies through its U.S.-based Toyota Research Institute, and has struck up technology partnerships with Microsoft Corp and Uber Technologies.Last month, Toyota Research Institute’s venture capital unit said it was co-leading an $11.5-million seed investment in May Mobility, an Ann Arbor-based startup that is developing self-driving shuttles for college campuses, central business districts and similar low-speed applications.	-3.351656741
BERLIN (Reuters) - A tug-of-war between Mexico and Tennessee over incentives is delaying Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE decision on where to build a make-or-break vehicle in North America, sources said, delaying the German group's efforts to fix its ailing U.S. business.Last week, the state of Tennessee reopened talks with VW on tax breaks and infrastructure to lure the firm to build a midsize crossover at its Chattanooga plant, after a pitch by Mexican authorities, sources told Reuters on Monday.Level-pegging between Chattanooga and Mexico means it could take at least until the end of June for VW to pick a production venue, either its $1 billion Chattanooga plant or a site in Mexico, two sources familiar with the matter said.VW had initially hoped to take the decision by now, sources said. It announced the crossover - combining features of a car and a sport utility vehicle - at the Detroit auto show in January as part of a $7 billion investment package for North America.“VW is taking way too long again to tackle another pressing U.S. problem,�� said Arndt Ellinghorst, London-based analyst at ISI Group. “The crossover will be a gainful addition to their portfolio, VW has got no time to waste.”Following a 2011-12 sales surge, U.S. deliveries of VW’s core passenger car brand slumped 7 percent last year and were 10 percent down in the January-April period this year at 118,154 vehicles, even as the world’s No. 2 auto market kept growing.Given typical development cycles, the crossover might not go on sale in the United States until 2016, five years after VW launched its locally-made midsize Passat saloon.Analysts have long urged VW to expand its U.S. lineup, especially on SUVs where offerings are confined to the compact Tiguan and the mid-size Touareg, which at $44,570 is almost 10 percent more expensive than the premium Lexus RX from Toyota.The German group, seeking to almost double sales of VW-badged vehicles to 800,000 by 2018, hopes to eclipse Toyota 7203.T as the world's biggest carmaker.Tennessee had offered the German manufacturer a $300 million package of incentives to assign the vehicle to its only U.S. plant. But state governor Bill Haslam withdrew the offer amid a February vote by factory workers on unionization.Sources gave no information about details of incentives discussed between VW and Tennessee officials, but said the state needed to top a package already pledged by authorities in Mexico.VW confirmed that incentive talks with Tennessee were under way, declining to elaborate.VW recently spent $700 million to upgrade its Mexican plant in Puebla for assembly of the revamped Golf hatchback, which started in January. The plant employs about 15,000 workers who also assemble the Jetta and Beetle models.A decision to manufacture the crossover in Puebla would be a surprise as VW’s management has all along preferred its Tennessee plant over the 50-year-old factory, sources said.Assigning the model to Chattanooga would be good news for a site where dwindling demand for the Passat last year caused VW to cut about 500 jobs.One of the sources said it was also conceivable that VW might give the nod to a new factory built by its luxury division Audi in San Jose Chiapa, about 35 miles from its aging Puebla facility. The Audi plant will be designed to assemble the Q5 SUV from 2016.Audi declined to comment.	5.925861469
TOKYO, March 23 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will ramp up production in Japan by about 10 percent in April-September as recent yen falls boost exports, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Saturday.The automaker will produce about 2.5 million vehicles in Japan in April-September, up 200,000 from the initial plan, the Japanese daily said.The recent weakening of the yen has helped improve exports, mainly to the United States and the Middle East, the paper said, adding that annual domestic output for 2013 may also be revised up from the current plan of 3.1 million vehicles.Toyota could not be immediately reached for comment.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive fiscal and monetary expansion campaign to revive the world’s third largest economy has sparked a fall in the yen, making major exporters like Toyota more competitive.

* Five faults in parts ranging from steering to seats in 29 models* Toyota gives no cost estimate for recall* Recall is second largest by Toyota to date (Adds U.S. analyst comments on recalls)TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, in its second-largest recall announcement, said on Wednesday that it would call back 6.39 million vehicles globally, and analysts saw automakers increasingly turning to recalls rather than risk bad publicity or legal costs.Rival General Motors Co is in the midst of its own recall of 2.6 million cars related to an ignition switch problem, which has been linked to at least 13 deaths.Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker said, it was not aware of any crashes or injuries caused by the glitches, which were found in 27 Toyota models including the RAV4 and Yaris subcompact. It uncovered five different faults involving parts ranging from steering to seats.Toyota said problems were also found in the Pontiac Vibe and the Subaru Trezia, two models the automaker built for General Motors and Fuji Heavy Industries.The automaker did not say now much the recalls would cost, and it was not clear if the faults stemmed from Toyota’s suppliers or its manufacturing process.The move by Toyota to announce five different recalls on a single day from Tokyo comes as major automakers face increasing scrutiny in the United States on how quickly they take preventive safety action and how quickly they share information with regulators and the public.Toyota agreed last month to pay $1.2 billion to the U.S. government for withholding information related to unintended acceleration in its vehicles. That safety crisis had caused Toyota to recall more than 9 million vehicles.“The negative publicity is causing automakers to react faster,�� said Dennis Virag, president of the Automotive Consulting Group. “The harm done to Toyota and GM is significant. Others don’t want to suffer the same fate.”For a graphic of U.S recalls see: (link.reuters.com/qyg48v)General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra was grilled by Congress last week on her company’s late response to the ignition switch issue.Morningstar analyst David Whiston said that costs of recalls can pale in comparison to potential fines and other legal costs.“The latest Toyota recall is a preventative measure. There have been no fatalities, but recalling the vehicles now will not lead to months of headlines, congressional hearings and fines from the Department of Justice,�� he said.In the largest of the recalls announced on Wednesday, Toyota said some 3.5 million vehicles were being recalled to replace a spiral cable that could be damaged when the steering wheel is turned. That could cause the air bag to fail in the event of a crash, the automaker said.In total, about 2.34 million of the vehicles to be recalled were sold in North America. Another 810,000 were sold in Europe.In the second-largest of the Toyota recalls, some 2.32 million three-door models made between January 2005 and August 2010 are being recalled to check for a fault in the seat rails that could cause the seat to slide forward in a crash, risking injury for the driver or passengers.The other recalls are for faulty steering column brackets, windshield wiper motors and engine starters.The recall announcement, which came during late afternoon Tokyo trade, knocked an additional 2 percent off Toyota’s already sagging shares.They quickly pared the extra losses, however, and ended down 3 percent at 5,450 yen, reflecting an overall weak tone in the market where the benchmark Nikkei average fell 2.1 percent.Toyota’s 6.39 million vehicle recall is the largest announced on a single day for the company since October 2012, when it called back 7.43 million Yaris, Corolla and other models to fix faulty power window switches.In the first two months of 2014, major automakers had announced 18 separate recalls in the United States, now the second-largest auto market behind China, according to the latest data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The recent wave of large-scale recalls represents a source of revenue for auto dealers who are paid by manufacturers to service defective cars.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday posted its largest quarterly operating profit in four years and raised its 2012 global sales target on the strength of demand for cars like the Camry and Prius in key markets such as the United States and Japan.The world’s top automaker reported an operating profit of 353 billion yen ($4.51 billion), from a loss a year ago, a better-than-expected result that underscored its rebound from the natural disasters that blighted 2011.Toyota, which regained its crown as the world’s best-selling automaker in the first half of 2012, said it now expects to sell 9.76 million cars and light trucks globally in 2012, including the Daihatsu and Hino brands. That was up almost 2 percent from its previous forecast.The stronger-than-expected performance by Toyota contrasted with its closest Japanese rivals Honda 7267.T and Nissan 7201.T.“This was a good result with a boost from good demand in Japan and a lift from recovery in the U.S. market,�� said Koji Endo, managing director of Advanced Research Japan. “In addition to the raising their sales forecast, they saw a contribution from their cost-streamlining efforts.”Toyota’s profit for the quarter ending in June was higher than the average estimate of 314.1 billion yen based on eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Toyota raised its 2012 output target for Toyota and Lexus to 8.87 million vehicles, an upward revision of 2.5 percent that shows the strength of its core brands.But it retained its operating profit forecast for this financial year at 1 trillion yen, citing economic risks from the European debt crisis.The results mark the strongest showing for Toyota yet under Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the company’s founder, who took over as president in 2009 just as the company was sliding into crisis.Toyoda, a driving enthusiast, is credited with having rallied morale among dealers, suppliers and employees after damaging and costly recall campaigns for 19 million vehicles and the lost production that followed a massive earthquake in Japan and flooding in Thailand in 2011.But analysts and investors have questioned the cost of Toyota’s commitment to keep making 3 million vehicles per year in Japan because the strong yen saps the profitability of exporting those cars, including the Prius.Even after raising its global output target, Toyota still manufactures nearly 40 percent of its vehicles in Japan, compared with about 25 percent for Nissan and Honda.“I want to see the company managed in a way that reduces its dependence on exports,�� BNP Paribas senior analyst Koichi Sugimoto said.“It has been more insistent about maintaining a certain level of production within Japan and as a result, it is handcuffing itself on decisions such as developing next-generation vehicles or making new investments.”In its single biggest and most profitable market, the United States, Toyota sales have snapped higher by 28 percent through July, the biggest gain for any major automaker.The U.S. sales gains have been combined with higher transaction prices, reflecting strong demand for the Prius and the Camry sedan, the top-selling car in the United States.Toyota said it now expects to sell 2.38 million vehicles in North America in the financial year, an upward revision of just over 1 percent to its earlier forecast.Despite its rebound, Toyota executives said the company was determined to manage its growth more carefully under Toyoda than it had in the boom years before 2008. Executives have said Toyota lost its focus on quality and came to underestimate the company’s reliance on a weak yen in pursuing growth.“Unless we operate based on a solid recognition that growing our business means new risks, we are at risk of going down the same path as before,�� Toyota senior managing officer Takahiko Ijichi told reporters.Both Nissan and Honda, which released their quarterly earnings in late July, underperformed analyst expectations, citing the drag from the strong yen and costly sales incentives as they tried to shift older models before putting revamped models on sale.Shares in Toyota have fallen nearly 15 percent in the financial year that began in April. On Friday, they ended at 3,065 yen, up less than 1 percent but outperforming the wider market .N225, which fell more than 1 percent.($1 = 78.2150 Japanese yen)	-2.874414014
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T on Thursday recalled close to 5 million vehicles fitted with potentially faulty Takata Corp 7312.T air bag inflators, as investigations showed the problem behind one of the biggest auto safety crises may be more widespread than thought.The latest move by Japan's third largest automaker brings the overall global total of vehicles recalled for Takata-related air bags to around 36 million since 2008, and comes a day after Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T recalled 6.5 million vehicles worldwide.Daihatsu Motors Co Ltd 7262.T said it recalled nearly 260,000 cars.Honda said it decided to recall the cars after finding some Takata bag inflators were not sealed properly, allowing moisture to seep into the propellent casing that could make the air bag explode with excessive force, shooting shrapnel inside the vehicle.Six deaths have been linked to defective air bags, all on cars made by Honda, which has borne the brunt of the Takata recalls to date, and which posted disappointing profit forecasts last month citing high quality-related costs.Automakers have been conducting their own investigations into Takata air bags.Most of Takata’s previous recalls were to replace air bags made at factories in the United States and Mexico where moisture got into the casing, the company and automakers have said.“While we are not able to determine the cause of the problems there is a possibility there will be more recalls,�� said Honda spokesman Teruhiko Tatebe.Honda, Toyota and Nissan said the recalls were precautionary, and there were no reports of accidents or injuries.Asked about the latest recalls, a Takata spokesman said the company would continue to cooperate with the automakers.Takata Chief Financial Officer Yoichiro Nomura told analysts on Thursday that the company, which has boosted production to supply replacement inflators, had “no plans for now�� to set aside more cash for the latest recalls, the spokesman added.Honda said it would use replacement parts supplied by Takata rivals Autoliv ALV.N and Daicel Corp 4202.T, as well as by Takata itself. It said the recall, which includes its Fit subcompact, did not affect any vehicles in the United States - where most of its previous recalls have been.The total Takata-linked recalls top the largest U.S. recall of 21 million vehicles by Ford Motor Co F.N in the 1980s for aparking gear problem, according to U.S. safety regulators andsafety advocates.Takata faces multiple class-action lawsuits in the UnitedStates and Canada, as well as a U.S. criminal investigation and regulatory probe.It has said it expects to return to profit this financial year even though it made few provisions for costs related to the recall.	-1.768756796

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery “in a few years�� that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently.“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,�� Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday.Improving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics.Producers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020.Using techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in “real time�� how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said.This should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said.	1.349745331
(The following statement was released by the rating agency)Feb 27 -Summary analysis -- Denso Corp. 27-Feb-2012CREDIT RATING: AA-/Negative/A-1+ Country: JapanPrimary SIC: Motor vehicleparts andaccessoriesMult. CUSIP6: 24872BCredit Rating History:Local currency Foreign currency04-Mar-2011 AA-/A-1+ AA-/A-1+06-Feb-2009 AA/A-1+ AA/A-1+RationaleThe ratings on Denso Corp. (AA-/Negative/A-1+) are based on the stand-alone credit profile (SACP) on the company, which we assess at ‘aa-��. At present, the ratings on Denso do not benefit from the incorporation of the possibility of extraordinary support as a consequence of its close relationship with Toyota Motor Corp. (AA-/Negative/A-1+), Denso’s largest shareholder and customer, only because Denso’s SACP is at the same level as that on Toyota Motor.The company’s strong position in high-value-added auto components, the benefits it derives from its ties to Toyota Motor, its good geographic and product diversity, and its minimal financial risk profile underpin Denso’s SACP. These strengths are partially offset by the company’s exposure to persistent pricing pressure from automakers, fluctuations in raw material prices, and intense global competition among auto component suppliers.As one of the world’s leading auto component suppliers, Denso has the technological competitiveness to offer high-value-added and high-quality products. Close ties with Toyota Motor provide the company with a variety of benefits in our opinion and have typically helped it generate steady earnings. Other benefits that the company enjoys from its close ties with Toyota include economies of scale derived from Toyota’s large production volume and opportunities to strengthen its technology, product quality, and cost position through joint product development and cost-cutting activities with Toyota.Denso’s customer diversity is somewhat limited compared with that of rival Robert Bosch GmbH (AA-/Stable/A-1+), since Denso generates roughly 50% of its sales from business with Toyota Motor. Still, in our opinion, its customer diversity is superior to that of many global auto suppliers and can be viewed as fair, given that the company has a good track record of supplying auto parts to major Japanese and non-Japanese automakers. In addition, Denso generates about 50% of its sales in overseas markets. This geographical diversification also supports the company’s competitive position.After posting weak financial results in fiscal 2008 (ended March 31, 2009) due to weak vehicle sales and production cuts at Toyota Motor and other automakers, Denso demonstrated a clear and rapid recovery in its operational and financial performance over the past two years. In fiscal 2010, Denso’s EBIT margin rose to 6%, from 4.6% in fiscal 2009 and minus 1.2% in fiscal 2008, owing to drastic reductions in fixed costs and recovering vehicle production.For fiscal 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the flooding in Thailand likely stalled Denso’s earnings recovery due to significant production cuts at many Japanese automakers, including Toyota. Moreover, Denso remains exposed to a strong yen and high raw material costs. However, we also believe that the company’s strong competitive position in non-Toyota businesses partially offset the negative impact from production cuts at Toyota and helped it withstand temporary pressure on its performance. We also believe a recovery at Japanese automakers should help Denso’s profitability to resume recovering. We assume Denso is likely to improve its operating margin to 6% or more in fiscal 2012.Denso’s financial profile has recovered significantly over the past two years. The company generated substantial free operating cash flow of JPY230 billion in fiscal 2009 and JPY252 billion in fiscal 2010. The ratio of funds from operations to adjusted total debt remained strong at about 80%, after significantly improving to 87% in fiscal 2009 from 30% in fiscal 2008. If we adjust for surplus cash, the ratio would be even stronger, exceeding 400% in fiscal 2010. Denso has accumulated historically high levels of surplus cash in response to unstable financial markets following the global financial crisis. The company’s net cash position stood high at JPY417 billion as of Dec. 31, 2011. Although we anticipate weaker financial performance in fiscal 2011, we believe Denso will maintain a minimal financial risk profile. We expect FFO to adjusted total debt to continue to exceed 60%.The ratings on Denso currently do not incorporate the possibility of extraordinary support from Toyota Motor. This is only because the SACP on Denso is currently at the same level as that on Toyota. We continue to see Denso having high strategic importance to Toyota Motor and sharing a strong relationship with the company.LiquidityWe view Denso’s liquidity as “strong�� as defined in our criteria, with sources of liquidity likely to exceed 1.5x uses over the next two years. As of Dec. 31, 2011, Denso’s cash and marketable securities totaled JPY965 billion, significantly in excess of the company’s total debt of JPY548 billion--JPY50 billion of which is long-term debt due within a year, and JPY37 billion of which is short-term debt from mainly Japanese banks with, in our view, low refinancing risk. Denso also maintains good relationships with its banks and should continue to enjoy access to capital markets given its strong credit quality. In addition, the high quality of the company’s trade receivables, due to Toyota being its largest customer, also supports its financial flexibility.OutlookThe outlook on Denso is negative, reflecting our view of the potentially adverse rating implications of the negative outlook on Toyota Motor. We may lower the ratings on Denso if we lower the ratings on Toyota Motor, as this could negatively affect the company’s business profile. On the other hand, we may revise the outlook back to stable if we revise the outlook on Toyota Motor to stable.	1.665682221
BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. F.N and its local partners boosted sales in China by nearly 50 percent last year, nudging past Japanese giants Toyota Motor Corp. 7203.T and Honda Motor Co.7267.T to make big inroads into the world's largest auto market.For much of the past decade, Ford has trailed Japan’s big car makers, but a line-up of new and revamped vehicles, including the top-selling Focus, and a China-Japan territorial spat helped the U.S. company in 2013.The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said on Monday that along with its local partners, it had sold 935,813 vehicles in China last year, a 49-percent increase from 2012.Ford still lags a long way behind General Motors CoGM.N and Volkswagen AGVOWG_p.DE which are both expected to announce sales of more than 3 million vehicles in China last year.Toyota and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 917,500 vehicles in China last year, up 9.2 percent from 2012. Honda’s 2013 China volume totaled 756,882 vehicles, up 26.4 percent from 2012.Industry insiders and experts attributed Ford’s surge to its beefed-up product lineup. New in the showroom since late 2012 are a couple of small sport-utility vehicles and the redesigned Focus. It also added the redesigned Mondeo car, a China version of the car marketed in North America as the Fusion, to its lineup.What also helped Ford was a sales crisis that hit Japanese brands in the fall of 2012 and lingered through 2013.Violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in 2012 after Japan nationalized two East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese, by buying them from their private owners. Japanese car makers�� sales in China fell sharply as a result.Toyota and other Japanese companies clawed back sales through 2013 as tensions eased, but Tokyo-Beijing relations could tip again at any time.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month visited the Yasukuni Shrine, seen by critics as a symbol of Japan’s wartime aggression, which infuriated China and South Korea and prompted concern from the United States about deteriorating ties between the North Asian neighbors.Toyota China sales and marketing executives said key new products, including the redesigned RAV4 Toyota-branded compact sport-utility vehicle which was launched during the fourth quarter, helped it recover much of the ground the company lost after a dispute over a group of islets in the East China Sea fanned anti-Japan sentiment in China.Now, Toyota said it aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China this year.That is a milestone Toyota has been trying to clear since the late 2000s.A decade ago, Toyota’s chief executive Akio Toyoda, who back then ran the company’s China operations, and his lieutenants set the “aspirational�� goal of selling one million cars annually by 2010.Also likely to pressure the performance of Toyota and other Japanese brands in China is the surge in sales volume by Ford.Though Ford surpassed Toyota and Honda in China sales volume, it still has miles to go to break into the China's top-three. The likes of GM and Volkswagen AG are well ahead, and it still has considerable ground to make to catch Nissan Motor Co. 7201.T and Hyundai Motor Co005380.KS.According to consulting firm LMC Automotive, the Volkswagen Group is forecast to sell about 3.2 million vehicles in 2013 in China, up from 2.8 million vehicles it sold in 2012. GM is also expected to have sold more than 3 million vehicles last year.Nissan, meanwhile, was aiming to sell 1.25 million vehicles last year. Consulting firm LMC Automotive said Hyundai Group’s sales in China last year should have reached 1.64 million vehicles, up from 1.4 million last year.	-3.75301656

LONDON (Reuters) - Thundering down the long Mulsanne Straight at more than 240kph in the dark, with the car squirming on rainsoaked asphalt and the headlights searching through a murky wall of spray, is no place for the faint-hearted.Allan McNish, two times Le Mans 24 Hours winner and a strong contender in the number two Audi when the sportscar classic celebrates its 90th anniversary next week, is more of a braveheart.The Scot, a former Formula One driver whose ex-Toyota team mates are Audi’s big rivals, walked away from a spectacular crash at the Circuit de la Sarthe in 2011 and has no hesitation in coming back for more.“If there’s something lurking in the back of your mind, you stop racing and you do something else and you get a desk job. It’s that simple,�� he told Reuters in a telephone interview from his Monaco home.“If your inner instinct says you don’t want to drive down a circuit at an average speed of 150mph in the middle of the night then you don’t do it.“My inner instinct says that there’s another Le Mans race victory that’s up for grabs and a world championship at the end of the year and that’s what I’m focusing on doing,�� added the 43-year-old.McNish is partnering Denmark’s eight-times winner Tom Kristensen and Frenchman Loic Duval in the number two factory Audi R18 e-tron quattro. The trio were fastest in last weekend’s eight hours of testing.Audi have won Le Mans 11 times in the last 13 years but McNish’s most recent victory was with Kristensen and now-retired Italian Rinaldo ‘Dindo�� Capello in 2008.The Scot was second last year after hitting the barriers three hours from the end. In 2011, he walked away from a massive impact after contact with a much slower Ferrari in the first hour sent his Audi flying into the barriers, where it disintegrated.Toyota are again the main threat with their hybrid car and McNish expected them to be in contention all the way after making a strong return in 2012 following a 13-year absence.“I don’t think we necessarily saw their pure performance at the races so far this year and certainly we didn’t see it at the weekend,�� he said.“I would say we’ve got to be keeping an eye on the upper end of the pitlane to see what those characters are up to.“Obviously I know the people there... I know the team and I hope they have a fantastic race and finish a very fine third or fourth behind the Audis,�� added the Scot. “There’s no question they will be good, they will be taking the fight to us.”Lapping slower cars is an occupational hazard at Le Mans, where sleek LMP1 prototypes mingle with regular sportscars and fatigue can dull reactions. McNish hoped for a dry race.“Physically Le Mans isn’t demanding because you’ve got such long straights,�� he said. “But when you are going down the Mulsanne at 210 and the car’s aquaplaning underneath you... you do naturally tense up on the steering wheel, you are naturally on the edge of your wits all of the time.“A wet race, and just driving generally in the wet around there, is significantly mentally and physically more tiring than in the dry.“From a driving point of view, I prefer a dry race just purely because I think we’re in pretty good shape in the dry. In the wet you can’t control whether the guy spins in front of you. You can’t in the dry either but you’ve got more chance of it happening in the wet.”With qualifying scheduled for next Thursday, McNish’s immediate priority is to stock up on rest. He stays at home, preparing for a weekend when sleep is sporadic at best.“I am very fortunate, I can sleep anywhere any time,�� said McNish. “But it’s very easy to get caught up in the race. This is Le Mans.“As a driver at my first time in it, as soon as I got out of the car I wanted to know what was happening, I was watching the data, I was looking at the lap times, I was living it as if I was still driving the car.“So physically, I wasn’t driving but mentally I was. And it was absolutely exhausting. With experience, you realize you can’t do that. So you do tend to have your switch-off point and you can get away from it and try to conserve a bit of energy.”Audi will have four specially equipped containers right behind the pits for the drivers to sleep and shower in as well as having doctors, physios and dieticians on hand. That much is under control. The rest can be in the lap of the gods.“Motor racing is always that risk and reward. There is always the chance that it can go wrong with a technical failure or an accident,�� said McNish. “It’s a 24 hour race, it’s like a grand prix season in a day.��	10.44470949
SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday, saying the Japanese car maker would use Nvidia’s artificial intelligence technology to develop self-driving vehicle systems planned for the next few years.Toyota will use Nvidia’s Drive PX artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles planned for market introduction, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his opening keynote at the company’s GPU Technology Conference in San Jose.Nvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called “brain�� of the autonomous vehicle.Nvidia, which also has partnerships with Audi and Mercedes, is among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving car race. Its partnership with Toyota is the latest in a string of alliances between tech companies, automakers and suppliers in the fast-growing sector.Nvidia’s Drive PX supercomputer fuses incoming data from the car’s hardware such as cameras and radar and uses artificial intelligence to help the car understand and react to its environment.“We’re talking about not just development now but the introduction of vehicles into the market,�� said Danny Shapiro, Nvidia’s senior director of automotive. “Now we have the biggest (automaker) in Japan using our Drive PX platform.”In January, Nvidia and Audi VOWG_p.DE said the German automaker would use the Drive PX to help it put autonomous vehicle on the road starting in 2020. Nvidia is also co-developing with Mercedes a project to come to market within the next 12 months, both companies said in January.Toyota, which last year set up a U.S.-based Toyota Research Institute (TRI) to focus on AI and robotics, envisions a dual-track development of autonomous technology. It is simultaneously developing full self-driving cars while also working on what it calls “guardian angel�� partially autonomous technology that may still require involvement from drivers.	-0.3650318233
PARIS (Reuters) - France's top administrative court said it would decide on Tuesday whether to overturn a government ban on the sale of some of Daimler's DAIGn.DE cars in France in a row over coolant fluid.France held up the sale of thousands of Daimler’s Mercedes Benz cars after the German carmaker chose not to equip them with a new, more environmentally friendly coolant.Daimler has asked the court for an injunction overturning the government’s ban, arguing that the new refrigerant, known as R1234yf, poses a potential fire hazard.“The stakes are big,�� Jacques-Henri Stahl, president of the tribunal judging the case in the Council of State, told lawyers for Daimler and the French government during a two-hour hearing on Friday. “We’re at the heart of overlapping national and European issues.”A lawyer for Daimler, Denis Garreau, said the ban affected 60 percent of the company’s sales in France.“No other (EU) member state has taken the measures that France has taken,�� he said, calling it a “brutal decision�� to suspend sales. “Daimler’s position has been jeopardized in France.”France has argued that the ban is legally permissible under an EU law that protects the environment and public health.Japanese carmaker Toyota 7203.T also confirmed it had stopped using the flammable air-conditioning refrigerant in its cars sold in Europe, responding to public pressure in Germany.“We have equipped three models with the old refrigerant in order to respect our customers�� safety concerns because of the controversy in Germany,�� a spokesman for the carmaker said.While Toyota remained “very confident�� about the new coolant’s safety, the company wanted to avoid being drawn into the debate, he said.The group is no longer producing any vehicles for Europe with the R1234yf refrigerant manufactured by Honeywell HON.N and DuPont DD.N. Previously, its Toyota Prius Plus, Lexus GS and GT86 were all equipped with the chemical.	3.666427031
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering creating a sovereign wealth fund to invest in U.S. infrastructure projects and U.S.-Japan joint projects in third countries and will float the idea at two-way trade talks in Washington next week, the Nikkei daily reported on Friday.Tokyo is seeking ways to counter U.S. pressure for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) and head off a rise in tariffs on its auto exports when Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi meets U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington on Aug. 9.Motegi told a news conference on Friday that he wanted to “take some ideas�� to the talks, adding Japan would not make concessions that would hurt its national interests.Finance Minister Taro Aso said separately that Japan was in various talks with the United States on infrastructure, but had no specific plan to set up a sovereign wealth fund.“Japan and the United States are holding various discussions in this area, but at the moment there’s no concrete consideration towards establishing a fund,�� Aso told reporters at a regular news briefing.The Nikkei said that Japan would raise capital from the private sector through bond issues as early as the business year beginning April 2019 and provide low-cost government and possibly public-private loans, taking advantage of the Bank of Japan’s hyper-easy monetary policy.It added that the size of the fund has yet to be determined.The proposal for the fund also urges converting money raised into foreign currency if the yen strengthens beyond around 100 yen to the dollar, a move that might open Japan to criticism of currency manipulation to keep the yen weak, Nikkei added.A ruling party source with knowledge of U.S.-Japan ties said a sovereign wealth fund for infrastructure has been under consideration since April and would likely come up when Motegi meets Lighthizer. But a Japanese government source said such a plan was not being deliberated and was unlikely to be feasible. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told Reuters on Wednesday that Japanese firms were keen to invest in the robust U.S. market and that the government wants to “firmly support and back that��. He did not elaborate.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told reporters the carmaker had no room to increase local production capacity in response to threatened tariffs.Toyota has already committed in 2017 to spend $10 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the next five years.The reported sovereign wealth fund proposal comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week announced a $113 million initiative in technology, energy and infrastructure in Asia and a trilateral push by the United States, Australia and Japan to invest in regional infrastructure projects.It echoes an idea floated last year to buy dollar-denominated “infrastructure bonds�� as a way to take part in U.S. President Donald Trump’s upgrade of U.S. infrastructure.Sumitomo Corp 8053.T Chief Financial Officer Koichi Takahata told reporters the trading house was interested in social infrastructure as a growth sector and would consider it if there were a stable supply of funds and a way to hedge against country risk, a concern in some third countries.Trump wants a two-way trade pact as a way to cut America’s trade deficit with Japan but Tokyo is wary because an FTA would boost pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture.Nishimura and other Japanese officials have said Japan is expected to increase its imports of liquefied natural gas from America and buy U.S. military gear needed for its defense, both of which would help reduce the trade imbalance.But he ruled out setting a numerical limit on Japanese auto exports to the United States, a tactic taken during trade wars in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the 1995 launch of the World Trade Organization, which generally bans such steps.	-7.075399848
TOKYO (Reuters) - Having invested heavily in hydrogen, a technology derided by Tesla chief Elon Musk as “incredibly dumb��, Toyota Motor Corp is making a renewed push for fuel cell cars to fill a role in a future dominated by electric battery vehicles.Japan’s biggest automaker believes both technologies �� all-electric battery cars like the Tesla Model X on one hand and Toyota’s hydrogen Mirai on the other - will be needed to fully usurp gasoline cars.“We don’t really see an adversary ��zero-sum�� relationship between the EV (electric vehicle) and the hydrogen car,�� Toyota chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada told Reuters ahead of the Tokyo auto show. “We’re not about to give up on hydrogen electric fuel-cell technology at all.”Toyota began pitching its fuel-cell car as a mainstream gasoline car alternative in 2014 when it launched the Mirai with a price tag of 7.24 million yen - almost $70,000 at the time.The car has since been launched in the United States and other countries around the world. But initial excitement has faded as major markets including China and Europe have tilted heavily toward electric vehicles.Just 4,300 Mirais have been sold, compared to around 4 million units of the Prius, Toyota’s blockbuster hybrid that ushered in the age of the EV.Uchiyamada, who is known as the “father of the Prius��, says Toyota isn’t anti-EV and is investing heavily in technologies such all solid-state lithium-ion batteries to make them more desirable.But it also sees some advantages for hydrogen cars, which are propelled by electricity generated by fuel cells.One major issue facing EVs is the length of time they take to charge - up to 18 hours in some cases - and a problem being amplified as automakers pack in more batteries to extend range.Rapid charging technology is helping to solve this issue. But a 30- to 40-minute wait is still too long for many ordinary drivers with busy lives, says Yoshikazu Tanaka, the chief engineer in charge of Toyota’s Mirai.What’s worse, rapid charging when used too often compromises battery life significantly, he and other engineers say.While a hydrogen car can refuel in under five minutes, the high cost of the technology and a lack of refuelling stations is a problem, something Toyota has been focused on addressing.The company has joined forces in Japan with rivals Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, and with energy companies such as JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy to build a network of refuelling stations that now totals 91.Tanaka also wants to significantly extend the car’s driving range to compensate for the lack of fuelling stations.While still at the concept stage, Tanaka wants to raise the “practical driving range�� of the Mirai to about 500 km (310 miles) from the current 350-400 km (190-250 miles). A fuel cell car’s practical range usually dips to 65-70 percent of its “sticker�� range - 650 km for the Mirai - because drivers often use air-conditioning and accelerate with abandon.Making the fuel cell system more efficient and trying to gain more propulsion power from a given amount of hydrogen will be key, Tanaka said. He also wants to package the vehicle more efficiently to gain more storage space for larger fuel tanks.Toyota says one of the most promising markets for hydrogen cars is China �� a key advocate of electric cars but one which is beginning to embrace fuel-cell technology as well.Last month, Shanghai announced plans to promote development of fuel-cell vehicles by adding hydrogen refueling stations, subsidizing companies developing fuel-cell technologies and setting up R&amp;D facilities. The city’s goal is to put 20,000 hydrogen fuel-cell passenger vehicles and 10,000 commercial vehicles on the road by 2025.“Chinese policymakers visit us and we visit them frequently�� to discuss Toyota’s hydrogen fuel-cell technology, says Katsuhiko Hirose, a green tech engineer at Toyota.Toyota was set to test hydrogen fuel-cell cars in China this month as part of an effort to determine the feasibility of selling the Mirai there.But it’s not all just about cars.In an effort to encourage other industries to use hydrogen, Toyota and Air Liquide S.A. helped set up the Hydrogen Council, a global lobby launched in January on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.With 27 members including automakers Audi, BMW, Daimler, Honda, Hyundai, and energy companies such as Shell and Total, the Hydrogen Council has lobbying policymakers and investors on hydrogen.The council’s main argument is that electricity supplies can be limited and unstable in high demand. That’s because power grids have small buffers as electricity cannot be stored easily and transported. Large-scale adoption of hydrogen can solve that issue, said Toyota’s Uchiyamada, who is also co-chair of the Hydrogen Council.Electricity generated during the night, which usually goes to waste when unused, and electricity generated by solar and windmills can be stored and easily transported as liquid hydrogen, much like gasoline.“Elon Musk is right - it’s better to charge the electric car directly by plugging in,�� said Tanaka. But hydrogen has a place as a viable alternative to gasoline, he added.	1.719822366

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will idle production lines next week at its plant in Tianjin, northern China, due to weak demand for its cars in China amid anti-Japanese sentiment triggered by a territorial row, Japan's Nikkei newspaper said on Tuesday.Toyota, which plans to halve its overall October output in China compared with a year earlier, may make deeper cuts in the coming months, the paper also said.Two of the Tianjin plant’s three lines will shut down for one week starting October 22, affecting output of sedans such as the Crown and the Reiz.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T are in talks to expand their technology partnership to fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), sources said on Saturday, as global automakers face rising costs to comply with stricter emission regulations.The two Japanese automakers already have a technology and production tie-up, and Toyota was now considering providing fuel-cell and plug-in-hybrid technology to Mazda, said the two sources, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Mazda, in return, was considering offering its partner fuel-efficient gasoline and diesel engine technology under its proprietary SkyActiv series, the sources said.Mazda has been trying to develop FCVs on its own, but it has decided to team up with Toyota, which produces the Mirai, the world’s only mass-market fuel-cell car, the sources said.Toyota has said hydrogen FCVs offer the most promising zero-emission alternative to conventional cars since they have a similar driving range and refueling time.Toyota has already decided to share some of its patents concerning fuel cell technology for free, hoping this will speed up the development of the infrastructure.The Nikkei business daily reported the two companies intended to reach an agreement on the partnership soon.Toyota and Mazda officials said nothing has been decided.	-3.746817024
May 23 (Reuters) - Nissan will join Audi, Porsche and Toyota at Le Mans next year with a full factory entry in the 24-hour sportscar race, the Japanese carmaker said on Friday.Nissan, who have never won at the La Sarthe circuit and last entered a works team in 1999, will also compete in the world endurance championship from 2015.“We won’t be turning up in a vehicle which is a basically another hybrid that looks like another Porsche, Audi or Toyota,�� executive vice-president Andy Palmer said in a statement.“The brief to the team is to go with something different, go with something that brings new technology which is transferable to the road car technology and an approach that is innovative and exciting and of course, go to win.”Mazda are the only Japanese manufacturer to have won Le Mans, doing so in 1991.

TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday posted its largest quarterly operating profit in four years and raised its 2012 global sales target on the strength of demand for cars like the Camry and Prius in key markets such as the United States and Japan.The world’s top automaker reported an operating profit of 353 billion yen ($4.51 billion), from a loss a year ago, a better-than-expected result that underscored its rebound from the natural disasters that blighted 2011.Toyota, which regained its crown as the world’s best-selling automaker in the first half of 2012, said it now expects to sell 9.76 million cars and light trucks globally in 2012. That was up almost 2 percent from its previous forecast.The automaker posted a quarterly operating profit of 353 billion yen ($4.51 billion), compared with a 108-billion yen loss a year ago when production was disrupted by the March earthquake in Japan.The profit for the quarter ending in June was higher than the average estimate of 314.1 billion yen based on eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.In its single biggest and most profitable market, the United States, Toyota sales have snapped higher by 28 percent through July, the biggest gain for any major automaker.The U.S. sales gains have been combined with higher transaction prices, reflecting strong demand for the Prius hybrid and the Camry sedan, the top-selling car in the United States.Toyota said it now expects to sell 2.38 million vehicles in North America in 2012, an upward revision of just over 1 percent to its earlier forecast.The strong performance by Toyota marked a contrast with its closest Japanese rivals.Both Nissan and Honda, which released their quarterly earnings in late July, underperformed analyst expectations, citing the drag from the strong yen and costly sales incentives as they tried to shift older models before putting revamped models on sale.Shares in Toyota have fallen nearly 15 percent in the financial year that began in April. On Friday, they ended at 3,065 yen, up less than 1 percent but outperforming the wider market, which fell more than 1 percent.	-2.501547988

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - David L. Strickland, who oversaw a massive Toyota recall and helped formulate plans to dramatically boost U.S. fuel efficiency standards as head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is stepping down, his office said on Thursday.The date of Strickland’s departure was not announced but the NHTSA said his deputy, David Friedman, would be acting director.Strickland became chief of the NHTSA in January 2010 after eight years as counsel to a subcommittee of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which has oversight of the NHTSA.Shortly after taking the NHTSA job, Strickland found himself dealing with a Toyota recall that eventually covered more than 2 million vehicles in the United States because of unintended acceleration, attributed to problems with floor mats and gas pedals.The NHTSA fined Toyota $32 million for delays in notifying the agency and correcting the acceleration problems. The agency also stepped up its enforcement of recall regulations to make them more timely.Strickland also served as the Obama administration’s point man in getting automakers to agree to nearly double fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Thirteen auto companies, including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Chrysler, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, agreed to the plan.“David Strickland has an impressive list of accomplishments during his time at NHTSA,�� said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “He’s clearly a passionate safety advocate that brought that passion to the role.“While several unresolved issues remain on David Strickland’s docket ... he would likely never find a moment where all open cases are resolved. The agency has survived changes in leadership before, and it should survive this one without letting anything fall between the cracks.��	0.150981379

DETROIT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling about 295,000 Lexus and Toyota brand vehicles globally, mostly in the United States, because various safety systems including stability control and anti-lock brakes could become inoperative.It is recalling vehicles from model years 2012 and 2013 because an electrical component in the brake actuator, which adjusts fluid pressure in each wheel cylinder, may experience increased resistance, according to documents filed with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.That could lead to reduced vehicle control and an increased risk of a crash as various safety systems, including traction control, become inoperative.There have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the issue, said a Toyota spokesman.Of the total recalled, 261,114 were sold in the United States. The rest were exported to other markets, a spokeswoman for the company said.The affected vehicles globally include about 57,000 of the Lexus RX350 crossover vehicles and about 109,000 of the Toyota Tacoma pickup trucks, both from model years 2012 and 2013, she said.In addition, about 129,000 of the Toyota RAV4 SUVs from model year 2012 are affected, she said.In the United states, those numbers were 54,010 RX350 crossovers, 100,052 Tacoma trucks and 107,052 RAV4 SUVs, according to the NHTSA documents.Toyota and Lexus dealers will update the software for the skid control electronic unit free of charge, according to the NHTSA documents.Earlier this week, Toyota recalled all 1.9 million of the third-generation Prius cars sold worldwide due to a programming glitch in their hybrid system.	-4.824561404
LISBON (Reuters) - Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville is set to retake the lead from France’s Sebastian Ogier in the world rally championship on Sunday after building up a commanding advantage on the penultimate day of Rally Portugal.The Belgian, who was last top of the standings in February, goes into the final day 39.8 seconds clear of M-Sport Ford’s Elfyn Evans, with only five timed stages totaling 51km left to complete.Ogier, who started the event with a 10-point lead in the championship, crashed his M-Sport Ford into trees on Friday afternoon.Other leading drivers, including Estonian Ott Tanak, who won the previous round in Argentina for Toyota, have also been sidelined after hitting rocks on the rough dirt roads near the Spanish border.Hyundai’s Spanish driver Dani Sordo ended Saturday’s leg in third place.Neuville, who has won five stages so far, said: “We’ve had a very positive day and can be extremely satisfied with our position. That’s not to say we can relax because we have some tricky stages on Sunday.“We will need to remain concentrated because there are still five stages to go, and we’ve seen just what can happen here.��	-0.2198607549

(Adds Nissan, Ford exec comments in paras 4 and 7; changes date)SHANGHAI, April 20 (Reuters) - Foreign automakers continue to plough money into factories in China, the world’s largest car market, even as the biggest economic slowdown in a quarter of a century crimps sales growth.Market leaders Volkswagen AG and General Motors show no sign of letting up on their planned investments, while Toyota Motor and Ford Motor are also pursuing new China expansion plans.That’s in spite of the economic slowdown further depressing the car market in January-March, when sales grew only 3.9 percent, compared to 9.2 percent a year ago and way below the 7 percent growth that the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) predicts for this year.“It’s still one of the markets with the highest growth in the world so we’re not disappointed in this,�� Carlos Ghosn, CEO of both Nissan Motor and Renault, said at the Shanghai autoshow on Monday. “We are investing in China and we are going to continue investing in China.”Foreign automakers, many of which will unveil new products for China at this week’s Shanghai show, including Ford’s redesigned Taurus sedan, aren’t fretting over the first quarter slowdown. But if the fallout from the broader economic slowdown bleeds into the rest of the year, global automakers may need to reconsider their China expansion plans, said James Chao, Asia chief of IHS Automotive.A handful of foreign automakers are still outperforming the market, with Ford, for example, posting 9 percent sales growth in the first quarter.“We’re very conscious that part of what we do is we match demand with supply. We deal with reality, and if the reality tells us to slow down production, we’ll slow down production,�� Ford’s executive chairman Bill Ford told Reuters on Monday, noting that growth in China was still “quite robust��.IHS’s Chao added the market was still divided into two segments, with domestic manufacturers hovering around 60 percent capacity and the international joint ventures at 80-85 percent.Anthony Lau, Shanghai-based research director for consultancy TNS Sinotrust, said even strong single-digit growth in car sales in China is much better than in markets elsewhere.China accounted for more than half the total industry spending on new or expanded capacity last year, with plant investments worth $12.7 billion, according to an annual Canadian study of automakers�� outlays.Foreign automakers are likely to hoover up more idle capacity from smaller domestic firms, said Chao at IHS, as Ford did in acquiring a factory from Harbin Hafei Automobile that will add 200,000 vehicle per year capacity when upgrades are finished in 2016.That follows Ford’s launch last month of a new factory in eastern China’s Hangzhou, with annual capacity for 250,000 vehicles. ID:nS8N0T100V]Even Toyota, whose first-quarter sales slipped 0.1 percent, is ending a years-long expansion freeze, spending $440 million to add a new facility and a third line at a factory in Guangzhou, which could start production in 2017 with capacity to make about 100,000 cars a year.Volkswagen is targeting China capacity of 5 million vehicles a year by 2019, up from 3.5 million in 2014, as part of a 22 billion euro ($23.3 billion) investment push, a company spokeswoman said, and GM has its sights on hitting that 5 million number a year earlier.By the time these expansions come on-line, the years of breakneck double-digit growth will likely be long gone: economists predict 7 percent GDP growth this year and a further notching down to 6.8 percent in 2016.	0.2018308945

NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of overseas companies declined on Tuesday, led by the losses of Latin American ADRs as remarks about whether the United States can avoid the “fiscal cliff�� increased investors�� anxiety.Among top Latin American decliners were the New York-listed shares of Brazilian oil company Petrobras, down 2.7 percent at $18.13, and shares of Brazilian miner Vale, down 2 percent at $17.30.The BNY Mellon index of leading Latin American ADRs fell 1.4 percent, outrunning losses in the BNY Mellon index of leading American depositary receipts, which ended down 0.7 percent, and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index , which slipped 0.5 percent.Late in the U.S. session, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid expressed disappointment that there has been “little progress�� in dealing with the fiscal cliff. If Congress and the White House can’t agree on a compromise on taxes and spending, then an estimated $600 billion in mandatory tax increases and spending cuts will go into effect early next year. The fear is that this event - known as the fiscal cliff - could push the U.S. economy into a recession.Among Japanese ADRs, top exporters were among the biggest losers, including Honda Motor Co., down 1.9 percent at $32.89, and Toyota Motor Corp., down 1.7 percent at $85.24.The BNY Mellon index of leading Asian ADRs fell 0.7 percent.Canada-based BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd slid 10.5 percent to $10.72.

TOKYO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Most Japanese car makers including Toyota Motor Corp have resumed operations at their plants that were suspended after heavy snow disrupted parts deliveries, companies said on Tuesday, limiting impact on their domestic production volume.But Mazda Motor Corp said it suspended operations on Tuesday morning at its plant in Hiroshima as parts deliveries were delayed and Nissan Motor Co said operations at one of its plants were still stalled.Heavy snow around Japan has closed many roads, disrupting the delivery of goods and suspending car production for one or more days at Toyota, Nissan, Honda Motor Co, Suzuki Motor Corp, Mazda and Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd as they rush to meet strong demand for cars ahead of a sales tax hike in April.“It may be difficult to fully catch up on the lost production volume, though that is up to how much the companies can operate their plants on the weekends,�� said Satomi Hamada, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive.There will be little impact on domestic sales, she added, because car makers are likely to focus on making vehicles for the domestic market to meet strong demand rather than for exports.Toyota resumed operations on Tuesday at all four plants affected by the weather, including the Tsutsumi plant where it makes the popular Prius hybrid, spokeswoman Kayo Doi said.The four plants account for about 30 percent of Toyota’s Japanese production and about 60 percent of vehicles made at the four plants are exported, according to an estimate by IHS Automotive’s Hamada.Honda, Suzuki and Fuji Heavy also resumed operations on Tuesday at their suspended plants, company spokespeople said.

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - For a major new Olympics sponsor, Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corp is oddly invisible at the Pyeongchang winter Games.Unlike other top global sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Visa, Toyota is nowhere to be seen, having sent only a few dozen representatives to South Korea for the event.Its cars are missing from Olympic fleets, the logo is nowhere to be seen and only visiting Toyota officials from other countries such as the United States, whose teams it separately sponsors, can wear Olympic rings on their clothing here.That’s because Toyota realized before signing with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) almost three years ago that these Games, like the South Korean car market, would always belong to Toyota’s local rivals, Hyundai and Kia.“Toyota felt that giving up some of our benefits from these partnerships at Pyeongchang 2018 was the right thing to do after conferring with the International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee,�� a Toyota spokesman said.Toyota signed its nine-year deal with the IOC in 2015, after Pyeongchang was awarded the Games, the result of a 10-year campaign that had been backed by Hyundai and Kia which were already in separate sponsorship talks with local organizers.Toyota still has the right as global IOC sponsor to use the Olympics logos in its advertising elsewhere in the world, and it did so prominently this month in two commercials during the U.S. Super Bowl, when a 30-second ad can cost $5 million.The Japanese firm’s marketing during the Pyeongchang Games, which formally opened on Friday, will be seen in 30 countries -- though not in South Korea, a market where foreign carmakers have long struggled, especially those from Japan.Instead, Hyundai and its affiliate Kia are making the most of their domestic sponsorship rights, having signed their own separate deals with the Pyeongchang Games organizing committee.They have erected pavilions in Olympic venues to show off their latest-technology vehicles, including Hyundai’s hydrogen-fueled autonomous vehicles.Hyundai, whose distinctive all-black pavilion was designed by British architect Asif Khan, has provided 4,100 cars and shuttle buses for the IOC to use for its VIPs and athletes.Hyundai declined to comment.The Pyeongchang organizing committee referred questions to the IOC, which said in an email to Reuters: “In the short term, we worked in partnership with Toyota to enable Pyeongchang to continue their local sponsorship agreement which will provide additional support to the local organizers.”Toyota’s readiness to give up on sponsorship rights in South Korea underlines the tough nature of the market for foreigners, especially for exporters from Japan, a former colonial power that still inspires ill feeling among South Korean consumers.Imported cars make up about 15 percent of the market, and these are mostly from European makers, South Korean industry data show. Toyota has been in the market since 2001 and its brands accounted for barely a tenth of imports last year.Insisting on the domestic rights might not only have been futile from a marketing perspective, it could have backfired.David Krysiek, chief executive of Atlanta-based brand communications firm Brandware, said Toyota avoided “the disastrous prospect of being seen as a carpet-bagger in Korea��.Toyota can at least count on dominating at the next Olympics, the summer Games in Tokyo in 2020, but the one after that could prove tricky: the 2022 winter Olympics in Beijing.China, parts of which were also colonized by Japan, is another auto market that is tough for Japanese firms, but it is the world’s largest and Toyota has no plans to take a step back from the domestic sponsorship rights, as it did in South Korea.In 2012, Japanese car sales in China nose-dived during a flare-up in a territorial dispute between the two nations. Thousands of Japanese-brand cars were vandalized and mobs attacked dealerships in several cities.Sentiment has since recovered, and Toyota has set an upbeat sales forecast in China for this year.“Right now things are more or less back to normal, but we are still handicapped by the past,�� said the head of a major Japanese carmaker’s China operations, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.He said “normal�� meant that about 10 percent of Chinese consumers would not contemplate buying a Japanese car.Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports &amp; Entertainment Marketing Group, who helped create the IOC top sponsors program, said there was also little risk in China that Toyota would be seen to be gatecrashing a party meant for local carmakers.“China has its own local auto industry but it’s not like what Hyundai and Kia means to Korea,�� he said.	-6.313058518

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A U.S. auto regulator asked 29 carmakers to disclose if the safety of any of their vehicles or engines containing products supplied by Kobe Steel Ltd could be affected by data cheating, according to a letter seen by Reuters.Japan’s third-largest steelmaker, which supplies the makers of cars, planes, trains and other industrial products across the world, said in October that about 500 of its customers had received products with falsified specifications, in one of the country’s biggest industrial scandals.In a previously undisclosed special order dated Nov. 8, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) asked a range of companies including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc to file reports to the agency.It also asked for details about materials testing and documents from Kobe Steel about products not meeting specifications. Companies were given until Dec. 28, but some were given extensions, according to a person briefed on the matter.Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade association representing major automakers, said automakers “are cooperating with the agency in responding to the special order.”Other companies on the list, including Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Navistar International Corp, Daimler AG , Harley-Davidson Inc and Forest River Inc, a recreational vehicle manufacturer owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc did not immediately comment or declined to comment.Toyota, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co said in Japan in October they had found no safety issues with Kobe products.NHTSA Deputy Administrator Heidi King declined to comment on the special order.A Kobe Steel spokesman in Japan did not respond to a request for comment.Outside investigators appointed by Kobe to look into the malpractice found that senior officials in the company’s copper and aluminum business knew of some of the cheating.The company said in December that investigation would be completed by around the end of February, two months later than expected.Kobe has also said it is the subject of a separate U.S. Justice Department inquiry.

* Sees total US sales close to 16 mln consensus view* Fewer customers seen replacing aging vehicles* Housing, construction recovery to buoy pickup trucksLOS ANGELES, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The United States automotive industry will move into the slow lane in 2014 as fewer buyers replace aging vehicles and growth drops to half this year’s rate, the head of Toyota Motor Corp’s North American operations said on Wednesday.While U.S. industry sales are expected to grow by 1 million vehicles to 15.5 million this year, Toyota North American Chief Executive Jim Lentz said he expects the 2014 total to be closer to 16 million.“Do I think we’re going to grow another million this next year? I don’t think so,�� Lentz said in an interview at the Los Angeles Auto Show.“We’re going to see a tapering off of that growth over time because a lot of that pent-up demand that was out there has been satisfied.”In addition to new vehicles and lower interest rates, Lentz, like many industry executives, credited growth this year to the need for consumers to replace vehicles that are now on average more than 11 years old, a record.While his company hasn’t finalised its forecast for total U.S. market sales in 2014, Lentz said the general consensus was around 16 million, and Toyota’s estimate would likely be close to that total.Honda Motor Co’s U.S. CEO Tetsuo Iwamura said on Wednesday at the show that his company expects U.S. industry sales next year to be in the high 15 million range, above this year’s volumes.Lentz said he expects pent-up demand for vehicles other than full-size pickup trucks to taper off next year. Pickup truck demand will remain strong because that is tied to the recovering housing and construction markets and the average age of those vehicles remains very high.“When you look at it segment by segment, with the exception of pickup truck I think a lot of that pent-up demand has probably already been satisfied,�� he said.Lentz said the growth the U.S. industry sees next year will be driven by lower unemployment and higher consumer confidence, and said he was not concerned about a return to profit-sapping incentive wars.The executive said most automakers have remained disciplined about incentives. Most could easily reduce capacity if needed by simply eliminating overtime shifts at assembly plants, he said, rather than be forced to offer consumers ever more generous deals.Lentz also called reports that Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd’s Subaru brand would stop building Toyota Camry sedans at its Indiana plant “premature,�� saying the two sides were still negotiating.The contract is expected to end after 2016. Lentz said Subaru builds 80,000 to 100,000 cars annually for Toyota.“We’re evaluating whether or not we need that capacity at Subaru or not,�� he said. “There’s still conversations going on within the company and between the two companies, but I can tell you a decision has not been made.”A Subaru spokesman confirmed the sides are still in talks.Lentz also said Toyota realises it needs to become more bold in its designs for the flagship Camry mid-sized sedan, citing increased competition in the segment over the last three to five years driven by Hyundai Motor Co’s Sonata.“We understand we need to get more aggressive in the styling of that car,�� he said of the Camry.Lentz said Toyota would rather spend more to improve the car’s design than offer higher incentives. “The sooner we can make modifications to the vehicle, the better off we are.”Toyota’s last major redesign of the Camry was in 2011. LMC Automotive said the next major overhaul is not scheduled until the summer of 2016.Lentz declined to comment on the timetable for any design changes.	-5.04736884
NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Lawyers from across the United States gathered in Manhattan Monday to jockey for leadership roles in litigation against General Motors over a faulty ignition switch that has prompted the recall of millions of vehicles.Nearly 40 lawyers waited for hours to make four-minute pitches to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, who is overseeing the cases, during a marathon hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.Numerous other lawyers have submitted written applications for one of 15 lead spots in the litigation, which so far consists of 109 cases involving claims over personal injuries and diminished vehicle value related to the recall.Since February, GM has recalled 2.6 million vehicles over problems with the ignition switch, and has since recalled millions more with other possible defects.Some well-known lawyers were among those making their cases Monday, including David Boies, a high-profile litigator who has handled marquee same-sex marriage and antitrust cases, and Joseph Rice, who has represented plaintiffs in mass litigation over asbestos, tobacco and the 2010 BP oil spill.Boies, who is applying to serve as one of three lead counsel or alternatively on the 10-member executive committee, said his national profile and his firm’s resources would give plaintiffs an edge in court.“This is an important case, a high-profile case, and you need the very best lawyers,�� he told Furman. “This is not a time for false modesty.”The lawyers Furman appoints will be expected to devote substantial time and resources to litigation efforts up front, in hopes of recovering a sizable share of legal fees from any eventual settlement or judgment.Also seeking top roles Monday were a number of lawyers who led litigation against Toyota Motor Corp over acceleration issues starting in 2010. Furman has appointed Steve Berman, Elizabeth Cabraser and Mark Robinson, who helped spearhead those cases, to serve as temporary lead counsel in the GM litigation. Furman cautioned that the current assignments did not guarantee them a future role.Berman said the Toyota litigation would be a valuable road map for plaintiffs suing GM. Toyota settled economic-loss claims stemming from the acceleration litigation in 2012 in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.“I spent two and a half years of my life dealing with the issues (in Toyota) that we’ll deal with here,�� he told Furman.Furman said he planned to make the appointments by the end of the week.

TOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Japan and India will next week agree to jointly produce mixed rare earth, with Japan set to start importing from India in 2015 as it tries to wean itself of its reliance on China, the Nikkei business daily said on Thursday.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indian counterpart Narendra Modi will agree on the joint production at their summit meeting in Tokyo on Monday, the report said, without citing sources.Indian Rare Earths, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Department of Atomic Energy, and Japanese trading house Toyota Tsusho will sign a contract on joint production as early as September, it added.The Indian company will make mixed rare earth materials from uranium and thorium ores, which Toyota Tsusho will use to produce neodymium for electric and hybrid cars, as well as lanthanum, cerium and praseodymium, the report said.Annual production will be about 2,000 tonnes to 2,300 tonnes, equal to around 15 percent of Japan’s demand, and roughly 2,000 tonnes a year could be exported to Japan starting as early as February, it added.A Toyota Tsusho spokesman said the firm was checking the report.China produces more than 90 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. Despite Japan’s attempts to diversify supplies after China’s cuts in export quotas several years ago, Japan still relies on China for the majority of rare earths for making electronics, magnets and clean technology.China this month lost an appeal at the World Trade Organization in a case brought by the United States, the European Union and Japan to challenge China’s restrictions on exports of rare earths, and is obliged to cancel its strict export quotas to abide by the ruling.India is hoping to win Japanese backing for a nuclear energy pact during a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and lure investment into its $85 billion market while addressing Japan’s concern about doing business with a nuclear-armed country.

DETROIT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Asian rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Kia Motors unveiled concept sports cars this week that appear to target different demographics but share a common goal to add some sizzle to their brands.Toyota said the FT-1, a muscular-looking coupe unveiled Monday at the Detroit auto show, would deliver the type of heart-pumping performance CEO Akio Toyoda has complained is lacking in its fleet of reliable but predictably designed cars.Toyota said it was not sure whether it would take the car into production and did not disclose specifications. But analysts believe it is plotting a return to the segment after discontinuing the Supra more than a decade ago, and that it will likely produce a high-performance model catering to a well-heeled clientele.Kia, meanwhile, appears to have a younger client in mind with its 315-horsepower GT4 Stinger, which also had its debut at the auto show. It cited the Mazda MX5 and Scion FR-S - a Toyota offshoot brand focused on young customers - as possible competitors down the road.“I don’t see this concept competing with Porsche or Ferrari or Lamborghini or something. There are other mass market brands which offer sporty cars,�� Tom Kearns, Kia’s chief U.S. designer, told Reuters.Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, and Kia, a much smaller South Korean affiliate of Hyundai Motors, are in vastly different stages of their development. But both see a sports car as a way to invigorate their brands.For Toyota launching a high-performance vehicle would bring an excitement into their line-up that has been largely missing since it called it quits on the Supra in the U.S. market in 1998, said Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell.“It has been accused of very boring, appliance-like cars. I think they need to do something to shake it up,�� Caldwell said, adding that she believes it should revive the Supra brand. “Older people remember it, they like it.”While Kia doesn’t have any track record in sports cars to build on, it could have success if it is priced under $25,000 - putting it in the same price range as the youth-focused FR-S, Caldwell said. She reckons Toyota might look to compete at a higher price point, somewhere between the FR-S and a Porsche.Both companies seemed resigned to forgo the pursuit of big profit margins in return for the elusive “halo effect�� a high-performance or trend-setting car can generate.Jim Lentz, head of Toyota’s North American operations, said Toyota has had good results with that strategy in the past, such as with the retro style FJ Cruiser SUV. But with sports cars demand can disappear quickly after an initial spurt, he warned.“Not to say that people don’t do sports cars because of the halo effect it has for brands. But in terms of the business of selling cars and making money on cars, sports cars don’t make a lot of sense,�� Lentz said.Hank Lee, vice chairman of Kia Motors, told reporters the sports car concept is part of its efforts to launch another attention-grabbing vehicle after its success with the Soul box car. He said it would decide whether to produce the GT4 Stinger after evaluating consumer response.The GT4 Stinger, which features Kia’s signature front grille, vertical LED headlights and a swooping roofline, is the next logical step in the company’s development in the U.S. market, Kearns said.While over the years Kia has transformed its image from a maker of low-priced cars, it needs more excitement to drive traffic to their showrooms, even if it means sacrificing some profits on producing a sports car, Kearns said.`“Even if you don’t make a huge amount of money, it doesn’t mean that it is a failure because the way it changes your image, and attracts a different type of customers that we don’t have now,�� he said.	-3.599229932
Toyota Motor Corp is considering shifting some of its vehicle production from Thailand to the Philippines to spread its risk, Malaya Business Insight quoted the head of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) as saying.Representatives from Toyota Thailand discussed at a recent meeting between PCCI and the Federation of Thai Industries the possibility of assembling in the Philippines a Toyota sport utility vehicle model currently 100 percent assembled in Thailand, the report said.

TOKYO, April 24 (Reuters) - Didi Mobility Japan, a joint venture (JV) by China’s Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Corp, said on Wednesday that it would expand its taxi-hailing service to 13 cities across Japan.Despite SoftBank’s oversized presence in the global ride-hailing industry, such services are effectively banned in Japan, leaving SoftBank portfolio companies like Didi and Uber limited to offering services that match taxis with customers.The app launched in September in Osaka, a popular destination for Chinese tourists, where it tied up with taxi firms to enter an increasingly crowded market for such apps that includes rivals backed by Sony Corp and Toyota Motor Corp.Didi is among a growing number of SoftBank Group Corp-backed companies launching joint ventures with SoftBank’s domestic telco. Other startups doing so are shared co-working firm WeWork Cos and Indian hotel startup OYO. (Reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Himani Sarkar)	-3.523763021
(James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)Nov 6 (Reuters) - Toyota’s sparkling earnings show how Abenomics may be good for Japanese companies now, but perhaps a bust for investing in Japan over the long term.Toyota, the world’s biggest car maker, reported a 70 percent jump in profits last quarter, as it got a boost from this year’s 12 percent drop in the yen against the dollar .A look under the hood, however, shows that Toyota’s gains may not translate into the sustained expansion Japan hopes Abenomics will spark. Named after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Abenomics is an attempt to use government spending, radical monetary policy and competitive reform to finally rescue Japan from a 20-year-plus slump.The first step was to hammer the yen lower, making Japanese exporters more globally competitive. A weaker yen has helped Toyota, but not perhaps in the way policymakers want.Two things have to happen for Abenomics to succeed. First, external demand prompted by a weaker yen needs to drive a self-sustaining consumer expansion. That requires wage gains.Second, companies need to invest and expand, using a new pricing advantage from the yen to build volume, not simply to make more money on every car sold.On the evidence thus far, neither of the two needed things is happening or is likely to happen.Consider Toyota. While profits are up 70 percent, most of the focus is on increasing margins, with capital expenditure forecast to rise just 2 percent and research and development forecast to stay the same.That’s hardly the massive expansion Japan needs.And while Toyota, and others, have indicated a willingness to boost wages in the future if profits continue to roll in, thus far they’ve been far more likely to hand out bonuses rather than make permanent increases in their fixed costs.It looks very much, in other words, as if Toyota, and likely many other companies, are happy to increase profit margins but not take on the risks of paying more and expanding rapidly. Given the history of the auto industry and Japan itself, it is hard to blame them.Japanese workers, having lived through the past 20 years, are understandably wary about increasing spending permanently based on a one-off bonus.And while Abe said in October that higher wages were “vital�� and has used various forums to pressure companies, even corporate tax cuts haven’t had much of an effect. A recent Reuters corporate survey found that only 5 percent of respondents would use additional savings to raise wages.This leaves Japanese workers in a difficult bind. Prices are rising at last, at least a bit, but wages not so much.Core consumer prices, which include oil products but not fresh food, rose 0.7 percent in the year to September. Even so-called ‘core-core�� prices, which excludes both food and energy, were flat, the first time since 2008 that they have not fallen.While that might seem like cause for rejoicing, wages have been stagnant. Salaries are in their longest slide since 2010, with regular wages excluding overtime and bonuses down 0.3 percent in September. Total cash earnings rose 0.1 percent.Minutes of the Bank of Japan’s October meeting, recently released, showed some disquiet over the pace of wage gains, with one member noting that sustained gains might not appear before the annual wage negotiation round next April. Except then a consumption tax will increase by 3 percentage points, almost certainly more than swamping any wage increases.The fear, of course, is that consumers won’t consume, and when next April’s consumption tax comes along, Japan will drift back into deflation and recession. And remember, Japan, as a country with very large debts and a demographic downward path, needs inflation. Only inflation, and genuine growth, will allow it to manage its debts over the longer term.Here again we have a great example of how extraordinary monetary policy creates risks for everyone while handing out what may be short-term benefits disproportionately to the wealthy. The Nikkei 225 stock index is up by a third this year, and by 50 percent over the past year. Profits among exporters are, by and large, growing quite well.Even those gains may prove to be short-lived, and taking a five-year view, investors would be wise to be very cautious about the future of Abenomics and Japanese assets.

Oct 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp must face a trial over claims that it failed to warn the public about design defects that caused certain vehicles to accelerate unintentionally, a federal judge in California has ruled.U.S. District Judge James Selna in the Central District of California on Monday denied Toyota’s motion to dismiss defective-design and failure-to-warn claims brought against it by the estate of Ida St. John, who said in 2009 that her 2005 Camry sped out of control and hit a school building. She died after giving that testimony, but the lawsuit does not claim that her death was caused by the crash.The judge did grant the Japanese automaker’s motion to dismiss manufacturing defect and negligence claims.St. John testified that her Camry accelerated even though she did not press the pedal. The trial, slated to begin Nov. 5, will be one of the first of the many federal lawsuits focusing on the Toyota acceleration issues that prompted the automaker to recall millions of vehicles beginning in 2009.The first federal sudden-acceleration case to go to trial ended with a win for Toyota in 2011, in a lawsuit brought by a doctor who worked in Brooklyn.A spokeswoman for Toyota, Amanda Rice, said in a statement on Tuesday that St. John failed to prove the vehicle was defective and that the company is “confident the evidence at trial will confirm that Toyota drivers can depend on their vehicles to provide safe, reliable transportation.”A lawyer for the St. John estate, Todd Walburg, said in a statement, “It’s time for a jury to hear about the defects that we’ve been studying over the past three years.”Since the recall, more than 500 individual and 200 proposed class-action lawsuits have been filed against Toyota in U.S. federal and state courts, according to a regulatory filing from the Japanese automaker.Toyota said the 2005 Camry was not subject to acceleration related recalls.In her lawsuit, St. John said Toyota received thousands of complaints about unintentional acceleration in vehicles equipped with electronic throttle control systems, which connect the accelerator to the engine. The company failed to warn customers, she alleged.Toyota asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying the collision could have been caused by driving errors and contending that St. John did not demonstrate a connection with alleged defect or system failure in the vehicle.But the judge on Monday said that testimony St. John previously gave, coupled with expert evidence submitted by the plaintiffs, “supports inferences from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the Camry continued to accelerate and failed to slow or stop despite her application of the brakes.”Selna also presided over a separate group of lawsuits over alleged economic losses stemming from acceleration issues. He signed off in July on a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve those claims, which did not include personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits.In a separate case, jurors in California state court are deliberating in the first sudden-acceleration case to be tried there, involving the death of a woman after her 2006 Camry crashed into a tree.	-0.5621047701
SEOUL, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co said on Thursday it had invested in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab, in the South Korean automaker’s first foray into the rapidly growing sector as it tries to diversify following a sales slump in China.Grab has expanded to eight Southeast Asian countries and has said it is the biggest operator in the region’s third-party taxi hailing and private-vehicle hailing sector.The companies will jointly develop services in Southeast Asia, including one utilising Hyundai’s eco-friendly models such as the IONIQ Electric, the two firms said in a statement.They did not disclose the value of Hyundai’s investment and a spokeswoman for the automaker declined to comment further.Grab’s latest fundraising round, which Hyundai has joined, already includes investors such as China’s Didi Chuxing, Japan’s SoftBank and Toyota Tsusho, the firms added.Hyundai said on Wednesday it is considering building a car plant in Southeast Asia, possibly in Indonesia or Vietnam.The company’s interest in the region has grown since a diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul last year hurt South Korean firms that are highly reliant on the Chinese market.The automaker also announced for the first time a self-driving technology partnership with Silicon Valley start-up Aurora earlier this month, a shift from its usual preference for developing technology itself.	1.351252648
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese exporters will hand out bigger bonuses for the next fiscal year as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies drive the yen to multi-year lows, with Toyota Motor Corp declaring its largest bonus payout since the global financial crisis.However, major companies including Toyota 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T kept base salaries unchanged in the year ending March 2014.Since taking power in December, Abe has been prescribing a mix of fiscal and monetary measures with an aim of lifting the economy out of two decades of deflation. The prime minister has also called for higher wages, seen crucial to boosting household expenditure, consumer prices and ultimately corporate earnings.“The bonus increase will have less effect on boosting private spending than a rise in base salary because people tend to save such temporary increases,�� said Yasuo Yamamoto, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute in Tokyo.“It is the beginning towards a full-fledged recovery in private spending. But the economy needs to continue recovering to achieve that.”Abe’s policy stimulus has so far pushed the yen to 3-1/2 year lows against the dollar, supporting exporters including automakers. Exports account for around 16 percent of the Japanese economy, the third-largest in the world.Citing improving global economic conditions and stimulus at home, the Japanese government has forecast the economy would grow 2.5 percent in real terms in the next fiscal year, up from 1.0 percent this year.Data on Tuesday showed Japanese consumer confidence hit its highest in February since mid-2007.For the year ending March 2014, Toyota plans to increase bonuses by about 270,000 yen ($2,800) on average from a year earlier.In February, Toyota lifted its annual net profit guidance for the year to March by more than 10 percent and said it expects its Japanese manufacturing business to be back in the black for the first time in five years.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, decided not to raise base wages. The union did not ask for a wage increase because while the yen has dropped in the recent months, it still remains strong compared with five years ago.The last time Toyota, which employs about 69,000 people in Japan, gave a base pay rise was five years ago, according to the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers�� Unions.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Fuji Heavy Industries 7270.T also decided to raise bonuses while keeping wages unchanged.The scale of bonuses as announced by companies in Japan on Wednesday vary. Hitachi Ltd 6501.T said it will raise its bonus payment by about 160,000 yen on average.For many other electronics makers including Panasonic, which employs 128,000 staff in Japan, bonuses will depend on business results. They also kept wages unchanged.An exception was retailer Seven &amp; I Holdings Co 3382.T, the owner of the 7-11 convenience store chain, which said this month it will increase base pay for about 53,500 employees.The results of the annual wage negotiations between labor unions and companies confirmed a recent Reuters poll that showed a majority of Japanese firms were reluctant to play along with Abe’s calls to raise wages.After the collapse of the bubble economy in the 1980s, many Japanese companies cut salaries to keep workers on the payroll instead of mass layoffs, and that trend has stuck.Average wages, closely correlated with consumer prices, have been declining since 1998, data from the National Tax Agency show. Last year, the average monthly income for Japanese wage earners stood at 314,236 yen ($3,300), the lowest since comparable data became available in 1990. ($1 = 95.9900 Japanese yen)	7.291867877
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators from states where foreign automakers build cars introduced bipartisan legislation on Wednesday that would bar the Trump administration from imposing up to 25 percent tariffs on imported cars and parts until the International Trade Commission conducted a comprehensive study of auto industry.Senators Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat, and Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, have said the tariffs could harm foreign automakers like Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and Daimler AG and the industry has said it could hike vehicle costs by $83 billion and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. The legislation faces uphill odds in Congress. The Commerce Department is investigating whether auto imports pose a national security risk.	-5.145128628

ROMULUS, Mich. (Reuters) - Long before the pistons for General Motors Co V-6 engines reach the U.S. No. 1 automaker’s Romulus, Michigan plant, they are seasoned international travelers.Powdered aluminum from Tennessee is shipped to Pennsylvania and forged at high temperatures into connecting rods for the pistons, which are then sent to Canada to be shaped and polished. They are then shipped to Mexico for sub-assembly and finally the finished pistons are loaded onto trucks bound for Romulus to become part of a GM V-6 engine.The parts make four international border crossings in all, without a single tariff levied.“They already have their passports,�� said Jim Bovenzi, GM’s executive director of global supply chain on a recent tour of the Romulus plant. “We look at North America as a borderless region. We have parts and components coming back and forth across the border all the time.”GM’s V-6 engine is just one example of how GM and rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have used the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to shift work to lower-cost facilities across the continent, cutting expenses and boosting returns from the region that represents the bulk of their global profits.U.S. President Donald Trump now seeks to replace NAFTA with the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed by the countries�� leaders last November, which he says will boost American jobs.U.S. automakers have lobbied hard for the new treaty to preserve NAFTA’s effective lack of borders, and say they can work with it because it does just that.However, if Trump follows through on his repeated threats to pull the United States out of NAFTA if the U.S. Congress does not ratify USMCA, automakers would be forced to pay a patchwork of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules.That would destroy the cost advantages of their cross-border supply chains - which include U.S. companies employing American workers - and would likely force automakers to redesign their manufacturing models and find cheaper alternatives elsewhere, industry experts say.The uncertainty means automakers and manufacturers are holding off on key investments.“A lot of our production is very, very capital intensive and when you’re deploying that much capital you want to have a clear sense of what the rules are,�� said Everett Eissenstat, GM’s vice president for global public policy. “It’s quite important for us to get those (USMCA) rules in place so we can have some stability and predictability to continue to produce and invest here in the United States.”U.S. business investments fell 3% in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter, due to concerns over mounting trade tensions, including the issue of NAFTA and tariffs worldwide.“Businesses are already becoming more cautious about investments,�� said Michael Gregory, head of U.S. economics at BMO Capital Markets. “If we get to the point where the administration is actively talking about tearing up NAFTA, I think that would trump any concern about China.”Democrats, who are pushing for more labor and environmental protections in the new treaty, say they are making progress toward passing USMCA in 2019. But if that does not happen, it risks being postponed in 2020 ahead of the next presidential election, which would mean an extended period of uncertainty.GM’s Romulus Powertrain plant makes about 400,000 V-6 engines a year for high-margin Cadillac SUVs, light pickup trucks and other GM vehiclesThe pistons that end their long journey there are only a small part of the 70-plus trucks bearing parts such as engine blocks or cylinder heads, that arrive there daily.The Romulus-built V-6 uses 235 parts from 100 primary suppliers. Sixty-seven ship from factories in the United States, 13 from Mexico, 8 from Canada and 12 from elsewhere in the world. Most of the electronics come from Asia.All told, GM spends $71 billion a year on materials, sourcing 133,000 different parts from 3,100 primary suppliers.At Romulus, five trucks daily carrying 288 100-pound (45 kg) engine blocks - the heart of the V-6 engine - each come from either a GM casting operation in Saginaw, Michigan, or a supplier in Mexico.The Mexican parts are cheaper, GM’s Bovenzi said, but using dual suppliers reduces the risk of relying on one plant for a critical part like the engine block.The more labor intensive it is to make, the more likely a part is sourced from Mexico, according to James Rubenstein, a professor of geography at Oxford, Ohio-based Miami University who has studied the automobile industry and NAFTA.“Final assembly costs don’t affect the overall cost of a vehicle that much,�� he said. “Focusing on labor-intensive parts further down the chain is what really makes a difference.”When the V-6 engines - now weighing around 500 pounds - are unloaded at GM’s Spring Hill plant near Nashville, an even bigger marriage of components takes place.As individually labeled V-6 engines move down the line - for Cadillacs and Acadias - about 200 parts from 88 different suppliers are attached. Fifty-eight are American, 12 Mexican, 5 Canadian and 13 from elsewhere.Spring Hill workers install an automatic transmission from a GM plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a starter and generator made in Tennessee by Japanese supplier Denso Corp, an air conditioning compressor made by Denso in Michigan, a drive belt made by Gates Industrial Corp Plc in Mexico, tensioners and a pulley made by Gates in Canada, converters made in Tennessee by Tenneco Inc and battery cables from China.Ford and Fiat Chrysler, alongside other major automakers like Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, have all built up similar international supply chains to support their North American assembly operations.The lower costs achieved by such diverse sourcing means better margins on higher-priced vehicles like the Cadillac XT6. The SUV retails for $55,490, almost $20,000 above the average U.S. new car price, and is one of GM’s higher-margin vehicles.The use of lower-cost countries for more labor intensive parts is now “part of the recipe to compete in the global market,�� said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Michigan.European automakers, for instance, have similarly moved production of parts to cheaper, tariff-free countries within the European Union.Tearing up NAFTA or imposing tariffs would hurt U.S. automakers�� competitiveness, according to Dziczek.CAR estimated in June that the average price of a U.S.-made vehicle would rise $1,100 if Trump carried out his threat of levying tariffs of up to 25% on Mexican imports over illegal immigration.North American tariffs would force automakers to move sourcing of lower-cost parts from Mexico to other cheap markets like Vietnam, Dziczek said.That would be bad for Mexican suppliers, but would also hurt U.S. suppliers and defeat Trump’s aim to boost U.S. jobs, as shuttling parts back and forth between Asia and the United States would not be cost effective.“If we weren’t getting it from Mexico, we’d be getting it from somebody else’s ‘Mexico��,�� Dziczek said. “And the further away that ‘Mexico�� is, the less likely it is American suppliers would benefit from that business.��	-0.06300315016
LONDON (Reuters) - Fernando Alonso will make history as the first Formula One champion to compete in the Dakar Rally when the world’s toughest endurance event enters a new era in Saudi Arabia on Sunday and the star rookie has no illusions about the challenge.Nothing in the 38-year-old Spaniard’s track career compares to the obstacles ahead, including 250 meter high dunes, over thousands of kilometers from Jeddah to the finish in Qiddiya on Jan. 17.“The challenge of the Dakar is undoubtedly the biggest I have faced in my sporting career,�� the Monaco Grand Prix winner, double Le Mans 24 Hours champion and Indianapolis 500 contender said when his entry was announced last year.“But taking on things that look impossible on paper and trying to make them possible in six or seven months of preparation is a thrilling challenge.”Alonso, who is driving a Toyota Hilux pickup with five times motorcycle winner and compatriot Marc Coma alongside as co-driver, will be happy to finish.The only ex-Formula One drivers to win the Dakar are Belgian Jacky Ickx, also a former Ferrari ace and Le Mans champion, in 1983 and Frenchman Jean-Louis Schlesser in 1999 and 2000 although many have tried.This year’s Dakar is held for the first time in the Middle East, with the event moving from South America a decade after it had left Saharan Africa for security reasons.The route will visit the mountains in the north and the Rub al Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter��, desert region in the south.Defending champion Nasser al-Attiyah of Qatar remains a favorite with the same Toyota team as Alonso.The field also includes Spaniard Carlos Sainz, a double Dakar winner and father of the McLaren Formula One driver, as well as record 13-times champion Stephane Peterhansel.The Frenchman had hoped to race with wife Andrea as co-driver but doctors ruled her out on health grounds..Saudi riders or drivers will be present in all categories, with Yazid al Rajhi a contender with Toyota after finishing seventh last year.On two wheels, dominant KTM -- winners for the past 18 years -- return with the last three champions in Australian Toby Price, Austrian Matthias Walkner and Dubai-based Briton Sam Sunderland.There will be some 351 starters but the switch to Saudi Arabia, which lifted a ban on women driving in June 2018, has drawn criticism from rights activists.“More than a dozen women drivers will take part in the Dakar Rally while Saudi women activists languish in jail for promoting the right to drive,�� said Ines Osman, director of MENA Rights Group, in a statement with Human Rights Watch and 11 other campaigners.	-1.314200469
TOKYO (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake in northern Japan last week rose to 44, with 660 injured, the government said on Monday, as electricity supply remained short and top automaker Toyota suspended work at most of its assembly plants.The pre-dawn, 6.7-magnitude quake on Thursday temporarily paralyzed the island of Hokkaido, cutting off access by air and train and knocking out power to an island the size of Austria.About 2,500 people remain in evacuation centers, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, after landslides buried houses and rain at the weekend loosened soil in a further threat to unstable houses.Yoshihide Suga, the top government spokesman, said a team of about 40,000 Self-Defense Force troops, police, firefighters and others were working on clearing debris and other clean-up operations. There were no more missing residents, he said.Power supply has been restored to nearly all customers in Hokkaido but trade minister Hiroshige Seko called on the island’s businesses and 5.3 million residents to use about 20 percent less energy to prevent further blackouts.“It’s very important now for all residents, businesses, the government, and electricity suppliers to work together towards this goal of 20 percent energy-saving,�� Seko told a news conference late on Sunday.The government has no plans for rolling blackouts on Monday and Tuesday despite the continued closure of a fossil fuel-fired power plant that supplies about half the island’s power, he said.With electricity restored, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday its parts factory in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, which builds transmissions and other components, was preparing to resume production during the night shift.However, the fallout has already spread beyond the island, with Toyota suspending production at 16 of its 18 domestic car assembly plants on Monday to assess its parts inventory. The automaker said it would gradually restore production from Tuesday, resuming work fully by Thursday.	-1.174693741

* Companies, working parents caught flat-footed* Angry parents take to social media* Experts, analysts slate move as political, ineffective* Interactive graphic tracking coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in external browserTOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Angry Japanese parents joined bewildered teachers and businesses on Friday in a rush to find new ways to live and work for a month after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s shock call for all schools to close in a bid to stop coronavirus spreading.Abe’s unprecedented move late on Thursday to ask local authorities to shut down their schools means students will be out of school from Monday at least until the new academic year starts in early April.Earlier this week the government urged that big gatherings and sports events be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to contain the virus while pledging that the 2020 Summer Olympics will go ahead in Tokyo.As of Friday, confirmed cases in Japan topped 200, with four deaths, excluding more than 700 cases and four more deaths from the quarantined cruise liner Diamond Princess. While the virus has hit China hardest so far, causing nearly 80,000 infections and almost 2,800 deaths, according to official Chinese figures, its rapid spread to a number of other countries around in the world in the past week has stoked fresh alarm.Abe’s move - issued as a formal request rather than an order - drew scathing criticism, with health officials left scratching their heads and analysts said the plan was politically motivated and made little sense.“We’ll just have to get our revenge at the next elections,�� @Ayu49Sweetfish tweeted, as working parents with young children were left wondering what to do for the duration.In the northern Hokkaido prefecture, which has seen the largest number of coronavirus cases in Japan, the governor had already announced a closure of all schools until March 4. That left one hospital closing doors to patients without reservations on Friday because about a fifth of its nurses were unable to work while their children were out of school.“We don’t know how this could be extended further,�� an official at the facility, JA Hokkaido Koseiren Obihiro Kosei Hospital, told Reuters.As the coronavirus spreads, more companies like Mitsubishi Corp have said they would allow workers to telecommute. But a survey in the Nikkei business daily published on Friday, conducted before Abe’s announcement, showed only half of major firms were telling all or some employees to work at home.As the government faced questions on how businesses would cope with a March shutdown of schools, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co said they were still discussing how their factories would deal with school closures. The operator of Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea said it would close the theme parks from Saturday through March 15.“We will continue to urge public services and private companies to make it easier for people to take time off,�� Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference, without disclosing further details.Abe has come under fire for what critics say is a lack of leadership as the number of cases in Japan rose and a package of steps announced on Tuesday that was seen as insufficient.He also caught flak in parliament and social media after revelations that an aide had held a buffet-style fund-raising party with about 200 attendees on Feb. 26 - the same day the premier asked for sports and cultural events to be scaled down.Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University’s Japan campus, said Abe’s move on schools was plainly political in the wake of surveys showing growing public dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of the outbreak.“Suddenly, he sees the political consequences of being seen as missing in action,�� Kingston said, noting his support had fallen to around 36% in a weekend poll.“It’s still half measures - stay home, wash your hands, avoid other people. He’s outsourcing responsibility to local governments and corporations,�� Kingston said.Experts also questioned the efficacy of the government’s move on schools.“This is one example of a nationwide plan that has a slim chance of succeeding because the extent the coronavirus has spread differs across regions,�� Kentaro Iwata, a professor specialising in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, tweeted.He added that it “made no sense�� to close schools outside of Hokkaido.Meanwhile World Health Organization officials said they were working closely with organisers of the Tokyo Olympic Games and did not believe any decision would be taken soon on whether to hold the event starting in July as planned.

NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N dispatched its top brass, including Chief Executive Alan Mulally, to major U.S. cities on Tuesday to promote the 2013 Fusion, its redesigned family sedan that takes aim at Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Camry.The second-largest U.S. automaker began shipping the Fusion, which boasts a more athletic design and more fuel economy options, to dealers last week. Ford hopes the third-generation Fusion, coupled with the new Escape crossover launched this spring, will boost its U.S. market share.The media blitz comes as Ford’s board of directors develops a succession plan for Mulally, 67. Ford is also cutting costs in Europe, where it expects to lose more than $1 billion this year. Ford’s sales in Europe fell 29 percent in August, while overall industry sales dropped 8.5 percent.“There is a tremendous decrease in demand, but we’re absolutely committed to Europe,�� Mulally said at a Fusion event in New York. “That will involve some restructuring.”The board is looking to name Mark Fields, Ford’s head of North and South America, chief operating officer, a sign that he could be the heir apparent to Mulally, a source told Reuters last week.But on Tuesday, Mulally kept a lid on the finer details of Ford’s plans for Europe and his own plans for retirement. He said Ford has a strong internal bench of potential leaders and he was “pleased to continue to serve as CEO of Ford.”�Please don’t vote me off,�� he joked to reporters.Under Mulally’s “One Ford�� plan, Ford is moving toward building more cars using fewer platforms, a move that cuts costs but allows Ford to offer more features at a lower price.The Fusion is the latest Ford car to receive a global overhaul, after the Fiesta subcompact and Focus compact car.

(Fixes name of RAV4 in headline)BEIJING, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling 160,784 RAV4 sport-utility vehicles in China to fix problems in their rear suspension.The recall covers 13,474 imported RAV4 models made from July 21, 2005 to Nov. 28, 2008 and 147,310 RAV4 models made at Toyota’s joint venture with FAW Group from Feb. 6, 2009 to Oct. 31, 2010, China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said on its website over the weekend.Earlier this month, Toyota recalled about 760,000 RAV4 vehicles in the United States for the same reason. If nuts on the rear suspension arm are not tightened properly during a rear wheel alignment service, rust could form, leading to wear and possibly cause the arm to separate, Toyota said.	-2.860681115

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co has agreed to buy a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp, taking de facto control with a $2.2 billion bet that bails out its smaller, scandal-hit rival.The deal is a lifeline for Mitsubishi Motors, which is mired in its third scandal in two decades and has had $3 billion wiped off its market value after confessing to manipulating fuel economy data.But it should also be a boost for Nissan. Japan’s second-largest car maker has struggled to make inroads into Southeast Asia, in countries like Thailand and the Philippines, where Mitsubishi’s models are popular.Mitsubishi and Nissan already cooperate on development and manufacturing with a partnership dating back to 2011, but that deal does not currently involve any cross-shareholding.Under Thursday’s deal, Mitsubishi Motors will issue new shares to Nissan at a 5.3 percent discount to Wednesday’s close, raising 237.4 billion yen ($2.18 billion).That will hand Nissan just over a third of the group - enough to wield control, under Japanese shareholding rules.Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said the two would now share and jointly develop technology, and could realize “billions�� in synergies by coordinating purchasing, plant utilization and cooperating in growth markets.“We are determined to preserve and nurture the Mitsubishi Motors brand. We will help this company address the challenges it faces, particularly in restoring consumer trust in its fuel economy performance,�� Ghosn said, addressing a joint press conference in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.Nissan will be able to nominate a third of Mitsubishi Motors�� board, which Ghosn said he believed would be led by a Nissan executive - prompting industry analysts and bankers to forecast a significant reshuffle at the top.Mitsubishi Motors admitted last month it overstated the fuel economy of at least four of its models - mini cars sold in Japan, including two sold under Nissan’s badge.That has badly hit the group, bruising a brand already losing market share and dragging its shares down over 40 percent as investors fretted over potential compensation costs.Ghosn said he had been “reassured�� by Mitsubishi Motors�� Chief Executive Osamu Masuko over the size and scope of the fuel economy troubles, which Masuko said had accelerated discussions.Mitsubishi Motors shares were untraded before closing up 16 percent at the daily limit. Nissan shares closed down 1.4 percent.Ghosn said improving performance in kei cars, a Japanese category of small cars, was one key reason for the deal. Indeed, Nissan will gain a leg up in Japan’s small car market, where it is dwarfed by Suzuki and Toyota’s Daihatsu.It will also get a lift in fast-growing Asian economies, where Mitsubishi is more readily recognized. Asia excluding China accounted for just 6.5 percent of Nissan’s global retail sales in the year to the end of March.“The biggest benefit to Nissan would be Mitsubishi’s presence in Southeast Asia,�� said Koji Endo, autos analyst at Advanced Research Japan.But the deal also leaves Nissan with a much tougher task: ensuring a turnaround at Mitsubishi, without full control.“Taking a one-third stake feels a bit like a half-measure,�� said Kiyoshi Yamanaka at T&amp;D Asset Management.“For investors, it would be cleaner if they made Mitsubishi Motors a fully owned subsidiary, as Toyota did with Daihatsu, and then took firm control of righting its governance.”An industry banker familiar with the deal dampened expectations of a full takeover. Sister companies in the sprawling Mitsubishi family are unlikely to sell, he said.Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Mitsubishi Corp, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, together with subsidiaries held roughly a 34 percent stake in the automaker before the deal. That will be diluted to around 22 percent.None have yet commented on the tie-up.Group companies bailed out Mitsubishi Motors in 2004, but had not been expected to step in this time. Mitsubishi Corp reported its first ever loss this week.Mitsubishi Motors said on Wednesday it had enough cash to weather the fuel-economy scandal - but also warned that non-compliant data may have been used to calculate the fuel economy for more of its cars than previously announced.After Mitsubishi admitted last month to manipulating fuel economy data, analysts estimated the automaker is facing up to $1 billion in compensation for its customers, along with payments to Nissan.Alliance partner Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have combined sales of about 9.3 million vehicles, approaching those of industry leaders Toyota and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.“We have the potential to be in top three,�� Ghosn said.	0.3057802328
"(Reuters) - With auto showrooms shut during the coronavirus pandemic, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors Co GM.N moved to reboot demand with seven-year, no-interest loans and programs allowing customers to buy vehicles online.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's FCHA.MIFCAU.N new ""Drive Forward"" marketing program includes online shopping tools that will for the first time allow U.S. customers to complete the purchase of a vehicle through an FCA dealer without setting foot in a dealership, a company spokesman said.The move toward online sales and home delivery breaks with a long U.S. auto sector tradition of manufacturers giving franchised dealers control of sales to consumers. Dealers have fought Tesla Inc's TSLA.O efforts to sell vehicles directly to consumers through its website.GM and Fiat Chrysler’s promotions of extended, no-interest loans - made less costly by the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts - echo the “Keep America Rolling�� sales push GM launched to jump start a paralyzed consumer market after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.But the pandemic has been pulling auto retailing into the digital age, with dealerships shuttered across the country and sales likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place.FCA shares were down 4.9% to $6.84 in afternoon trading in New York after the company posted a 10% drop in first-quarter U.S. auto sales, as the pandemic hurt demand and halted production from mid-March. The company, however, did not break out sales by month.General Motors reported its first-quarter sales fell 7% because of significant declines in March, and said customers can use its existing “Shop.Click.Drive.�� program to find, purchase and arrange for home delivery of a vehicle.A GM spokeswoman said across the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands the automaker has seen two to four times greater online site visits and sales leads than before the pandemic.Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS said earlier that its U.S. sales fell 43% in March due to the pandemic. “It goes without saying that the entire world is facing a tremendous challenge that is having a significant impact on business and our normal way of life,�� Randy Parker, vice president for sales at Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said its sales were down nearly 37% in March and 8.8% for the quarter. Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T reported a 27% drop in first-quarter sales.FCA said its “Drive Forward program�� allows customers to complete the entire vehicle purchase process online.The system allows consumers to buy vehicles off dealer lots, trade in their old vehicle and apply for a car loan, FCA said.The company also said that as of April 1 customers can take advantage of 0% interest loans for 84 months and make no payments for 90 days on select 2019 and 2020 model vehicles.Fiat said momentum in the first two months of the year was offset as the virus hit the economy in March. Its Ram pickup trucks were a bright spot as their sales rose 7% versus the first quarter of 2019."	2.444406722

"NOIDA, India (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will start talks this week with its affiliate Daihatsu Motor 7262.T to build and sell small cars in India, where it has so far struggled to crack the cheaper end of the market. The Japanese carmaker aims to double its share of India's passenger vehicle market to 10 percent by 2025 and Daihatsu's small cars will be key to achieving this goal, a company executive said. The launch of Daihatsu cars in India could help Toyota increase its share of the entry-level, no-frills car sector, that accounts for about two-thirds of total sales in the country and is dominated by rivals such as Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS, Hyundai 005380.KS and Honda 7267.T. ""To fight in the small car market we need more support from Daihatsu ... Toyota by ourselves cannot develop it,"" Kyoichi Tanada, Toyota's CEO of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa told Reuters in an interview. The comments by the world's biggest carmaker are a tacit admission that it has failed to win over India's cost-conscious car buyers more than two decades after it started selling cars in Asia's third-largest economy. A decision on when Daihatsu cars will be brought to India will likely to be taken before the end of this year, Tanada said in an interview at India's biggest motoring event on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi. Toyota is to buy its remaining stake in Daihatsu as part of its push into compact cars for emerging markets such as India, which is expected to expand to become the world's third-largest car market by 2020 from fifth place now. ""In a market like India there is still need for small cars. As soon as possible I would like to introduce that small car,"" Tanada said. He said Toyota would also need to consider the Indian government's policy on safety and environmental issues before deciding which models to launch and when. Toyota launched its first no-frills car, the Etios sedan, in 2010 and, a year later, the Liva hatchback. In trying to control costs and keep the price low, the company was criticized for compromising on quality and finish. Sales did not take off as expected, hurting plant utilization levels. Toyota will propose to Daihatsu to use part of the carmakers plant in southern India to build vehicles rather than setting up its own facility, Tanada said, adding that Toyota can spare about half, or 100,000 units a year, of manufacturing capacity. Another challenge for Toyota will be low awareness about the Daihatsu brand in India. To save spending on creating brand awareness and setting up a separate sales network, Tanada says it could consider selling Daihatsu cars under the Toyota brand. To avoid diluting its premium brand image in India, Toyota could look at a sales and dealership strategy similar to rival Maruti Suzuki, which sells its premium models through a separate network of dealerships called Nexa. Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T, that controls Maruti Suzuki, said its position in India and other markets is under serious threat from Toyota's buyout of Daihatsu."	-5.582290664

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Thursday said it was recalling a total of about 2.9 million vehicles in Japan, China, Oceania and other regions including its Corolla Axio sedan and RAV4 SUV crossover due to potentially faulty airbag inflators.Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, Mitsubishi Motors Corp and truck maker Hino Motors also recalled a total of about 240,000 vehicles in the domestic market over inflators made by Takata Corp which can explode after prolonged exposure to hot conditions.At least 16 deaths have been linked to exploding Takata inflators, mainly in the United States, prompting the auto industry’s biggest-ever global recall.Global transport authorities consider Takata inflators containing the chemical compound ammonium nitrate to be unsafe if used without a drying agent, and have ordered all of the about 100 million on the market to be withdrawn.The Japanese automakers said that the latest recalls were part of a wider recall of Takata inflators ordered by global transport authorities last year.Toyota said that recalls were issued for about 1.16 million vehicles sold in Oceania, the Middle East and the automaker’s smaller markets, nearly one-third of total, while about 750,000 vehicles had been recalled in Japan.Vehicles sold in North America, Toyota’s biggest market, were exempt from the latest recall, it added.Takata is currently seeking a financial sponsor to help pay for the costs related to the recalls. Last month, it pleaded guilty to a U.S. felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement over its faulty inflators.	-0.2946050451
MADRID, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Spain’s antitrust regulator CNC said on Wednesday it is investigating possible price-fixing activity in the country by some of the world’s largest car firms.The probe will look at potential price-fixing and the sharing of market-sensitive data between dozens of Spanish affiliates of, amongst others, Volkswagen, Renault , Peugeot, Fiat, Nissan, Toyota, Honda and General Motors.“These are considered very serious (alleged offences) that could lead to fines of up to 10 percent of total (Spanish) annual turnover,�� the CNC said in a statement.	-0.2387774594
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's three biggest carmakers are expanding a huge global recall triggered by potentially fatal air bags made by Takata Corp 7312.T, saying on Wednesday they will take back millions of vehicles worldwide for investigation.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said they are recalling some 6.5 million vehicles globally, while Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T said it would follow suit, without giving details. A U.S. Honda spokesman added, however, that any potential action would not affect cars that were sold in the United States.Wednesday’s announcements raise to roughly 31 million the number of vehicles recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata air bag inflators, which can erupt with too much force, spraying shrapnel inside the car.The Takata-linked recalls top the largest U.S. recall of 21 million vehicles by Ford Motor Co F.N in the 1980s for a parking gear problem, according to U.S. safety regulators and safety advocates. General Motors GM.N recalled about 30 million vehicles last year, but those were for a range of defects, including faulty ignition switches. U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said Toyota and Nissan as well as Japanese government officials have been in contact with the U.S. safety agency over the last few days, and NHTSA will soon announce “significant new steps�� related to accelerating Takata recalls.“While precise root cause remains undetermined, the clear association with high humidity has suggested that moisture and time are factors in this defect,�� Trowbridge said.Asked about the latest recalls, a Takata spokeswoman said a probe into the causes for the air bag defects was ongoing and that the company continued to cooperate with the automakers.Six deaths have been linked to the defective Takata airbags, all on cars made by Honda, which announced disappointing profit forecasts last month citing high quality-related costs.Toyota and Nissan said their recalls were precautionary and that no accidents or injuries had been reported.They did not give further details about the suspected defects, but in documents submitted to Japan’s transport ministry, the automakers said they had identified problems with inflators that were not sufficiently sealed and that were at risk of allowing in moisture during extended use.Toyota, Japan’s biggest automaker, said it would recall just under 5 million Corolla, Vitz and other models, mostly in Japan and Europe.Many of the models were built between March 2003 and November 2007, and include 1.36 million to be recalled in Japan.Nissan said it was recalling about 1.56 million cars globally over the same problem. The automaker said nine models in Japan were affected, including the X-Trail SUV, Fuga sedan and Isuzu Como van. It did not immediately provide details on models affected in other markets.Takata faces multiple class action lawsuits in the United States and Canada as well as a U.S. criminal investigation and a regulatory probe.The company said last week it expects to return to profit in the business year started in April even though it has made few provisions for costs related to the massive global recall.	-0.8271116967

"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - In a country where owning a car has long been a symbol of luxury and success, around 85 percent of Chinese car buyers still buy cars with cash.But people like Chinese accountant Grace Mi and her peers in their 20s and 30s are changing the car financing game and are the ones catching the attention of global carmakers looking to boost revenue and defend margins in an increasingly competitive market.These young people are willing to buy big-ticket items like a car on credit - a behavior unheard of some 15 years ago in China - and have led carmakers to boost their financing units in the mainland.The push by automakers to steer more people to buy on credit comes as part of their broader efforts to make up for sliding margins on new-car sales in China where more companies are cutting prices to entice buyers. Other key revenue sources include maintenance and repairs, vehicle leasing and sales of accessories and parts.Mi, a 27-year-old accountant in Beijing, did not have enough cash on hand to outright buy her dream car, a Nissan Sylphy, with a price tag of about 150,000 yuan ($24,200). Instead, she saved enough money for a down payment and took out a loan.“I didn’t want to take a penny from my retired parents,�� Mi said, adding that owning a car had become increasingly important for her personal and work life. “I didn’t have to wait for years to own a car.”Mi has been repaying 2,500 yuan, or one-fourth of her monthly wage, since November for her Sylphy. While the loan payments are not small, she says she doesn’t feel burdened.“Accountants are needed everywhere so I’m not worried about job security. I don’t think I am enslaved by the car loan.”Around 70 percent of car buyers in the United States and other developed countries take out loans, according to a Deloitte report in 2012 and the reason global carmakers are trying to seize on the rise in auto financing in China is because the sector is highly profitable.The financing unit of Ford Motor Co F.N contributed nearly a quarter of the Deerborn, Michigan-based company's overall profit last year while rival GM saw 12 percent of its profit come from its finance unit.“China’s car market remains primarily a cash market, but it is starting to move to credit,�� John Lawler, head of Ford’s operations in China, told Reuters in an interview. “It’s a demographic and generational phenomenon. Those people who finance cars are primarily younger buyers.”China’s central bank gave the sector a boost in early June when it cut the amount of money auto financing firms need to set aside as reserves in a bid to stimulate the economy which is showing signs of slowing.Global carmakers have been funding their financial units�� expansion by selling off their loans in the form of asset-backed securities to beef up their operations in China. That frees up money they can use to lend to Chinese consumers.So far this year, the financing units of Ford, BMW BMWG.DE, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T have each issued around 800 million yuan ($128.85 million) of asset-backed securities.The country’s automobile association forecast the auto financing industry to more than double to 525 billion yuan ($84.55 billion) by 2025.In an email to Reuters, GMAC-SAIC Automotive Finance Co Ltd, the financing joint venture of General Motors Co GM.N in China, said auto financing will be ""integral in facilitating sales"" in the world's biggest auto market.Bankers and analysts say the chances of car loan defaults are limited in China because the country requires a large down payment - 20 percent for new cars. Consumers here also have a higher savings rate compared with other countries like the United States.“It is viewed as a future source of income rather than a source of default and losses,�� said Patrick Steinemann, co-head of Asia Industrials Investment Banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.Indeed, GM’s China chief, Matt Tsien, said financing has proved a “steady business�� in China.“One of the characteristics in the Chinese market that’s very good for the financing business is that default rates tend to be very low,�� he told Reuters in Detroit. “So the risks are pretty good in that sense. People tend to pay up,�� Tsien said.Such a rapid expansion in auto financing does have risks, coming at a time when worries are mounting over the country’s corporate and government debt. These include the fact that, relatively, Chinese consumers have a short credit history.One executive at Toyota said the Japanese carmaker has encountered some fraud cases involving fake IDs that first appeared about a year ago in southern China and then began spreading to other parts of the country.Toyota uses a set of risk assessment tools modeled around those used in other countries and refined to local practices in China that are being used by global carmakers, two Toyota executives said. Both declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak the media.Toyota has further beefed up its loan assessment process and on occasions turn to the old-style approach of home visits, they added.“Home visits are still the most direct way of verifying customer addresses, but due to time and labor requirements we can only use it sparingly,�� one of the executives said.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, the world's biggest automaker, plans to move production of its Corolla compact cars to a new factory in Mexico from Canada to benefit from lower costs, the Globe and Mail reported, citing sources familiar with the situation.Costs at Toyota’s assembly plants at Cambridge and Woodstock in Ontario are higher than at its U.S. factories and it makes sense to produce the more expensive vehicles in Canada, the newspaper quoted sources familiar with the matter as saying.Sources told Reuters that Toyota will spend $1 billion to build a car factory in Mexico, which is expected to begin functioning from the summer of 2019, ending a self-imposed three-year freeze on new investments. Toyota also plans to announce a new car factory in Guangzhou, China, this week.Toyota’s plant in Cambridge, Ontario is expected to produce larger vehicles after the Mexican plant begins production, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the situation.Representatives of Toyota in Canada were not immediately available for comment.	0.208513086

Nov 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling about 150,000 Tacoma mid-size pickup trucks from the model years 2001 to 2004 in cold-weather U.S. states because the spare tire could fall off.The spare tire in these Tacoma models is stored beneath the trucks�� bed. When the trucks were made, the metal plate that keeps the spare tire in place was not coated with sufficient amounts of phosphate to retard rust, Toyota said.Over time and in limited cases, corrosion of the plate could cause it to break, causing the detachment of the spare tire, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. said in a statement issued on Wednesday.The 150,000 trucks involved in the recall were initially sold in one of 20 cold-weather U.S. states, Toyota said.Letters will go to the owners of the recalled vehicles in December, Toyota said.Toyota dealers will replace the spare tire assembly, if necessary, without charge to Tacoma owners.	6.50624927
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it would recall 57,000 vehicles globally to replace potentially deadly air bags made by Takata Corp, in a sign that the safety crisis surrounding the Japanese auto parts maker is far from contained.Toyota’s action follows a recall by rival Honda Motor Co for the same problem two weeks ago after revelations of a fifth death, in Malaysia, caused by Takata’s air bag inflator.More than 16 million vehicles have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata’s air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray metal fragments inside the car.Subject to Toyota’s latest recall are the Vitz subcompact, called the Yaris in some markets, as well as RAV4 crossovers made between December 2002 and March 2004. About 40,000 of those are in Japan, with Europe accounting for about 6,000. The recall does not cover North America, Toyota said.Toyota said it was not aware of any injuries or deaths related to the recalled vehicles.Separately, Toyota’s small-car unit Daihatsu Motor Co filed a recall of 27,571 Mira models in Japan for the same problem, marking its first Takata air bag-related recall, a Japanese transport ministry official said.Takata-related recalls are almost certain to balloon after U.S. safety regulators on Wednesday ordered the company to expand its regional recall of driver-side air bags to cover the entire United States instead of only hot and humid areas.Takata has so far resisted expanding the recall, saying that could divert replacement parts away from the high-humidity regions that need them most.	3.443514984
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Foreign automakers in China may struggle to dictate sales goals in the future after dealers complained to the government that inflexible targets set during a market boom obliged them to buy too much stock and bear the brunt of a drop in demand.Automakers largely stuck to targets throughout 2014, selling cars to dealers on schedule. But dealers slashed retail prices and booked losses as sales growth in the world’s biggest auto market halved from the previous year’s 14 percent.“Carmakers have high market expectations. But the reality is: supply exceeds demand,�� said Luo Lei, deputy secretary general of the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).“In the past, dealers were angry, but dared not speak out. But now, they have to shout because the situation is getting so unbearable,�� said Luo, whose body this month filed a report with authorities on the practice of transferring stock to dealers.The report from China’s biggest dealer body could help change the balance of power at a time when automakers are starting to alter expectations in an economy expanding near its slowest rate in 24 years.Japan’s Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan Motor Co Ltd cut their China sales forecasts last month while executives say Toyota Motor Corp is likely to miss its 2014 goal. Germany’s BMW said it expects profit margins to narrow as the market “normalizes�� from the growth spurt of the past few years.“Carmakers are making a compromise to dealers�� in their worst-ever spat, said Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.“Over the past years, carmakers, especially luxury brands, have been too aggressive in their quest for China market share. Now with the problem fully exposed, I expect to see an obvious slowdown in their pace of expansion next year.”Honda has been helping dealers “adjust�� inventories since the middle of the year, a company spokesman said. Honda’s China sales have fallen every month since July.BMW China head Karsten Engel said in an interview last month that the luxury carmaker had “listened�� to dealers saying stockpiles were building up, and that it had started “reducing wholesale supplies��.The reduction contributed to BMW’s sales growth slowing to 8 percent in the third quarter from over 20 percent in the first half.BMW in a statement said it is in continuous dialogue with dealers about all aspects of business development including targets, and that it is in its interest for dealers to be profitable.In its report to the government, CADA said automakers have “excessive power�� as their targets essentially obligate dealers to buy their cars. That means automakers still earn a profit whereas dealers suffer “rampant losses�� because of an inability to sell excess stock to consumers, CADA said.In separate reports, CADA said 30 percent of dealers profited this year compared with 70 percent in 2010, and that inventories were equivalent to 1.8 times monthly sales, above the “alert line�� of 1.5. A stockpile of 0.8 times to 1.2 times is generally considered healthy, industry analysts say.The Jiangsu Automobile Trade Management Association this month said 30 of 34 FAW Toyota dealerships in the eastern province were losing money, partly because they were obliged to buy a set number of cars from FAW Toyota or face penalty fees.Toyota venture FAW Toyota Motor Sales Co said in a statement posted on the Jiangsu association’s website that it had lowered sales targets and slowed the pace of network expansion in eastern China to protect dealers�� profitability.“For a long period of time, manufacturers have been in a dominant position,�� said Chen Ning, deputy secretary general of the Jiangsu association. “We haven’t yet seen any improvements in dealers�� situation. Many of them are still struggling on the verge of survival.��	2.685686962
(Adds CFO telling analysts company wants to pay recall costs by installments)TOKYO/BEIJING, May 14 (Reuters) - Takata Corp will not set aside more cash to pay for an expanding car recall linked to its air bag inflators because the defect cited by automakers was not “officially recognized,�� analysts cited its chief financial officer as saying.Takata CFO Yoichiro Nomura was speaking to analysts Thursday at a company briefing that was closed to the media, but two analysts told Reuters the executive said he saw no reason to set aside more cash.Nomura also said Takata had asked automakers to accept installment payments from the supplier for recall costs, according to the analysts who spoke with Reuters.Earlier, Honda Motor Co and Daihatsu Motor Co said they would recall more than 5 million cars to replace potentially fatal air bag inflators made by Takata, a day after Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co said they were taking back 6.5 million vehicles.

Two teams nearly at opposite ends of the Western Conference table in MLS play, yet both with similar senses of urgency, square off Saturday when Minnesota United travels to FC Dallas.Kickoff is 7 p.m. CT at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.Dallas (12-5-6, 42 points) sits on top of the standings, but has lost two straight matches and holds only a three-point advantage over second place Sporting Kansas City.Minnesota (9-13-2, 29 points), sits ninth, six points away from a possible playoff berth.With the playoffs drawing closer, both teams need wins.Dallas, which lost to last-place San Jose 3-1 on Aug. 4 in their last home game, still sits a stellar 7-1-4 at home this year, the best mark in the West.That doesn’t bode well for Minnesota, which is 1-9-1 on the road this year -- the worst mark in the league.

* Unsure if Toyota will invest more if political crisis is prolonged* New foreign investors may opt to shift elsewhere* 2014 industry car sales may miss target due to politicsBANGKOK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp may reconsider investing up to 20 billion baht ($609 million) in Thailand, and could even cut production, if political unrest drags on, the head of the Japanese automaker’s local unit said on Monday.Toyota is the largest car manufacturer in Thailand, producing 800,000 vehicles a year. Plans to increase its annual capacity by 200,000 vehicles a year over the next three to four years are now uncertain, Kyoichi Tanada, president of Toyota’s Thai unit, told a news conference.“Our new investment in Thailand may not happen if the current political crisis goes on longer,�� Tanada said.“For new foreign investors, the political situation may force them to look for opportunity elsewhere. For those that have already invested, like Toyota, we will not go away. But whether we will invest (further) or not, we are unsure.”Thailand is the biggest auto market in Southeast Asia and a regional vehicle production and export base for the world’s top car manufacturers like Honda Motor Co and Ford Motor Co .Protesters have been trying for more than two months to bring down Thailand’s government, forcing ministries to close and Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to shift her workplace as part of an attempted “shutdown�� of the capital.If the unrest affects economic growth, Toyota may cut its production in Thailand while it assesses the situation, Tanada said.“After the shutdown, we have fewer visitors going to our showrooms. We are ready to cut down our car output if we are affected by the political situation,�� he added.Toyota produced around 850,000 cars in Thailand in 2013, selling 445,000 domestically and exporting some 430,000 vehicles. This year, it aims to sell 400,000 cars domestically and export 445,000, Tanada said.Overall auto industry sales in Thailand are expected to fall 13.6 percent to 1.15 million vehicles in 2014, mainly due to weaker consumption and slow economic growth, data from Toyota’s Thai unit shows.This will be the second consecutive year of decline after an 80 percent surge in 2012 fuelled by government subsidies for first-time car buyers and pent-up demand after severe flooding in late 2011.Domestic auto sales fell 7.7 percent to 1.33 million vehicles in 2013, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).	-4.258675079
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly two dozen U.S. state governors, including those of California and New York, urged the Trump administration on Tuesday to abandon a proposal to freeze fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026.The list of 23 states and Puerto Rico includes key 2020 election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.In August 2018, the administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements and stripping California of the right to set its own vehicle-emissions rules.The governors, representing 52% of the U.S. population and 57% of the economy, said they want “continuous, meaningful annual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants while saving consumers money,�� and that they “support preserving state authority to protect our residents from vehicle pollution.”Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler told reporters on Monday the agency “will be coming out later this summer with our (fuel efficiency) standards, which will also further reduce CO2.”The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and others, said on Tuesday: ""It is untenable to face a marketplace with different standards in different states, but it is also untenable to face standards that rise so high that only a handful of electric cars can achieve them.""The group again said it was “urging the federal government and states to find a middle ground that raises standards year over year while aligning with market demand.”The final regulation faces a multi-year legal battle that could leave automakers in limbo about future emissions and fuel-efficiency requirements.The Trump administration plan aims to roll back emission standards set by former President Barack Obama.The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration’s preferred option.Last month, 17 major automakers urged a compromise “midway�� between the Obama-era standards that require annual decreases of about 5% in emissions and the Trump administration’s proposal.Reuters reported in April that officials expect the final rule will include a small increase in yearly fuel-efficiency requirements.Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat, said since the White House had shown no interest in new talks that “automakers should make clear that they will not support this rollback by working directly with California and these 23 states.”Automakers and government officials say they do not expect EPA and the Transportation Department to finalize the rules before September."	1.256084158
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE will resume producing cars in Kenya by the end of the year as it looks to sell more vehicles across the East African region.After a four decade pause in production by the German carmaker in Kenya, VW will establish an assembly plant to initially produce its Vivo model, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Thomas Schafer, Volkswagen South Africa’s chief executive, said.Emerging market production is familiar territory for VW, whose familiar Beetle model was a favorite on the streets of Mexico, but Kenya’s car market is dominated by low-priced second-hand imports from countries such as Japan.VW, which assembled cars in Kenya in the 1960s and 1970s, will join other brands already being put together in the country, including Isuzu 7202.T, Toyota 7203.T, Nissan 7201.T and Mitsubishi 8058.T. “Volkswagen South Africa will now again establish an assembly plant to produce motor vehicles at the Kenya Motor Vehicle Manufacturers limited in Thika,�� Kenyatta said on Wednesday after meeting Volkswagen South Africa executives.Kenya mostly assembles trucks, pick-ups and buses from kits supplied by foreign manufacturers, although data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics showed that the number of vehicles assembled between January and April was down 31 percent year-on-year to 2,258 vehicles.The Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers Association (KVMA) attributed the slowdown to tough economic conditions for buyers, including high interest rates and cuts in government spending, while VW said it saw opportunity in the market.“We believe that Kenya has got the potential to develop a very big fully-fledged automotive industry. The East African Community has got the potential, and today is the first step in this direction that we want to take with our passenger cars,�� Schafer said.VW is the second-biggest auto maker by sales in South Africa after Toyota 7203.T with its vehicles sold domestically as well as exported to the rest of Africa.Kenyatta said that VW’s assembly plant would begin with the Vivo and expand to a range of vehicles, with the first car expected to be rolled out before the end of the year.Neither Kenyatta nor Schafer said how much VW was investing or what the plant’s production capacity would be.	-3.793074952
NAGOYA (Reuters) - As Toyota 7203.T prepares to nearly halve production at Japanese factories, a regional governor said on Thursday he would offer 400 billion yen ($3.72 billion) in emergency loans for small and mid-size companies including Toyota's suppliers.Toyota Motor Corp’s headquarters are in Aichi Prefecture, at Toyota City, which was named after the company in the 1950s to reflect its role as the biggest employer in the region.��(Toyota is) not only the backbone of Aichi prefecture’s economy but all of Japan,�� Aichi governor Hideaki Ohmura told Reuters, adding that it kept valuable manufacturing jobs in Japan while other companies exported their factories abroad.Japan is a major production hub for Toyota and its domestic manufacturing network is heavily concentrated in Aichi, Japan’s industrial heartland where more than 40% of the cars built in Japan are made.Toyota and its affiliates operate more than half of Aichi’s plants.Ohmura said Toyota and its top tier suppliers supported more than 55,000 jobs in the region and thousands more through smaller suppliers.“We need to be able to support the demand when there’s a rebound and to do that we need to properly support the auto companies�� small and medium suppliers,�� he said.He said his proposal for the 400 billion yen in loans would be part of a package of measures the prefectural assembly was due to adopt on Friday.Toyota has said it expects to produce 40% fewer cars than initially planned in May after it began to significantly reduce output at its Japanese plants this month, due to plummeting demand for export models including those shipped to the United States and the Middle East due to the coronavirus.Toyota has said it will stop production on a staggered basis through mid-May at five of its domestic plants which produce high-volume models including the Prius gasoline hybrid, the Corolla hatchback and the Camry sedan.For years, Toyota has pledged to maintain an annual domestic production level of 3 million vehicles, roughly one-third of its global output, in Japan to support jobs and hone manufacturing skills.More than 11,500 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Japan and nearly 300 have died. Aichi has had 443 confirmed cases.Manufacturing plants in Japan have been permitted to keep operating during the outbreak, and the powerful auto lobby has said it would try to avoid suspending output while prioritising worker safety.Automakers and their suppliers are also considering industry-led financial support for struggling firms.	1.264686684
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to delay a decision on imposing tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months, three Trump administration officials told Reuters, , avoiding opening yet another front in his global trade battles.A formal announcement is expected by Saturday, the due date for Trump to make a decision on recommendations by the Commerce Department to protect the U.S. auto industry from imports on national security grounds, the officials said.A White House spokesman declined to comment.They added that the administration has drafted language to formally delay a decision on the tariffs that is due by May 18.Reuters reported last week that automakers expected Trump to delay the decision as trade negotiations get underway with the European Union and Japan.General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp and others have warned of the damaging impacts of imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts.The White House has held a series of high-level meetings on the issue in recent days, and administration officials have repeatedly told automakers they planned to delay the decision.In February, the Commerce Department submitted its “Section 232�� national security report to the White House. The agency was investigating whether imports harmed U.S. national security by weakening American automakers�� ability to invest in future technologies. The Commerce Department’s specific recommendations have not been revealed.A series of announcements by GM last week of $700 million in investments in three Ohio plants and efforts to sell the company’s closed Lordstown plant had made Trump more inclined to delay the tariffs, administration officials told Reuters last week.At the same time, Trump has escalated his trade war with China, sharply increasing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and launching public consultations on remaining Chinese imports of about $300 billion.The auto tariffs face wide opposition in Congress. The White House has refused to turn over the Commerce Department report to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who has been demanding to see it.Last week, 159 House of Representatives members led by Ways and Means Committee Vice Chair Terri Sewell wrote White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow to urge him to advise Trump against “imposing trade restrictions that could harm the auto sector and the American economy.”The letter from 79 Democrats and 81 Republicans, which was seen by Reuters, warned that imposing tariffs on parts in cars “may overlap with motorcycles, recreational vehicles, construction equipment, heavy-duty trucks, farming equipment, powersports vehicles, and others.”Administration officials have said tariff threats on autos are a way to win concessions from Japan and the EU. Last year, Trump agreed not to impose tariffs as long as talks with the two trading partners were proceeding in a productive manner.The industry says tariffs of up to 25 percent on millions of imported cars and parts would add thousands of dollars to vehicle costs and potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses throughout the U.S. economy.“The case remains clear �� cars are not a national security threat,�� the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, VW, Toyota and other producers, said in a statement. “We are deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs.”An auto industry research report released last year estimated that U.S. light-duty vehicle prices would increase by $2,750 on average, including U.S.-built vehicles, reducing annual U.S. sales by 1.3 million units and forcing many consumers to the used-car market.	3.561301084
TOKYO (Reuters) - Subaru Corp 7270.T lowered its annual profit forecast on expectations of a stronger yen and the impact on production from a typhoon last month, driving its shares down as much as 4.5%.Japan's smallest major automaker, which is owned a fifth by top-ranked Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, cut its forecast for operating profit to 220 billion yen ($2 billion) for the year ending March 2020, from a previous forecast of 260 billion yen.Subaru revised its forecast for the yen to average 107 versus the dollar over the period, from 110 previously.A stronger currency eats into profits because cars exported from Japan become more expensive and the value of earnings made overseas decreases.The United States is Subaru’s biggest market, accounting for about 60% of overall sales.Typhoon Hagibis forced Subaru to halt production at its factories in Gumna, north of Tokyo, for more than a week in October due to supply chain disruptions.The stoppage, which lasted until Oct. 25, resulted in lost production of 11,000 vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Tomomi Nakamura told a briefing in Tokyo on Wednesday.Hagibis was the worst typhoon to hit Japan in decades, leaving at least 80 people dead, according to national broadcaster NHK.“We have restarted production, but we couldn’t return to full capacity immediately,�� Nakamura said.“Some of our suppliers�� factories were completely submerged.”Subaru also said vehicle sales rose nearly 20% in the first half of the fiscal year compared with a year earlier, driven almost entirely by an improvement in the United States amid strong demand for the Forester SUV crossover.Subaru shares were down 1% at 3,102 yen by 0440 GMT, after touching a low of 2,995.5 yen earlier.	1.709767044

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)The weakening yen is good news for Japan’s automakers. The more than 20 percent drop in the currency’s value against the dollar since early October will boost profit from overseas sales �� and probably market share, too. A return to the glory days of 2006, though, is likely to prove elusive.Back then, Toyota’s market value was greater than the combined worth of its eight major western rivals �� Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Renault, Peugeot, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen. Though the yen may be heading back towards 115 to the dollar, as it was then, virtually everything else has changed.Seven years ago, Chrysler, GM and Ford were a mess. Now all three companies are back on the road, the first two with the help of a government bailout. They are earning decent money after slashing costs and cranking out better vehicles.The strong yen of recent years also prompted Japan’s big three automakers to shift more production overseas. Some two thirds of the cars that Nissan and Toyota sell in North America are now made there, while for Honda the ratio is 90 percent. That reduces the benefit of being able to export Japanese-made cars at a lower exchange rate.The weakening currency still provides some fillip. At 100 yen to the dollar, Japanese automakers�� top lines will receive a $2,000 boost for each car they sell in the United States, according to Morgan Stanley. How the manufacturers use this benefit will be crucial. Simply allowing it to accrue to the bottom line would flatter earnings, but may tempt executives to put efforts to cut costs on hold.Offering discounts to U.S. buyers would risk starting a price war which would hurt American carmakers�� bottom lines, but carry no guarantee of a market-share shift. Using some of the currency benefit to add more features to cars could be more effective, though it may take several years for the effects to show in market share and profit.The final option is to boost dividends or investment. Expectations of increased largesse have already sent Japanese auto stocks up some 70 percent since October. Absent another big drop in the yen, though, there doesn’t seem to be enough horsepower left to take Toyota up by another third to its 2006 high.	6.336325967
BEIJING, May 28 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co, Japan’s No.2 automaker, will start making Infiniti cars at a 2-billion-yuan ($315 million) plant in China from 2014 as it moves to challenge the dominance of German rivals in the world’s largest auto market.Chinese-made Infiniti cars would put Nissan on a more level playing field with Audi AG, Mercedes Benz and BMW AG , which have been making cars in China for years, industry observers say. Imported Infiniti cars have been available in China since 2007.“It’s a necessary step if Infiniti wants a bigger share of the Chinese market,�� said Jenny Gu, a manager with industry consultancy LMC Automotive.“Local production would provide the volume it needs to catch up with the German brands and help to offset a rising yen�� that makes cars imported from Japan more expensive, Gu said.In a statement, Nissan said two Infiniti models - which have yet to be named - would be produced at a factory jointly operated with Dongfeng Motor Group, that makes Teana and Murano models.The facility in Xiangyang city in central China would have an initial capacity of 130,000 vehicles, rising to 250,000 eventually, it added.Nissan sold about 19,000 Infiniti cars in China in the last fiscal year that ended in March, a fraction of the more than 300,000 cars market leader Audi delivered in the whole of 2011.Nissan’s mid-term growth plan targets sales of 500,000 Infiniti vehicles globally by 2016, and the company has said China would account for a large portion of that growth.“The localization of Infiniti at our Xiangyang plant is a significant milestone for us,�� said Kimiyasu Nakamura, president of Dongfeng Motor Co, Nissan’s joint venture with Dongfeng.“It proves that we are fully capable of producing luxury vehicles of the highest quality standards here in China, at the same level of quality as the Tochigi plant, its mother plant, in Japan.”Early in the month, Infiniti relocated its global headquarters from Yokohama, Japan, to Hong Kong, a gateway to mainland China.Nissan outsold Toyota Motor Corp to become the top Japanese light-vehicle brand in China last year for the first time, according to research firm LMC Automotive.The Infiniti plant would spear Nissan further ahead of Toyota and Honda Motor Co in China’s luxury car segment, which Daimler chief executive Dieter Zetsche said could continue to grow 15-20 percent in 2012 after years of breakneck expansion.Other luxury car makers, such as General Motors and Honda, are also playing catch-up, hoping to grab a bigger share of the Chinese market.GM chief executive Dan Akerson expects Cadillac’s China sales to match U.S. sales levels by 2015 or 2016.PSA Peugeot Citroen &lt;PEUP.PA) in late April unveiled a sleek, large coupe-styled sedan, a precursor to the Citroen DS luxury sub-brand it plans to introduce to China from June 28, with an annual volume target of 200,000 vehicles within four years.Most Infiniti models are made in Japan. To help achieve its goal to triple global sales of its premium brand by 2016 and avoid foreign exchange risks, Nissan also plans to localise Infiniti production in the United States and Europe	1.284879948

DETROIT, July 24 (Reuters) - The Porsche brand, for the ninth straight year, led J.D.

Audi, BMW, Land Rover and Toyota’s Lexus followed Porsche, which like Audi is a unit of Volkswagen AG.General Motors�� Cadillac brand, which finished seventh, was the highest ranking U.S. brand. Lincoln, a division of Ford Motor Co, came in ninth.The influential survey asks more than 83,000 drivers to rate the experience of owning and driving a vehicle during the first 90 days after they bought or leased it. The responses were gathered between February and May, 2013.Ram, Chrysler LLC’s truck division, was the highest-rated non-luxury brand.The Land Rover Range Rover was the top scoring vehicle in the entire survey, based on 77 different attributes which measure how satisfied drivers are with their vehicle. This year is the first time a large premium car didn’t claim the survey’s top spot.Volkswagen AG had the most segment winners with five vehicles from all its brands receiving high marks. Chevrolet had the highest number of segment award winners for any brand with three -- Avalanche, Sonic and Volt.Daimler AG’s Smart unit was the lowest-ranked brand in the survey. Toyota, Jeep, Subaru and Mitsubishi were also in the bottom five.	-1.850254802
NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors are trying to determine whether Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp misled U.S. regulators about the number of defective airbags it sold to automakers including Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.According to the paper, the investigation is in its very early stages.

PARIS (Reuters) - Japanese automakers, battered by a strong yen, are hunkering down in a stormy Europe, taking tentative steps to stand up to their aggressive South Korean rivals, in a market they see as challenging, but worth the effort.All Japanese carmakers' sales declined in Western Europe in the eight months to August from a year ago, ranging from Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T 0.9 percent dip to Mitsubishi Motors' 7211.T 34.5 percent tumble.That compares with South Korean Hyundai Motor's 005380.KS 9.3 percent rise and its affiliate Kia Motors' 000270.KS 25.1 percent jump, as aggressive marketing of their stylish, affordable cars paid off, helped by a weak won and a free trade agreement between South Korea and the European Union.Hyundai’s market share grew to 3.2 percent in western Europe through August from 1.8 percent in 2007, while Kia’s rose to 2.4 percent from 1.5 percent.“It’s a tough region for Japanese companies to do well, and also if we use cars from Japan, of course it’s very difficult in terms of export,�� Karl Schlicht, Executive Vice President of Toyota Motor Europe said ahead of the Paris auto show, which opened to the media on Thursday.So why do Japanese carmakers bother?In fact, some don't - Daihatsu 7262.T, part of the Toyota group, will stop selling new cars in Europe in January 2013, blaming the high costs needed to meet Europe's tough environmental regulations and the strong yen.But for many automakers, Europe’s tough regulatory requirements are part of the answer.“This is where all global standards for cars are set. If we don’t fight here, we can’t fight anywhere else,�� Hiroshi Harunari, Executive Vice President of Mitsubishi, told Reuters this week.Executives cited standards such as the European Union’s Euro 5 and Euro 6, which cap permissible emissions from various kinds of vehicles.The European market may be struggling as austerity measures, high unemployment and fears about the future keep customers away from showrooms, but it still represents a major chunk of global auto sales.The 27 EU member states accounted for 19 percent of worldwide motor vehicle registrations - or 15.1 million vehicles - in 2011, data published on the website of European industry association ACEA shows.At a tough time for the region, Japanese automakers can count themselves lucky their presence in Europe is limited, said Christopher Richter, a senior analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific markets based in Tokyo.“Their exposure to the region, compared to the state of the German makers or the American makers, is very small. And given the state of economy and the state of the vehicle market there, that’s not such a bad thing.”Despite their decades-long presence, most Japanese carmakers have failed to make significant inroads in the highly competitive market, which is dominated by western brands such as Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA, Renault RENA.PA and Ford F.N.The exception is Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, which has an alliance with Renault, receiving diesel engines and manual transmissions popular in Europe from the French firm. It is the only major Japanese carmaker whose market share has grown in western Europe in the last five years.It rose to 3.4 percent in 2012 from 2.0 percent in 2007.Nissan also produces about 80 percent of products sold in Europe within the region, a higher rate than that of Toyota at around 67 percent and Honda at 60 percent.Japanese firms suffered as the yen soared to about 77 yen against a dollar from 120 yen five years ago, making it more expensive to export from Japan. Supply chains were also disrupted by the 2011 Japan earthquake and Thai floods.Honda Motor 7267.T, whose market share in Western Europe shrank to 1.0 percent in 2012 from 1.9 percent five years ago, has seen its European business lose money for three years in a row and is not optimistic about a quick recovery.Toyota, whose market share dropped to 4.2 percent from 5.8 percent in 2007, brought its European business back to profit two years ago thanks to its financial services business.In common with its peers, one of its strategies to help European operations is reducing reliance on imports. Toyota is investing $350 million to build the new Auris compact hatchback in Britain and the Corolla in Turkey.“It’s very easy to lose money here in Europe. So we have to be careful and we want to go step by step, said Toyota’s Schlicht. “There is no bravado or nobody is saying we need to do crazy things in Europe.”Toyota aims to start making money this year in European car manufacturing.Nissan is investing 900 million pounds ($1.45 billion) in projects at its Sunderland plant in Britain, including production of the Qashqai crossover, Note compact car, and the LEAF electric vehicle.Meanwhile, Mitsubishi agreed to sell a plant in the Netherlands for 1 euro to a local bus maker on condition that employees did not lose their jobs, taking care of a sluggish operation that had troubled it for years.The carmaker will start selling the Outlander SUV and the Mirage compact car in Europe soon.“We are currently on the defensive, but as we introduce new products into the market, we will also be on the offensive,�� said Mitsubishi’s Harunari. “We shouldn’t be pessimistic.��	0.5190086934
SYDNEY, May 28 (Reuters) - Australia on Monday increased the size of its biggest compulsory product recall as it said an additional 1.1 million cars fitted with Takata Corp air bags would be recalled.Australia earlier this year demanded that manufacturers of nearly 3 million vehicles that carried the air bags, linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries globally because the inflators can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles, pay for replacements.The air bags must be replaced by Dec. 31, 2020, or the manufacturers will face fines of A$1.1 million ($857,000) per breach of the order.Once complete, the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission said vehicles from manufactures including Audi , Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota would be recalled at a later, unspecified date.Pressure is growing on manufacturers globally to meet recall timetables.The U.S. auto safety agency said earlier this month it wanted to meet with 12 major automakers that failed to fulfil a December 2017 target deadline for completing repairs on the highest-priority vehicles with dangerous Takata air bag inflators.In June 2017, Takata filed for bankruptcy as it sought court protection from creditors after almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.	0.3235990529
Jones continues ascent with Truck Series titleBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeHOMESTEAD, Fla. -- With the 2015 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series title now in Erik Jones�� rear-view mirror, the immediate question becomes “What’s next for the 19-year-old prodigy?”With a relatively nondescript, problem-free sixth-place finish in Friday night’s Ford EcoBoost 200 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Jones secured the series driver’s championship as well as the owner’s title for Kyle Busch Motorsports.Discovered by Busch when he beat his future car owner as a 16-year-old in the Snowball Derby for Super Late Models, Jones delivered the championship after running two part-time seasons for KBM.“I can’t think of a better way to repay these guys,�� Jones said in Victory Lane after securing the title by 15 points over runner-up Tyler Reddick. “I can’t think of a better way to thank Kyle for all these years (than by) getting the driver’s championship for him. He’s wanted one since the company started, and to bring it home for myself and for KBM, you couldn’t really ask for a better ending than that.”The youngest champion in series history at 19 years, 5 months, 21 days, Jones has been earmarked for a meteoric ascent to the top level of NASCAR racing.“It means so much more to have the opportunity to help these younger drivers and to help these kids that are coming up through the ranks to be successful,�� Busch said.“And to do that with Kyle Busch Motorsports and Toyota, there’s nothing greater than to have that feeling and to build that company from the ground up, from nothing, and take it to where it is today.”But first things first. Team owner Joe Gibbs reiterated Friday the plan to run Jones in a full season of NASCAR Xfinity Series racing next year, with a few selected Sprint Cup events added to the mix.Jones has already gotten his baptism in Sprint Cup. Earlier this season, he subbed for Kyle Busch at Kansas, the last of 11 races Busch missed after breaking his right leg and left foot in the season-opening Xfinity Series event at Daytona.Jones filled a relief role for Denny Hamlin at Bristol in April after Hamlin’s neck locked up during a rain delay. And when Matt Kenseth received a two-race suspension for wrecking Joey Logano on Nov. 1 at Martinsville, Jones was tabbed to replace him.His first laps in a Sprint Cup car were hardly tentative. Behind the wheel of Busch’s No. 18 Toyota, he ran consistently in the top 10 before crashing on lap 196 of 267 at Kansas.Subbing for Kenseth at Texas and Phoenix, Jones qualified sixth and seventh, respectively, and finished 12th and 19th against the top stock car drivers in the world.Despite the speed he has shown in the Sprint Cup series, Jones is content to let his career take its course.“Absolutely, I think the Xfinity Series is completely necessary,�� Jones said. “I have no problem running a year there ... as long as need be there. I don’t know what the exact career path is for me down the road.“At some point, yeah, I want to race in the Cup series every weekend. I feel like there’s a plan in place for that opportunity to arise. And I’ll just keep taking what’s given to me every week and go out and try to win races.��	1.242690058

GENEVA (Reuters) - The auto industry is facing seismic changes with the rise of electric vehicles, automated driving and car sharing set to eclipse even big mergers such as PSA’s purchase of Opel, executives at the Geneva auto show said.Peugeot maker PSA Group PEUP.PA said on Monday it had agreed to buy loss-making Opel from General Motors GM.N, creating Europe's second-biggest carmaker behind Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and sparking speculation of more consolidation. However, some auto executives gathering in Geneva said the deal was unlikely to alter the landscape on its own, with changing consumer habits and new rivals in Silicon Valley and China all likely to have a much bigger impact on carmakers.“My feeling is that the industry as a whole and brand positioning will change in the next 10 or 15 years, and that comes in addition to traditional consolidation,�� said Herbert Diess, head of Volkswagen’s (VW) passenger car division.“We are really in a transitionary phase for the industry. There are new competitors on the horizon like Tesla or Chinese ventures,�� Diess told reporters, adding that he did not expect a wave of Opel-style mergers.Volkswagen (VW) is investing billions of euros in electric vehicles, automated driving and new mobility services, in part as it tries to recover from a costly emissions test cheating scandal that has hit demand for diesel vehicles.The company, which is also cutting costs, is unveiling a fully self-driving concept car at the Geneva show.Karl Schlicht, head of European sales at Japan's Toyota 7203.T, also played down the impact of the PSA-Opel deal, which brings together carmakers with a heavy focus on diesel and low-margin fleet vehicles.“We ran a counter strategy in Europe which may not look as successful for some past years because our volumes were a bit lower, but in terms of where we want to end up, it’s turning out to be a good strategy,�� he said, referring to Toyota’s investment in hybrid vehicles.Toyota forecasts its European sales will rise 5 percent this year while the market is expected to grow just 1 percent amid uncertainty over German and French elections and Britain’s departure from the European Union.BMW BMWG.DE boss Harald Krueger, however, said the cost of investments in new technologies could spur deals among smaller carmakers.‘NO SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST’Some industry analysts also say an enlarged PSA could actually ease the pressure on rivals if CEO Carlos Tavares uses similar methods to turn a profit at Opel that worked at PSA.In the three years since Tavares took the helm at PSA, its existing brands - Peugeot, Citroen and DS - have significantly increased pricing relative to benchmarked rivals, sometimes at the expense of sales.A similar approach at Opel, which has been among the region’s most aggressive discounters, could give the entire European mass-market car industry some breathing space.“The deal could then ease price pressures, lead to a stabilization, or even a recovery,�� said Michele Pedroni, fund manager at SYZ Asset Management in Geneva.GM and PSA have shared production of commercial vans and developed common vehicle platforms for years, and the Opel Crossland X and the Citroen C-Aircross concept SUV on show in Geneva are a sign of the new projects and synergies they hope to achieve as one company.Stefan Bratzel of the Center of Automotive Management in Germany said the potential improvement in profitability at PSA-Opel posed a bigger challenge to rivals than its sheer size.“There is no survival of the fattest,�� he said. “Just because you’re big, you do not win the game.”Some analysts say Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) FCHA.MI, which has less than 7 percent of the European market compared with PSA-Opel's more than 16 percent, could be among the most pressured, with its high debts and costly plants in Italy. “Being a mid-sized player in Europe and not particularly profitable in the region leaves them quite vulnerable,�� said Felipe Munoz, an automotive analyst at JATO. “They are too expensive to be bought by one of the big guys, and they are not in a position to grow unless they find a partner.”FCA boss Sergio Marchionne has long advocated mergers to share the cost of cleaner and more technologically advanced cars, but his attempt to woo GM was rebuffed and with the U.S. firm now leaving Europe that option seems even less likely.Marchionne said on Tuesday that FCA did not need a merger, but he wouldn’t rule one out and said he could approach GM again if it was the right thing to do.He also said the PSA-Opel deal might over time encourage VW to consider a tie-up with his own company, although one industry investment banker told Reuters that was unlikely as VW focuses on its transformation following the dieselgate scandal.Ford F.N, another mid-sized player in Europe, highlighted the importance of keeping costs down.European boss Jim Farley told Reuters it was “really, really important�� for the future of its more than 14,000 workers in Britain that the country strikes a tariff-free trade deal when it leaves the European Union.	-5.268336315
BEIJING, March 12 (Reuters) - Auto sales in China plunged 79.1% in February, marking their biggest ever monthly decline, as a coronavirus outbreak hit demand, data from the country’s largest auto industry association showed on Thursday.Total auto sales in China, the world’s biggest auto market, fell to 310,000 units from the same month a year earlier, declining for a twentieth straight month, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said.The number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) sold contracted for an eighth month in a row.China’s car market has been badly hurt from the outbreak that has killed more than 3,100 people in world’s No.2 economy.While some Chinese cities are offering incentives to revive car sales, auto production remains limited with car makers from Toyota Motor to Great Wall reporting big sales drops last month.CAAM estimates auto sales will drop by more than 10% in the first half of this year, a senior official at the association told Reuters last month, and around 5% for the whole year if the outbreak is effectively contained before April.The World Health Organization has classified the outbreak as a pandemic. The coronavirus has infected more than 121,000 people in 118 countries while over 4,300 people have died due to it, according to a Reuters tally.Industry sales fell 8.2% last year, pressured by new emission standards in a shrinking economy and trade tensions with the United States.

BANGKOK, July 25 (Reuters) - Thailand’s total domestic car sales are expected to be 980,000 units this year, up 12 percent from 2017, and more than previously expected, Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Wednesday.Toyota, which commands about one-third of the Thai vehicle market, also raised its own 2018 car sales in the Southeast Asian nation to 315,000 cars, up 31 percent from last year, Toyota Motor Thailand’s President Michinobu Sugata told a news conference.Sales have been supported by stronger economic growth and more activities by carmakers, he said.In January, the company predicted overall domestic sales at 900,000 cars and its own sales at 300,000 units.Thailand is a regional production and export hub for the world’s top carmakers, and the sector accounts for about 12 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.

July 24 (Reuters) - German automaker BMW is investing in Coulomb Technologies, a California-based provider of electric-vehicle charging stations and software.BMW declined to disclose the amount of the investment in Coulomb, which has EV development agreements with General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co and luxury hybrid vehicle manufacturer Fisker Automotive.Coulomb’s ChargePoint operates a global network of EV charging stations in more than 14 countries, including the United States.ChargePoint also provides EV customers, dealers and manufacturers with a variety of cloud-based services, including the ability to locate charging stations, process payments and monitor energy use and costs.The investment is being made by BMW i Ventures, the automaker’s New York City-based venture-capital arm.BMW is launching a family of electrified vehicles as part of its new i Series, beginning in 2013 with the battery-powered i3 compact.Coulomb, based in Campbell, California, in May raised $47.5 million in a new round of venture capital led by Braemar Energy Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.

BEIRUT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the former head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, on Wednesday lamented the failure of the carmakers to merge with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) , which has since combined with Peugeot (PSA) .Speaking publicly for the first since his dramatic escape from Japan at the end of 2019, Ghosn told reporters in Beirut that he had been in negotiations with John Elkann, a member of Fiat’s owning family.“In 2017, the alliance was the number one automotive group. Three companies growing, profitable. We were preparing to add Fiat Chrysler to the group because I was negotiating with John Elkann for Fiat Chrysler to join,�� he said.“I had contact with FCA. We had a lot of understanding, we have very good dialogue. Unfortunately, I was arrested before we could come to a conclusion,�� Ghosn said, adding that a meeting had been scheduled for January 2019 to try to conclude a deal.Renault-Nissan has been in management turmoil ever since Ghosn’s arrest in Tokyo in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies. He was awaiting trial in Japan when he fled to Lebanon.Fiat Chrysler and Renault did announce a $35 billion plan to merge in May 2019, when Ghosn was in detention, but the Italian-American company pulled out only 10 days after the deal was made public.The Renault-Nissan alliance has struggled to move on since the collapse of the deal, which would have created the third biggest carmaker behind Volkswagen and Toyota .“The alliance missed the unmissable, which is Fiat Chrysler. That is unbelievable, they go with PSA. How can you miss that huge opportunity to become the dominant player in the industry?�� Ghosn said. “Who is the winner of all this?”�It’s a great opportunity for PSA, it’s a big waste for Renault,�� said Ghosn.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Concerns are swirling that Japan’s dream of hosting the Tokyo 2020 Olympics could be a fatality of the spread of the new coronavirus, jolting organizers, sponsors, and media firms who have spent billions of dollars in the run-up to the event.International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said late last month that the IOC was “fully committed�� to holding the July 24-Aug. 9 Games on schedule, and a senior Japanese official told Reuters there was no “Plan B��.Below are the financial and economic factors at risk.Organisers said in December the Games were expected to cost some 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion), but that figure did not include an estimated three billion yen for moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to the northern city of Sapporo to avoid summer heat.Tokyo 2020’s budget is split between the organizing committee and local and national governments; the IOC contributed more than $800 million.Organizers say the national government will have paid some 150 billion yen �� mainly for funding a new National Stadium.Japan’s Board of Audit, however, put government spending between the bid in 2013 and 2018 at 1.06 trillion yen ($9.81 billion), a discrepancy organizers attributed to differences in the definition of “Games-related�� spending.The Tokyo 2020 Olympics have generated record domestic sponsorship revenues of more than $3 billion.That does not include partnerships with Japanese companies Toyota 7203.T , Bridgestone 5108.T and Panasonic 6752.T, and others such as South Korea's Samsung, who through a TOP sponsors programme, have separate deals with the IOC worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Global insurers face a hefty bill if the coronavirus forces the cancellation of the Games, with estimates of the cost of insuring the showpiece running into billions of dollars.The IOC takes out about $800 million of protection for each Summer Games, which covers most of the roughly $1 billion investment it makes in each host city. Insurance sources estimated it would pay a premium of about 2-3%, giving a bill of up to $24 million to insure the Tokyo event.Analysts with the financial services firm Jefferies estimate the insured cost of the 2020 Olympics at $2 billion, including TV rights and sponsorship, plus $600 million for hospitality.NBCUniversal in December announced it had already sold more than $1 billion in advertising commitments in its planned U.S. broadcasts of the Games and was on track to surpass $1.2 billion, Variety reported. The company’s parent, Comcast, agreed to pay $4.38 billion for U.S. media rights to four Olympics from 2014 to 2020, Variety said.Discovery Communications, the parent of television channel Eurosport, has agreed to pay 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to screen the Olympics from 2018 to 2024 across Europe.During a recent call with investors, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Discovery’s chief financial officer, suggested a cancel led Olympics was “not going to have any adverse impact on our financials��, Variety reported, adding executives said the company had insurance to safeguard its investment.Most of the domestic spending on the Olympics has been done, so a cancellation would have minimal impact in that regard, economists said.A Bank of Japan study in 2016 estimated Games-related spending would peak at 0.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 and be less than 0.2% of GDP in 2020, research consultancy Capital Economics noted.Tourism, a major contributor to recent Japanese growth, could take a hit, although economists said the greater threat was from the coronavirus spread itself.Last year, Japan hosted 31.9 million foreign visitors, who spent nearly 4.81 trillion yen ($43.1 billion).Nomura Securities had forecast consumption of 240 billion yen from event-related tourism in 2020, which it said would evaporate if the Olympics were cancel led.Citigroup Global Markets Japan economist Kiichi Murashima said a loss of events-related tourism alone would chip 0.2 percentage points off GDP growth in the July-September quarter against the previous quarter.But he said the chilling impact of the virus on an already struggling Japanese economy, and on global growth if the spread did not peak, meant Japan’s GDP could show zero or even negative growth in the July-September quarter.A failure to contain the global spread of the virus, would scupper a scenario that sees Japan’s economy posting a V-shaped recovery after two quarters of negative growth through March, said Jesper Koll, a senior adviser at U.S. asset manager WisdomTree.	-12.77967387

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Corp said on Monday it will launch a service this year that would use satellite navigation data and the telco’s mobile base stations to help power self-driving buses, drones and farm machinery.The service, which will begin trials in Japan next month before expanding nationwide in November, aims to provide centimeter-level positioning to the autonomous tech that is beginning to be introduced across a range of industries, SoftBank said.Japan’s newly launched constellation of Michibiki satellites has been offering high-precision location data since last November, and SoftBank’s service will be an early attempt at building a commercial business with it.Despite the government backing, Japan is seen as lagging other countries in areas such as autonomous driving and the use of drones in part because of onerous legal restrictions.Kajima Corp, one of Japan’s big four construction firms, will trial the service with construction site monitoring drones. SoftBank’s own SB Drive, which is developing self-driving tech for buses, will also run trials.SoftBank is expanding its backing for the nascent field of autonomous driving on multiple fronts including Monet, a self-driving car venture set up with Toyota Motor.SoftBank’s parent SoftBank Group Corp’s portfolio companies control 90% of the world’s ride-hailing industry and it has taken stakes in self-driving units at Uber Technologies and General Motors Co.Those investments come despite disappointment with speed of development in the self-driving industry, which has failed to deliver on earlier bold promises of commercial autonomous cars.	7.364767629

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Striking Chicago public school teachers reported some headway at the bargaining table on Friday in a contract dispute focused on reducing class sizes and other issues that would benefit students.In addition to wage increases, the union has emphasized the demands of teachers for more money to ease overcrowded classrooms and to add more nurses, social workers and teaching aides.On the second day of the strike, the two sides focused negotiations on three of the union’s demands: more preparation time for special education, more special education case managers and teachers and more bilingual education support staff, said Chicago Teachers Union spokeswoman Chris Geovanis.“We’ve seen some movement, but it’s not enough,�� union Chief of Staff Jennifer Johnson told reporters, adding that Chicago Public Schools (CPS) presented a counter proposal on staffing levels on Friday.Sticking points in the talks included the needs of homeless students, pay for veteran teachers, and pay for low-wage employees such as teacher assistants, Johnson said.Bargaining was set to resume at 1 p.m. on Saturday and continue on Sunday, union President Jesse Sharkey said.Officials with CPS were not immediately available for comment on the negotiations on Friday.The work stoppage forced officials to cancel classes for more than 300,000 students, but school buildings stayed open for children in need of a place to go during the strike.Teachers in red T-shirts and sweatshirts were on picket lines outside many of the city’s 500 public schools.“I feel really hopeful by the support that I have seen around the city,�� said Suzanne Van Kersen, who teaches English as a second language, as she picketed outside Mather High School on the city’s North Side.“The mayor seems really stubborn,�� she added, “so I am not encouraged that this is going to be over soon.”The strike, involving 25,000 teachers, is the latest in a recent wave of work stoppages in school districts across the United States in which demands for school resources have superseded calls for higher salaries and benefits.In Chicago and elsewhere, teachers have emphasized the need to help underfunded schools, framing their demands as a call for social justice.That emphasis has resonated with many Chicago parents but even so, the strike has put some of them in a bind over child care.Daniel Perez, a 43-year-old project manager, had to bring his two elementary school children to work at a construction site on the South Side on Friday.“I have had to adjust my whole schedule and thank God I have the flexibility. But other parents do not have that and I feel bad for them,�� he said as his children sat in his black Toyota truck.The strike comes seven years after Chicago teachers walked out for seven days over teacher evaluations and hiring practices. In 2016, teachers staged a one-day walkout to protest the lack of a contract and failure to stabilize the school system’s finances.The district has offered a raise for teachers of 16% over five years, enforceable targets for reducing class sizes and the addition of support staff across the district, according to Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who was elected in April.Lightfoot has previously said the union’s full list of demands would cost the district an additional $2.5 billion annually.Wall Street credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service, which rates the district’s debt in the junk level, said on Thursday the outcome of labor negotiations would have “substantial ramifications on whether CPS�� financial recovery continues, given its limited financial flexibility and narrow reserves.��	5.340375587
* Death toll at 42 from two strong quakes* More than 500 aftershocks since Thursday quake* 110,000 people displaced, 30,000-strong rescue team in place* Sony, Toyota, Honda operations affectedBy Thomas Wilson and Minami FunakoshiTOKYO, April 18 (Reuters) - Survivors from a series of deadly earthquakes in southern Japan spent a cold night in cramped shelters or camped out in fields as 30,000 rescue service personnel rushed to provide food and to search for those still missing on Monday.A 7.3 magnitude tremor struck early on Saturday, killing at least 33 people, a little more than 24 hours after nine people died in another quake in the same area.More than a thousand people were injured, with widespread damage to houses, roads and bridges, including at least one mountain highway severed in two, concrete tumbling into the valley below.Factories for major manufacturers including Toyota, Sony and Honda were closed, causing supply chain disruptions around Japan.Food was in short supply as roads remained cut off by landslides.“Yesterday, I ate just one piece of tofu and a rice ball. That’s all,�� said the mayor of one of the areas affected. “What we’re most worried about now is food. There’s no electricity or water, either.”Of more than 500 quakes hitting Kyushu since Thursday, more than 70 have been at least a four on Japan’s intensity scale, strong enough to shake buildings.Quakes are common in Japan, part of the seismically active “Ring of Fire�� which sweeps from the South Pacific islands, up through Indonesia, Japan, across to Alaska and down the west coast of the United States and Central and South America.At the other end of the ring this weekend, Ecuador’s biggest earthquake in decades killed at least 235 people, caused devastation in coastal towns and left an unknown number trapped in ruins. A 6.1 magnitude quake also struck southeast of the Pacific island nation of Tonga, with no immediate reports of damage.Three nuclear plants in the southern Japanese region were unaffected by the quakes, but the Nuclear Regulation Authority said it will hold an extraordinary meeting on Monday to discuss the disaster.A massive 9 magnitude quake and tsunami in northern Japan in March 2011 caused the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986, shutting down the nuclear industry for safety checks and sending radiation spewing across the countryside.Nearly 20,000 people were killed in the 2011 tsunami.Public broadcaster NHK showed footage of forests and rice fields torn apart by the force of the quake, saying one 50 km strip shifted almost 2m sideways.In the village of Minamiaso, 10 people were “out of contact��, said public broadcaster NHK. Rescuers pulled 10 students out of a collapsed university apartment in the same settlement on Saturday.The Kumamoto region is an important manufacturing hub.Toyota Motor Corp said it would suspend production at plants across Japan after the quakes disrupted its supply chain.Electronics giant Sony Corp said its Kumamoto image sensors plant would remain suspended. One of the company’s major customers for the sensors is Apple. Meanwhile, Honda Motor Co. said production at its motorcycle plant in southern Japan would remain suspended through Friday.Suga said the government may seek a supplementary budget to cover the cost of the quakes.All commercial flights to the damaged Kumamoto airport were cancelled and Japan’s bullet train to the region suspended.Over the weekend, rescuers digging with their bare hands dragged some elderly survivors, still in their pyjamas, out of the rubble and onto makeshift stretchers made of tatami mats.“It’s full in there. There’s not a inch to sleep or even walk about in there. It’s impossible in there,�� a resident of Mashiki town said outside an evacuation centre on Sunday.Hundreds of people queued, some for more than an hour, to get food as power and water supplies to tens of thousands of homes remained cut off.Police said 33 people had been confirmed dead in Saturday’s quake. The government said about 190 of the injured were in a serious condition. Some 110,000 people had been displaced.The epicentre of Saturday’s quake was near the city of Kumamoto and measured at a shallow depth of 10 km (six miles), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said. The shallower a quake, the more likely it is to cause damage.The city’s 400-year-old Kumamoto Castle was badly damaged, with its walls breached after having withstood bombardment and fire in its four centuries of existence.The USGS, a science organisation that provides information on ecosystems and the environment, estimated there was a 72 percent likelihood of economic damage exceeding $10 billion, adding that it was too early to be specific. Major insurers are yet to release estimates.	-1.770510836
TOKYO, May 21 (Reuters) - The lower house of parliament on Thursday approved former Toyota Motor Corp executive Yukitoshi Funo to join the Bank of Japan’s divided policy board, a move seen as supportive of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s push for radical stimulus.Funo, a 68-year-old adviser to the auto giant, would replace Yoshihisa Morimoto, a former utility executive who voted against last October’s surprise monetary easing, when his five-year term ends at the end of June.The government nominee is set to receive the assent of the upper house on Friday, as the ruling coalition holds a solid majority in both chambers.While little is known on Funo’s stance on monetary policy, he may bring a dose of real-world pragmatism to the BOJ given his more than four decades of experience at the auto giant including heading its U.S. sales operation.Still, having Funo on the board would ease pressure on Kuroda, who faced a razor-thin 5-4 vote last October, when he pushed through a decision to expand monetary stimulus after having failed to convince sceptics, including Morimoto.Funo’s first policy-setting meeting will be on July 14-15, when the board will conduct a quarterly review of its long-term economic and price forecasts.

Toyota still targets sales in the region of 1 million by 2015, Leroy said, but added he would not push to reach that target if it cannot be done profitably.“We will not grow just for volume,�� Leroy told a media roundtable before the opening of the Geneva auto show where the group will unveil a new version of its Aygo city car. “If I can achieve profitable growth by pushing to 1 million, I will.”Leroy also said he expected to boost Toyota’s profitability in Europe in the financial year to the end of March after operating profit already jumped 56 percent to 327 million euros ($450.39 million) in the first nine months.He said the weakness of the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira had a “very negative�� impact on his operations, but would not affect the profitability target. He did not foresee any major improvements in those two currencies anytime soon.Leroy said the company was carefully monitoring the unfolding situation in Ukraine and Russia, where the group sold 16,000 and 172,000 vehicles last year, respectively.The Japanese carmaker counts 56 countries, including Israel and Russia, as part of its European market, which Leroy expects to continue recovering.“Everyone agrees that the second half of 2013 was already better and 2014 will continue the same trend,�� he said. “But it will be a very, very slow recovery.�� He said growth in the region this year would be driven by western Europe, while he expected central and eastern Europe to be stable.Since 2010, Leroy has spearheaded a restructuring of Toyota’s European business while the automaker faced a safety crisis in the United States and production halts after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.He expects sales and market share gains to be buoyed by new models, further cost cuts and the increased popularity of hybrids, adding Europe was already Toyota’s fastest growing hybrid region.“Last year, we sold more than 156,000 hybrids in Europe, which is almost 20 percent of our sales,�� Leroy said.Karl Schlicht, head of sales in Europe, later added that the carmaker’s hybrid versions of its Yaris and Auris model had “been a breakthrough�� for the group in the technology and helped boost sales by being more traditional European designs and with a pricing that came closer to the mainstream options.($1 = 0.7260 euros)	-2.039753494
"HANGZHOU, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Cashback offers, up to 10 free oil changes, generous prepaid gasoline cards - these are just some of the giveaways China’s auto dealerships are using to woo customers out and about after spending much of February and March in lockdown.For the most part, they are getting the job done.Cui Peng, a Geely 0175.HK sales manager in the eastern city of Hangzhou, says unit sales at his dealership jumped 30% in April from March and they are hoping for 25% growth in May. That is partly due to delayed demand after China shut down to contain the coronavirus. But it is also thanks to an offer of six free engine oil changes, worth around 3,000 yuan ($420), for customers who buy models such as the Binyue sport utility vehicle.“Although car retail prices are not much different from usual, customers get to enjoy these complimentary services that do not impact our budget much in the short term,�� he said.In the nearby city of Ningbo, a Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T dealership offering 10 free oil changes saw April vehicle sales return to pre-virus levels and is aiming for sales in May to climb 10% month-on-month, its marketing manager Chen Xiaotian told Reuters.Even some luxury brands were offering deals, with one Lexus store in Hangzhou enticing customers with thousands of yuan in cashbacks.Visits and phone calls by Reuters to dozens of dealerships in the world’s biggest auto market showed most have notched up double-digit percentage jumps in unit sales for April compared to March and many expect May sales to grow at least another 10%.Their efforts helped China log its first positive growth in vehicle sales in nearly two years, up 4.4% in April from the same month a year earlier.But the industry remains deeply worried. Any momentum from demand that was locked up in February and March is expected to peter out by the end of May. After that, the outlook for consumer spending is bleak as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hammer the global economy, including China’s exports.Moreover, industry executives believe the generous deals currently being offered to customers are priming the market for a return to price wars.Feng Xingya, general manager of state-owned automaker GAC 601238.SS which has partnerships with Toyota and Honda Motor Co 7267.T, believes a bruising price war is on the cards.“When there is not much demand amid a pickup in production, price competition will obviously increase,�� he told an investor conference in April, adding GAC “cannot be afraid of or refuse to enter any price war.”Slipping back into price war mode would be easy enough in a crowded market where pandemic-hit automakers are desperate to gain what sales they can.The industry has already been there twice in the recent past. In 2018, sticker prices took a hit as China’s auto market began to weaken after two decades of strong growth while in mid-2019, dealers offered big incentives after the chaotic implementation of new emissions standards.“Offering gifts and cashbacks suggests a lack of substantial customer demand,�� said Alan Kang, a senior LMC Automotive analyst, adding more brands could offer incentives across more segments to maintain market share.Kang believes China auto sales will be either flat or show slight growth in the second half of this year.Dealers noted customers had recently become far more price sensitive.""We are repeatedly asked by customers about whether Hangzhou will roll out policies to support car demand such as subsidies,"" said Avery Wu, marketing manager at a Hangzhou-based Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE dealership.She added some customers were holding off on purchases in the belief that such subsidies will be forthcoming."	2.973168963
Oct 4 (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators have opened an investigation to determine which automakers may have produced vehicles with gas-filled struts on rear liftgates that are prone to failure.The gas struts, made by Koblenz, Germany-based auto supplier Stabilus, were involved in four previous recalls of about 276,000 minivans sold in the United States. Now, safety regulators want Stabilus to give them a list of customers who may have used the same type of gas-filled struts.Representatives for Stabilus could not immediately be reached to comment.The gas-filled struts help raise, lower and support liftgates on vehicles with power liftgates. They could close unexpectedly due to a leak of pressurized gas, increasing the risk of injury, according to a filing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Also, the liftgates may drop unexpectedly after reaching the fully open position.Stabilus is a global auto parts supplier, and has U.S.-based facilities.The four past recalls all involved minivans: the Honda Motor Co Odyssey for model years 2005, 2008 and 2009; the 2004 to 2006 Toyota Motor Corp Sienna; the 2004-2006 Ford Freestar; and the 2004-2006 Mercury Monterey.The largest recall was for 196,222 Toyota Sienna, recalled in 20008. The Honda recall was in February of this year.The Freestar and the Monterey recalls were made in 2006. The Freestar and Monterey minivans are no longer in production, and the Mercury brand was killed by Ford Motor Co two years ago.An investigation is not a recall, but depending on the results of the probe, may lead to one or more of them.	4.697554698
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. vehicle fleet hit a new record for fuel efficiency in 2018 averaging 25.1 miles per gallon (mpg) in real-world driving as it rose 0.2 mpg, the Environmental Protection Agency said.The fleet is also preliminarily anticipated to jump to 25.5 mpg for the 2019 model year.EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler cited the small annual increases as evidence the Obama era requirements are “unfeasible.”The administration is working to finalize rules to rollback Obama-era requirements through the 2026 model year.The report also showed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV purchased a significant number of vehicle emissions credits, while Tesla Inc, Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp sold credits.

"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s carmakers and dealers on Thursday called for a clear, nationwide policy to combat air pollution, after a crackdown on diesel cars and trucks in New Delhi, which campaigners have vowed to extend to other cities.A Supreme Court decision on Wednesday to alleviate the smog-choked capital has unsettled India’s car industry, which says an uneven, haphazard policy makes it hard to plan investments and allows damaging regulatory arbitrage across states. [nL3N14525A]""To improve the air quality ... we must take a comprehensive view of various factors causing pollution,"" said Vikram Kirloskar, vice-chairman of Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T local unit. According to the World Health Organisation, 13 of the world’s 20 most polluted cities are in India. To combat this, the government is debating policies including reducing cars in Delhi or offering cash to drivers who scrap old vehicles.But the government has yet to announce a holistic policy or target more difficult causes of pollution such as generators or even motorbikes, a family vehicle for millions of middle class Indians. Wednesday’s decision, the Supreme Court said in its order, would not hit “the common man��.New Delhi has one of the world’s worst air pollution levels, but other cities such as Patna and Kolkata in India’s east and Mumbai in the west also frequently register hazardous levels.On Thursday, according to measurements taken by the U.S. Consulate, Delhi registered an air quality index of 393 - well over the 301 level that marks “hazardous�� levels. But Kolkata was “very unhealthy�� at 212 and Mumbai “unhealthy�� at 172 - all higher than Beijing, which was at 151.“There needs to be a clearly laid out roadmap of what the government expects from the (auto) industry for the next 5-10 years, so companies get time to adapt and respond,�� said Mohit Arora, executive director at consultancy J.D. Power Asia Pacific.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at India’s Centre for Science and Environment said the decision to ban large diesel vehicles in Delhi would trigger similar moves elsewhere, making a comprehensive solution essential.“We need a national solution to the diesel problem,�� she said, adding that the government should either equalise the price of petrol and diesel or tax diesel cars at a higher rate until India adopts unified, stricter emission norms.Analysts say that among those who have the most to lose from India's haphazard policies are dealers selling cars made by Toyota, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra MAHM.NS, Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE and Tata Motors' TAMO.NS luxury arm, Jaguar Land Rover, brands who make large diesel cars. Dealers in Delhi are already trying to send about 2,000 unsold - now banned - diesel vehicles to other dealerships in India or back to carmakers, said K.V.S. Rao, president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA).“This is just a trigger, a starting point,�� said Rao.For Rao, a bigger worry is the call for a tax on all diesel vehicles - to be heard by the Supreme Court on Jan. 5."	-7.532759868
* Toyota had seen hydrogen as main alternative to gasoline* China NEV policies have forced a strategy re-think* Now plans plug-in hybrid and all-electric battery cars for China* Toyota irked that China classes Prius as a gasoline carBy Norihiko ShirouzuSHANGHAI, April 19 (Reuters) - The automotive industry’s seemingly inexorable drive towards electric cars - and especially Chinese polices pushing new energy vehicles - has forced Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s No.2 automaker by sales, into what one executive calls an “agonising�� strategy U-turn.Until recently, Toyota was one of the industry’s major hold-outs against full electrification, and planned to more or less skip all-electric battery cars and turn instead to hydrogen as a mainstream alternative to gasoline-fuelled cars.In 2013, Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, father of the gasoline-electric hybrid Prius, told Reuters the hydrogen car was a “practical alternative�� to the traditional combustion engine, and if there was any use for the electric vehicle (EV), it was “only as a neighbourhood errands car��.Fast-forward to late last year, and Toyota said it had begun developing a long-range all-electric battery car, which industry experts say should hit the market around 2020. The Japanese firm has put its president, Akio Toyoda, in charge of a new unit called the EV Business Planning Department.One Toyota executive, who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media, said the strategy about-turn was “agonising�� and “heart-wrenching��.Toyota had for some time predicted conventional hybrids and plug-in hybrids would be a medium-term bridge to hydrogen-powered cars of the future.In late 2014, Toyota launched the Mirai, a hydrogen fuel-cell car, selling in Japan for 7.24 million yen ($66,636) before subsidies and rebates. The model retails in the United States at $57,700 before subsidies.The game-changer for Toyota is China - the world’s biggest market and one where tough policies to push cleaner energy cars have challenged global automakers.Latest draft proposals from Chinese policymakers, released in September, require 8 percent of automakers�� sales to be battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles by next year, rising to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020.After some industry pushback, the scale and pace of those plans may shift, but Toyota and other automakers don’t see much changing fundamentally in China’s drive to electrification by around 2020.“Those mandates are tough to the point it could wreck our fundamental business case,�� said another Toyota executive.Toyota is particularly exercised by China’s proposed policy move to categorize conventional hybrids, like the Prius, as gasoline-fuelled cars. That would mean conventional hybrids would not generate what China calls new-energy vehicle (NEV) credits, which automakers could use to meet strict fuel economy rules.Under the proposals, each hybrid an automaker would sell in China would set them back by one NEV credit point.“The Prius and other hybrid cars are central to our green car strategy,�� said one of the Toyota executives.“But in China’s view, the Prius is no more than a gasoline car. We have no choice but to get over our EV allergy and come up with an electric car.�� Hiroji Onishi, the head of Toyota’s China business, said on Tuesday ahead of this week’s Shanghai auto show that the Japanese firm would start selling plug-in electric hybrid cars in China next year, and aimed to sell an all-electric battery car in China, but gave no timeframe.At a briefing on Wednesday, Onishi said this wouldn’t mean Toyota will de-emphasize sales of conventional gas-electric hybrid cars in China.Because automakers in China are expected to have to meet stringent fuel-economy requirements in addition to new energy vehicle quotas in coming years, Toyota will try to sell more conventional hybrids in an effort to meet fuel economy requirements, he said.Toyota sold close to 300,000 vehicles in China in January-March, up 1.7 percent on the same period a year ago.	1.41509434
* Adjusted Q4 earnings/shr 94 cts vs 87 cts Street view* Sees 14 million 2012 U.S. industry auto sales* Group 1 posted record yearly profit in 2011* Shares up 3 pctBy Bernie WoodallDETROIT, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Group 1 Automotive, one of the largest U.S. retail auto dealer groups, said earnings nearly doubled in the fourth quarter on higher sales of new vehicles as well as savings from cost cuts that began during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.The cost savings helped the company through last year’s inventory problems of Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co which were caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan last March and floods in Thailand last October.At the start of 2011, Toyota and Honda accounted for 49 percent of Group 1 new-vehicle sales. That figure fell to 41 percent, 30 percent for Toyota, for the full year 2011.The Houston-based company, which went public in 1997, set net profit records for the fourth quarter and the full year.In 2007, when the U.S. auto industry was averaging nearly 17 million vehicle sales annually, Group 1’s break-even point was about 13 million vehicle sales, which has been cut to around 10 million vehicles, company Chief Executive CEO Earl Hesterberg said in an interview with Reuters.“We thought that at less than 13 million units, we couldn’t make money and at 12.8 million last year, we set an all-time (profit) record,�� said Hesterberg.“With the fear that we had and the panic from the downturn of the recession, we stripped our company down and made it very lean, said Hesterberg. “So now, as revenue increases we have a much better business model.”In the fourth quarter, expenses from sales, general and administrative expenses fell to 76.1 percent, down 260 basis points from a year earlier. Hesterberg said such expenses were 83 percent to 84 percent during the financial crisis.Group 1 does not give financial guidance, but Hesterberg said he expects 2012 U.S. light vehicle sales will rise to 14 million, up 9 percent from 2011.This is slightly more bullish than most automakers and the 13.8 million in sales forecast by J.D. Power &amp; Associates.Group 1 said fourth quarter net income was $20.9 million, or 90 cents per share, up from $10.57 million, or 45 cents per share a year earlier.Adjusted for one-time items, earnings per share were 94 cents, beating analysts�� average forecast of 87 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares for Group 1 on the New York Stock Exchange were up nearly 3 percent on Thursday afternoon, at $56.98, which is up 10 percent since the start of the year.Group 1 sales rose 13 percent to $1.63 billion in the quarter.Gross profit from sales of new vehicles increased 23.6 percent, while gross profit from sales of used cars was up 14 percent.For the full year 2011, Group 1 revenue increased 10.4 percent to $6.08 billion.Since the start of the year, Group 1 has added a BMW dealership in South Carolina and a Volkswagen store in San Antonio. It now has 111 dealerships that have 143 franchises.J.P. Morgan said in a research note that the new acquisitions are “likely an attempt by the company to diversify its revenue base away from Japanese automakers.��	5.600204108
* Recall covers 1.05 mln vehicles in Japan, 615,000 overseas* Faulty brake master cylinder, fuel components identified (Adds details on defects, background)TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it would recall a total 1.67 million vehicles globally in a voluntary move to address three separate defects including a faulty brake master cylinder that could hinder the brake’s performance.Toyota said in an email it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths resulting from the defects. Some 1.05 million vehicles will be recalled in Japan and 615,000 overseas, covering Toyota models Crown Majesta, Crown, Noah, Voxy, Corolla Rumion and Auris, as well as more than a dozen Lexus models.Car makers have faced heightened global scrutiny on how quickly they share information with regulators and the public since a massive recall crisis in 2009 battered Toyota’s reputation and sales. Most vehicle recalls are issued on a voluntary rather than mandatory basis.Toyota recalled 6.39 million vehicles globally in April in its second-largest recall announcement ever. Two months later, the company issued a recall of almost 2.3 million vehicles globally for faulty airbag inflators that have also plagued other car makers.In the latest recall, about 802,000 Crown Majesta, Crown, Noah and Voxy models manufactured between June 2007 and June 2012 will be called back to replace a rubber seal ring in the brake master cylinder to prevent brake fluid from leaking. If brake fluid has already leaked, the brake booster will be replaced.A second recall of about 759,000 vehicles globally, including 423,000 in the United States, will fix faulty fuel delivery pipes that could, in the worst-case scenario, cause a fire through a fuel leak. Some of these vehicles are also subject to the first recall.Toyota will also recall in Japan 190,000 front-wheel drive Corolla Rumion and Auris models built between October 2006 and October 2014 that are not equipped with an idling feature to fix a defective fuel evaporative emission control unit.Shares in Toyota closed 0.2 percent higher in Tokyo at 5,990 yen after the recalls were announced, while the exchange’s Topix index gained 0.8 percent.

LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - The British government should reveal what post-Brexit reassurances it offered Japanese carmaker Toyota ahead of a 240-million pound ($313 million) investment in its English car plant, two parliamentary committees said on Monday.On Friday, Reuters reported that Britain had helped to secure an investment in the firm’s Burnaston car plant with a letter reassuring the Japanese automaker over future trading arrangements, according to two sources.The business ministry has confirmed the existence of a letter but refused to release it.One of the sources said the letter to Toyota was similar to one sent to Japanese carmaker Nissan last year when it decided to build two new models at its northern English plant.“To provide clarity to the public, as the assurances may cost the taxpayer money, and to other businesses, who are craving certainty to plan for Brexit, the letters should be published immediately,�� Nicky Morgan, the chairwoman of the Treasury Select Committee, said in an emailed statement.“It is vital that the government is not seen to be cutting sweetheart deals or granting special favours that could undermine our negotiating position,�� the chairwoman of parliament’s Business Select Committee, opposition Labour lawmaker Rachel Reeves, said in a separate statement.A business ministry spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Business minister Greg Clark said last year that assurances offered to Nissan were available to other firms.A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on Monday when contacted by Reuters.He referred to the company’s statement from the day of the March 16 investment announcement which said the British government was providing up to 21.3 million pounds in funding for training and research and development.Toyota also said at the time that “continued tariff-and-barrier free market access... will be vital for future success.�� ($1 = 0.7656 pounds) (Reporting by Costas Pitas and William James; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)	1.318181818
BEIJING, April 20 (Reuters) - Toyota aims to double auto sales in China to around 2 million vehicles a year in the future, a senior executive said on Sunday, as the top global car maker plays catchup to rivals, such as Volkswagen, in the world’s largest auto market.Toyota Motor Corp’s Executive Vice President Yasumori Ihara, who made the comments during a news conference at the Beijing auto show, did not give a specific time frame for the target.In 2013, Toyota sold 917,000 vehicles in China, up 9 percent from a year earlier, recovering from a sales plunge after September 2012 due to a diplomatic row between Japan and China over a set of isles. Its market share was at around 5 percent.If Toyota is able to hit its sales target of 1.1 million vehicles or more this year, it would meet the objective of selling 1 million vehicles a year in China four years later than initially planned.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group .

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday it will invest $102 million at its West Virginia engine and transmission plant and aluminum casting factories in Missouri and Tennessee to boost production.The Japanese automaker said it will invest $90 million at the Buffalo, West Virginia, plant to increase 6-speed automatic transmission production by almost 50 percent starting in early 2015.The rest of the investment will be spent at aluminum casting facilities in Troy, Missouri, and Jackson, Tennessee, to provide transmission cases and housing parts to the West Virginia plant, Toyota said.The project will create more than 100 jobs, the company said.The West Virginia plant currently builds more than 500,000 transmissions annually; the expansion will boost that to 740,000 per year, Toyota said. The plant employs 1,300 people and builds transmissions for the Toyota Avalon, Camry, Highlander, Sienna and Venza, and Lexus RX350 vehicles.(This story was refiled to add dropped word ‘and�� in first paragraph)	3.000804505

YOKOHAMA, Japan, June 26 (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor Co, told shareholders on Tuesday he was paid a salary and bonus of 987 million yen ($12.5 million) for the past fiscal year, a package that makes him Japan’s highest-paid executive.Ghosn has led Nissan since 2001 and steered the automaker through a turbulent 2011 that saw it bounce back faster than its domestic rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co from disruptions caused by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.Although Ghosn’s 0.5 percent pay rise for the past year put him just short of becoming the first CEO of a Japanese company to be paid more than 1 billion yen, investors have been far more concerned with his tenure than the terms of his compensation.Nissan has justified the higher pay for Ghosn and other Nissan executives by saying they should be compared to compensation packages for CEOs at other big, global industrial companies including Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG , rather than the lower pay for Japanese CEOs who tend to have come up through the ranks over a career.“Recruiting and retaining these best and brightest is a competitive advantage that we cannot afford to lose,�� Ghosn told an annual shareholders�� meeting in Yokohama.The disclosed compensation for Ghosn does not include stock options he was granted in the Japanese automaker. Those will be disclosed later this week, a spokesman said.The tally also does not include his compensation as head of Nissan’s alliance partner, Renault SA.Nissan said its board had weighed cash compensation for Ghosn against pay for CEOs at other major industrial companies with global operations based on advice from consulting firm Towers Watson.Nissan said the average CEO pay at the industrial companies it had used as a benchmark was $16.1 million, while the average CEO pay for global automakers was $17.5 million.That average included the $29 million paid to Ford CEO Alan Mulally and the $23 million paid to VW’s Martin Winterkorn.Ghosn made another 1.2 million euros ($1.7 million) for heading Renault in 2010. A comparable number for 2011 was not immediately available.Ghosn’s pay at Nissan has topped that of his counterparts at Toyota and Honda by a wide margin. Toyota President Akio Toyoda received 136 million yen ($1.71 million) for the past fiscal year, unchanged from a year earlier.In another point of comparison, Ghosn’s pay topped the total compensation for the 21 most senior executives at Sony Corp , another Japanese company that had been headed by a foreign CEO.Sony has asked its shareholders to approve payments of just over $10 million for its top executives including newly-appointed CEO Kazuo Hirai, who took over from Howard Stringer.Ghosn, 58, told Reuters on Friday that he was not planning to step down from his post anytime soon, following a Bloomberg report that he would retire before the automaker’s next business plan starts in about five years.	-2.870249017
TOKYO, March 2 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum would substantially raise costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in America.“The (U.S.) Administration’s decision to impose substantial steel and aluminum tariffs will adversely impact automakers, the automotive supplier community and consumers,�� the automaker told Reuters.Toyota added that more than 90 percent of the steel and aluminum purchased for cars built in the United States is sourced from the country.President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighboring Canada.Trump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum would be formally announced next week although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.

BOWMANVILLE, Ontario - A mishap filled ending allowed Justin Haley to win the Chevrolet Silverado 250 on Sunday as the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series made its annual trip to Canada to open up the 2018 playoffs at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park.Although he isn’t one of the playoff driver, Todd Gilliland seemed almost destined to win his first career truck series race. Taking the lead on Lap 53 from Johnny Sauter, it was smooth sailing for Gilliland until a late race caution set up a thrilling overtime battle with his Kyle Busch Motorsports teammate Noah Gragson, a playoff driver. Gragson, who won both previous stages, dived to pass Gilliland in the final turn.In similar shades to the move made by Chase Elliott in the 2013 race, the contact sent both Gragson and Gilliland spinning. The two trucks blocked the racetrack, causing a massive pileup coming to the checkered flag. The ensuing carnage allowed fellow playoff driver Haley to sneak through the wreckage and win the race.Haley, a 19-year-old driver from Winamac, Ind., led only a single lap all race, and it proved to be the most important one. He claimed his second checkered flag of the season.“We were just in the right place at the right time�� Haley said while celebrating in Victory Lane. “I can’t thank everyone at GMS Racing enough. It was a truly blessed day.”Haley also becomes the sixth different winner in as many races at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, and scores GMS Racing’s first win at the historic 2.459-mile road course.A visibly dejected Gilliland expressed his anger toward his Kyle Busch Motorsports teammate following the contact in Turn 10.“I should have never let him get to me,�� Gilliland said. “We should have given him the inside. We had the fastest truck, and we didn’t win again.”Gragson took immediate responsibility for the contact in the final corner, apologizing profusely to his teammate.“That was on me,�� said Gragson. “I was racing for the win.”�I apologize to Todd, the No. 4 team and everyone at KBM. I was expecting a little more room on the bottom, and we made contact. Again, I want to apologize to everyone on that 4 team, that was on me.”Following the intense finish, Haley locks himself into the Round of 6 continuing his hunt for the NASCAR Camping Truck Series championship. The Round of 6 begins Oct. 27 at Martinsville (Va.) Speedway.“This is what we came to do,�� Haley added. “This is road course racing, and now we are really looking forward to Vegas. Mission accomplished.”The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series returns to action Sept. 14 for the second race in the playoffs, the World of Westgate 200 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- Chevrolet Silverado 250Canadian Tire Motorsport ParkBowmanville, OntarioSunday, August 26, 20181.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T sales in China fell about 40 percent in September from a year earlier to about 50,000 cars, and the decline will likely force the company to miss its goal of selling 1 millions cars there this year, a source with knowledge of the sales said on Friday.That would be down from about 86,000 sold in September 2011 but better than the tally reported earlier by Japan’s Yomiuri newspaper. The daily said Toyota’s China sales last month halved from the 75,000 sold in August.	4.697554698
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The government conducted a thorough review and was justified last year in concluding that software systems played no role in unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles, an independent scientific panel said on Wednesday.The finding by the National Research Council’s Transportation Research Board represents the final piece of the federal investigation into recalls of 8 million Toyota and Lexus cars and trucks in 2009 and 2010.It is also an important step for the automaker, which is trying to rebuild its reputation with consumers for reliability. Toyota still faces lawsuits over the safety crisis.Toyota shares were virtually unchanged at $67.39 in late morning New York Stock Exchange trading.The independent report from academic, industry, scientific and regulatory experts was requested by the Transportation Department as a follow-on to the Toyota investigation by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and technology experts at NASA.NHTSA said in a statement that it was reviewing the panel’s findings, which pointed out steep challenges faced by the agency in conducting investigations of sophisticated vehicle electronics without outside help.	20.45158489
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s leading share index is expected to open lower on Friday, hurt by a strengthening yen after factory activity data showed a slowdown in both China and the euro zone, reigniting concerns about global economic growth.Nikkei futures in Chicago closed at 9,935 on Thursday, down 105 points or 1 percent from the Osaka close of 10,040, while strategists expected the Nikkei .N225 to trade between 9,900 and 10,100.“The Japanese market will have a correction today. The key is the yen appreciation to around mid-82 yen,�� said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Inc. “It’s also a Friday, so people will take profits before the weekend.”On Thursday, the Nikkei closed up 0.4 percent at 10,127.08 points, while the broader Topix .TOPX added 0.4 percent to 862.07.The yen was last traded at 82.629 to the dollar after hitting a one-week high of 82.329 on Thursday, well off an 11-month low of 84.187 on March 15.Hiroki remained upbeat on Japanese equities, however.The benchmark Nikkei is up nearly 20 percent this year, boosted by a run of strong U.S. economic data and accommodative monetary policies by global central banks.Deutsche Bank said there were still pockets of good value in Japanese shares, especially among exporters, following the bounce.“Even after the rally, there are some interesting value opportunities in Japanese equities and for patient investors we find more distressed value in Japanese equities than in the credit-stricken European equities,�� Deutsche Bank said in a report.“The new story is that we may now be facing a structural change regarding the multi-year strengthening of the yen.��&gt; Wall St retreats but bull market still alive .N &gt; Euro down vs yen, dollar as recession fears weigh &lt;FRX/&gt; &gt; Treasury prices post third day of gains &lt;US/&gt; &gt; Gold hits two-month low on slowdown fears &lt;GOL/&gt; &gt; Oil down on weak Chinese, euro zone data &lt;O/R&gt;--TOYOTA MOTOR CORP 7302.TToyota Motor has no intention of offering ultra-cheap cars to boost sales in emerging markets and will keep its focus on customers who expect a certain level of reliability, the company’s president, Akio Toyoda, said on Thursday.--NEC CORP 6701.TNEC said on Thursday it would spend $450 million to buy the business support operations of U.S. telecoms firm Convergys Corp CVG.N as it hunts for new telecom equipment sales abroad.--KOMATSU LTD 6301.TThe construction machinery maker expects group operating profit to top 300 billion yen ($3.64 billion) in fiscal year 2012, its President Kunio Noji signaled, according to the Nikkei business daily.--MURATA MANUFACTURING CO 6981.OSComponents maker Murata Manufacturing said on Thursday it would invest 3.4 billion yen ($41 million) in Toko Inc 6801.T to tap the smaller firm's expertise in coils and metal alloys to develop next-generation inductors.

TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average finished 2 percent high on Monday, as exporters gained following a pullback in the yen, while market heavyweights such as Fanuc and Fast Retailing helped boost the benchmark index.The Nikkei advanced to 22,149.21 points, its highest close since Feb. 5.The broader Topix rose 2.2 percent to 1,775.15, but volume was thin, with only 1.29 billion shares changing hands, the lowest since late December due to market holidays in the United States and Greater China. Turnover also dropped 14 percent to the lowest since late December to 2.3 trillion yen.The dollar was little changed at 106.330 yen after sliding on Friday to 105.545, its lowest since November 2016. Recent gains in the yen has put a dampener on exporter stocks, with investors concerned a sustained uptick in the Japanese currency could hurt profits.Industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp gained 3.7 percent and clothing chain Fast Retailing advanced 2.5 percent, contributing a combined 77 points to the Nikkei.Automakers rose, with Toyota Motor up 2.4 percent and Subaru Corp advancing 2.3 percent.Buying was also seen in the banking sector, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group both adding 2.2 percent.	-4.836216415
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering re-classifying petrol-electric hybrid vehicles so they get more favorable treatment than all-petrol or diesel counterparts under clean car rules, making it easier for automakers to meet environment quotas and offer more choice.Global hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T would be among the biggest beneficiaries of such change, which could allow them to make more hybrids and less of the more costly all-electric vehicles, experts said, after reviewing the draft policy proposal published on Tuesday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.China has some of the world’s strictest rules regarding the production of greenhouse gas-emitting vehicles, as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded cities.Those rules have pushed both domestic and international automakers to spend billions of dollars on the development and production of so-called new-energy vehicles (NEVs), such as those powered solely by electricity and hydrogen fuel cells, as well as plug-in hybrids.Under a system that kicked in this year, automakers in China are obliged to make up for a portion of the “negative�� points they incur when they produce internal combustion engine vehicles with points won for producing NEVs.Though more fuel-efficient than petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles, hybrids, introduced in 1997 with Toyota’s Prius, are currently classed alongside those powered by fossil fuels.In the draft proposal, hybrids would still be considered fossil-fuelled but re-classified as “low fuel consumption passenger vehicles��. Significantly, the number of negative points incurred for making hybrids will be less than for traditional vehicles.That could see more of those traditional vehicles replaced with hybrids, experts said, because when automakers produce hybrids, they would have to make up for fewer negative points.The proposed change came as a surprise, some experts and industry officials said, because the government has never given any preferential treatment for hybrid technology. Previously, the government offered subsidies for, for instance, the purchase of all-electric cars.“The new proposed policy is a roundabout way to promote hybrid cars,�� Cui Dongshu, secretary general of China Passenger Car Association, wrote in a social media post.Hybrid cars sold in China include versions of Toyota’s Corolla, Levin and Camry sedans, and versions of Honda’s Accord and CR-V. Beijing-based spokesmen for both Japanese automakers declined to comment.Local automaker GAC Motor 601238.SS, which makes hybrids in partnership with Toyota and Honda, said it ""keeps close attention to national policies and will actively respond to the promotion and development of relevant policies and standards."""	0.4071725002
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nidec Corp 6594.T plans to more than treble its revenue over the next five years by focusing on electric vehicle powertrains and buying specialists in motor technologies, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The world's leading maker of precision motors which supplies parts for Apple's APPL.O iPhones is expected to detail its plans as soon as Tuesday when it will name former Nissan Motor 7201.T executive Jun Seki as president, the sources said.The new strategy shows how the Kyoto-based company wants to play a bigger role in the auto industry as electric vehicle (EV) production takes off, after slowdowns in demand for motors in markets such as cellphones have weighed on its sales.“The EV motor system is key to our growth strategy,�� said one of the sources, a Nidec insider, referring to integrated EV powertrain systems commonly known as e-axles - technology that incorporates motors, power electronics and transmissions.“The e-axle market is going to be big, but it is only one half of our twin-pillar growth strategy,�� the person said. “The other big key to growth is in mergers and acquisitions of other motor-related technologies.”The sources declined to be identified because the information is not yet public. Nidec declined to comment.Nidec’s plan is to boost annual revenue to 5 trillion yen ($46 billion) by 2025, the sources said, from 1.55 trillion yen forecast for its financial year ending in March.Founder and CEO Shigenobu Nagamori has in the past alluded to a company vision of 10 trillion yen in revenue by 2030 but has not mapped out specific steps to achieve such a target.Seki, who told Reuters in December he was leaving Nissan for Nidec, is expected to help Nagamori lead the revenue push.Nidec has long been synonymous with Nagamori, who started out in 1973 with three workers in a Kyoto shed and built a global powerhouse with more than 100,000 employees, making motors for “everything that spins and moves��.Nidec already supplies e-axles to automakers such as China's GAC Motor 601238.SS and France's Peugeot SA PEUP.PA. Rival e-axle makers include Germany's Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen and Toyota 7203.T affiliate BluE Nexus, among others.Nidec wants to significantly improve the quality and performance of its e-axles so they become “more efficient, smaller and thus cheaper,�� one of the sources said.To meet its growth targets, though, it will have to boost sales of motors beyond those used in EVs and is looking for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), the sources said.From home appliances to cellphones to laptops to other devices, “Nidec will continue to be active in M&amp;A and gobble up attractive tech labs and startups and companies, even if they are small,�� one of the sources said.Nagamori told reporters this month that Nidec could spend 500 billion yen on its growth strategy, including technology acquisitions.It may use the money to acquire new e-axle technology and know-how to improve its existing products, the sources said, adding that the EV focus was fuelled by a belief more and more automakers will replace gasoline vehicles with electric cars.While pure battery-powered vehicles are just a sliver of global production now, they are expected to make up 5.6% of total production by 2026, according to AutoForecast Solutions.The research firm estimated production of all EVs, including gasoline hybrids, will reach 13.3 million in 2026 and account for 13.6% of total global car production of 98.1 million.Industry officials and experts say a key challenge facing Nidec and rival e-axle producers will be to get costs down to roughly $1,500 or below from the roughly $2,000 they cost now.Nidec’s confidence in the business stems from a view that automakers will behave more like smartphone or laptop producers as they phase out their reliance on the combustion engine.It believes that EVs - like laptops and smartphones - will be designed with key components that are ""as commoditised as Intel INTC.O chips for laptops"", one of the sources said.($1 = 109.7000 yen)"	-4.470198675
(This July 22 story is refiled to include omitted title for Chris Valasek, paragraph 3)BOSTON (Reuters) - Two security experts who a year ago exposed methods for hacking the Toyota Prius and Ford Escape say they have developed technology that would keep automobiles safe from cyber attacks.At last summer’s Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas, the two researchers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller, described ways to launch dangerous attacks, including manipulating the brakes of the moving Prius and the Ford Escape.Valasek, director of vehicle security research at the consulting firm IOActive, told Reuters on Tuesday that he and Miller will show off a prototype vehicle “intrusion prevention device�� at next month’s Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas.They built the device with about $150 in electronics parts, though the real “secret sauce�� is a set of computer algorithms that listen to traffic in a car’s network to understand how things are supposed to work. When an attack occurs, the device identifies traffic anomalies and blocks rogue activity, Valasek said.The two well-known computer experts decided to pursue the project because they wanted to help automakers identify ways to defend against security vulnerabilities in their products.“I really don’t care if you hack my browser and steal my credit card,�� Valasek said. “But crashing a car is life or death. It is dramatic. We wanted to be part of the solution.”The research the two have released on the Ford and Toyota cars, as well as work by other experts on different types of vehicles, has raised concerns that somebody might one day try to replicate their work to launch a real-life attack.Yet the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement on Tuesday that it is not aware of any incidents of consumer vehicle control systems having been hacked.The auto industry has beefed up efforts to identify and mitigate potential cyber security risks over the past few years.“Cyber security is a global concern and it is a growing threat for all industries, including the automotive,�� said Jack Pokrzywa, manager of global ground vehicle standards with SAE International, a group that represents industry engineers.Pokrzywa declined to comment on the specifics of the new technology from Valasek and Miller, though he said “Any viable solution reducing cyber threats is a step in the right direction.”A representative for Ford said she had no immediate comment on the device. Officials with Toyota could not be reached for comment.	-3.777852237
GUANGZHOU/BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - German auto giants Volkswagen AG, BMW and Daimler see China’s future as being electric - encouraged by generous government subsidies - but that bet puts them at odds with some of their Asian rivals.While the Europeans were heralding the all-electric vehicle at the Guangzhou auto show this week, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor were unveiling hydrogen fuel cell cars at shows in Tokyo and Los Angeles.The two Japanese heavyweights plan to start selling their hydrogen vehicles in 2015, brushing off electric technology as being good enough only to power tiny city cars.One of the most ambitious in betting on electric cars in China, the world’s largest auto market, is Volkswagen.On the eve of the Guangzhou show, Volkswagen said its brands, including Volkswagen and Audi, plan to launch a total of more than 15 near-all-electric plug-in cars by 2018, many of which will be locally produced.“We forecast high volumes in this area,�� Jochem Heizmann, head of Volkswagen Group China, told reporters this week.BMW and its local partner Brilliance Auto unveiled a jointly developed all-electric battery car in Guangzhou. The two companies plan to start leasing the car next year under a new jointly run China-only brand called Zinoro.Daimler said it was also on track to launch an all-electric car next year under a new China-only brand called Denza, which the German company operates jointly with Chinese battery and car producer BYD Co.The rush into all-electric cars comes as Beijing ramps up a programme to put 5 million new energy vehicles - defined as all-electric battery vehicles and heavily electrified “near all-electric�� plug-in hybrids - on the road by 2020.China this year expanded the definition of new energy cars to include fuel cell cars.The two concepts have polarised the industry.Fuel cell cars can run up to five times longer than their all-electric counterparts, but come with a heftier price tag.But unlike electric vehicles which can be recharged from home as well as charging stations, fuel cell cars must stop at refilling stations. The hydrogen stations are costly to build, at about $6 million apiece.Some industry insiders and experts believe China is too focused on all-electric cars or plug-ins.“Toyota believes the industry isn’t likely to come up with breakthroughs to make all-electric cars a viable solution any time soon,�� said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight. “Unlike China, some countries have taken a more flexible approach, rather than setting the path on one solution too early.”Toyota, in particular, thinks all-electric car technology is good enough to power only tiny city cars - not powerful enough for larger cars.At this week’s Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota unveiled a fuel cell concept sedan with two hydrogen tanks and a driving range of 500 km (310 miles). The car, it said, would sell for 5 million to 10 million yen ($50,000-100,000) when it goes on sale in 2015.Honda also unveiled a five-passenger hydrogen fuel cell vehicle at the Los Angeles Auto Show this week. By his own admission, the company’s chief executive of its U.S. business, Tetsuo Iwamura, expects uptake to be slow due to poor infrastructure.In China’s congested and bustling cities, electric charging or hydrogen fuelling stations are a rare sight. Volkswagen says the infrastructure is not good enough, and believes plug-in hybrid technology is the solution.Plug-in cars come equipped with a small gasoline engine that can power the car when it is drained of electricity.Nissan Motor plans to sell a fuel cell car in Japan and North America starting in 2017, but like Volkswagen, sees electric technology as the future in China, according to Ren Yong, a senior executive of Dongfeng Nissan Passenger Vehicle Co, Nissan’s Chinese venture with a local partner.Nissan plans to start selling a locally developed electric car in China under the Venucia brand as early as next year.

Later, Ford will have plug-in hybrid versions of the Fusion sedan and the Lincoln MKZ sedan.The Prius V is rated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 44 mpg in city driving and 40 mpg on the highway.The C-Max Hybrid, which goes on sale this fall, has a combined EPA rating of 47 mpg, compared with a combined rating of 42 mpg for the Prius V.Ford said the 2013 C-Max Hybrid will be priced from $25,995, including shipping. The 2012 Toyota Prius V starts at $27,395, including shipping; prices have not been released for the 2013 model.Ford also said that the C-Max Energi will have a top all-electric drive speed of 85 miles per hour, which it says is 20 mph faster than the Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid.Pricing of the C-Max Energi will be $29,995, including shipping charges and incentives, Ford said.The C-Max Energi has a battery pack and a hybrid transmission that are made by Ford at plants near Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where the vehicle will be assembled.The C-Max Energi will allow drivers to choose whether to drive solely on electric power, solely on gasoline-hybrid power, or by allowing the vehicle’s computer to use a blend of electric power and hybrid-gasoline power based on the state of the battery’s charge.The C-Max Energi will have an electric-drive range of more than 20 miles.	0.9019026439
SEEON, Germany (Reuters) - Siemens SIEGn.DE chief Joe Kaeser said on Friday he does not expect the German engineering group to come under pressure from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.Kaeser made the comments after Trump singled out Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and threatened to slap punitive tariffs on its Mexico-built cars.Turning to Britain’s plans to leave the European Union, Kaeser said the agreed timetable on Brexit must be stuck to. British Prime Minister Theresa May intends to launch by the end of March the two-year process of negotiating to leave the bloc.	-5.369968265
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is considering making batteries for electric vehicles (EV) with Panasonic Corp 6752.T, as it ramps up battery development to help meet its goal for green cars to comprise half of global sales by 2030.The joint announcement on Wednesday builds on an existing agreement under which Panasonic - a global market leader for automotive lithium-ion batteries - makes batteries for Toyota’s petrol-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.The plan to co-operate more closely on batteries comes as automakers compete to develop more EVs in compliance with tightening regulations worldwide to reduce vehicle emissions.Toyota’s battery needs are likely to increase after it said last year it would add fully electric vehicles to its product line-up in the early 2020s, expanding a green-car strategy which has focused on plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles (FCV).“The auto industry faces many hurdles to developing next-generation batteries which are difficult for automakers or battery makers to tackle on their own,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda said at a joint news conference.“It would be difficult for us to meet our 2030 goals given the current pace of battery development. That’s why we’re looking to Panasonic and other companies to help us develop ever-better cars and batteries.”Toyoda said the automaker’s annual sales target for petrol-electric and plug-in hybrids is 4.5 million vehicles by 2030, and 1.0 million units for EVs and FCVs.To that end, Toyota in September formed an EV technology venture with peer Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and supplier Denso Corp 6902.T. The venture reflects a trend of automakers and components makers partnering to develop the next-generation cars, to reduce research, development and manufacturing costs.In Panasonic, Toyota is partnering the main battery supplier of major U.S. EV maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O. With a 29 percent market share, Panasonic is the world's biggest supplier of batteries for plug-in hybrids and EVs, showed January-June data from Nomura Research.The pair plan to expand development of prismatic - flat, pouch-shaped - batteries with higher energy density. Panasonic already makes prismatic batteries for Toyota, whereas for Tesla, it makes cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops.“Our cylindrical batteries are the most widely used batteries in pure EVs at the moment,�� said Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga. “But when you look at the future, it’s difficult to gauge which format holds more demand potential.”�We need to be able to develop new battery technologies in a prismatic format, and this would be difficult on our own.��	9.830291386

(Adds NHTSA comment)DETROIT, July 28 (Reuters) - An influential consumer magazine on Monday called on Toyota Motor Corp to recall about 177,500 older Camry hybrid sedans to address potential power brake defects.Consumer Reports, which many consumers use when studying what vehicles to buy, said the Japanese automaker’s decision to call for a service campaign or a warranty extension on two different problems covering cars from model years 2007 to 2011 does not go far enough. Under a service campaign, an automaker repairs cars as they are brought back to dealers by consumers.“Consumer Reports believes that Toyota should recall these cars,�� the magazine said. “What’s at issue here is a series of acknowledged defects in a crucial safety system.“A recall is more comprehensive and widely published than a mere service campaign, and owners don’t have to wait for a problem to happen before qualifying for the repair,�� Consumer Reports added. “Besides that, unlike extended warranties, recalls don’t expire and are performed proactively.”Toyota spokesman John Hanson said in an email statement that the automaker was working with the U.S. safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on a probe related to the issue.“We believe our actions to address this issue are appropriate, and we are continuing to cooperate with NHTSA in its investigation,�� he said.Consumer reports said Toyota’s decisions were prompted partly by consumer complaints filed with NHTSA. The complaints over the last several years have covered loss of braking performance, increased effort to press the brake pedal and other difficulties, the magazine said.NHTSA opened a “preliminary evaluation�� probe into an estimated 30,000 Camry hybrid sedans from model years 2007 and 2008 after receiving 59 complaints of intermittent loss of assisted braking, resulting in increased stopping distances.NHTSA said it continues to evaluate all data as part of the investigation and will take action as needed.A preliminary evaluation is the first step in a process that can lead to a recall if regulators determine a manufacturer needs to address a safety problem.Consumer Reports, which pointed out Toyota’s service campaign and extended warranty both broadened the scope of the potentially affected vehicles, said its review for the two model years NHTSA cited found power-brake complaints had risen to 269, with 14 crashes and five injuries.In the service campaign, a problem is potentially caused by a clogged brake-fluid reservoir filter and “front-brake assist could be temporarily lost,�� according to a Toyota notice to dealers. Instead of a recall, Toyota will alert owners to the campaign to install a new brake reservoir tank at no cost between now and June 30, 2017.In the other case, Toyota is extending warranty coverage of the anti-lock brake system’s brake actuator from the standard three years or 36,000 miles, to 10 years or 150,000 miles, according to a separate dealer notice. Remedies could include a new actuator or reprogramming of the skid control electronic control unit. (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit. Editing by Andre Grenon)	-5.100348316
LE MANS, France (Reuters) - Double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso struck lucky with a second successive victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours race on Sunday with Toyota team mates Kazuki Nakajima and Sebastien Buemi.The number eight car crew, who were set for second until late drama, were also crowned world endurance champions with Nakajima driving the final stint and becoming the first Japanese to win a global FIA-sanctioned series.Toyota’s number seven TS050 hybrid, driven by Britain’s Mike Conway, Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi and Argentina’s Jose Maria Lopez, had a two-minute advantage before a puncture shattered their hopes with an hour to go.The team changed the wrong tire, due to a sensor issue, meaning the car had to limp around and pit again before rejoining in second place in a one-two finish for the Japanese manufacturer.The winning margin, after 385 laps of the Sarthe circuit in the 87th edition of a race watched by a crowd of 252,000, came down to 16.972 seconds.Alonso, 37, recognized fortune had played a big part in completing the unprecedented feat of winning Le Mans twice in one ��super-season��, a one-off scheduled to readjust the calendar so it finishes with the endurance classic in future.“The main goal this weekend was to win the championship,�� the Spaniard, who won his Formula One titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, told Eurosport television.“I think car seven was quicker than us for 24 hours, they really deserved the victory but today the luck decided that we have to take the trophy.“Luck sometimes plays an important part in motorsport and today we feel extremely lucky and maybe we don’t deserve it but we take it,�� added the former Ferrari and McLaren driver who left Formula One last year.“The world championship feels right at this moment.”The number eight crew had needed only a top-seven finish to be sure of the title.Alonso’s former McLaren Formula One team mate Stoffel Vandoorne, a Le Mans rookie, joined him on the podium in the third-placed number 11 SMP Racing BR Engineering car shared with Russians Vitaly Petrov and Mikhail Aleshin.That non-hybrid car finished seven laps off the pace.The two Toyota TS050 hybrids had started first and second, with the number seven car leading but with the gap repeatedly narrowed by safety car periods.Toyota remained in control throughout, with only the risk of mechanical failure or driver error to worry about in a top LMP1 category they have dominated as the sole major manufacturer.“We wanted to make it really boring, but that didn’t happen,�� said Toyota team boss Rob Leupen.“We got into a situation where we caught a puncture at the end, and it hurts a lot that the team didn’t respond well to that.”The title was the second of Buemi’s endurance career, after a first in 2014, and an addition to the all-electric Formula E crown the Swiss won in 2015-16.Alonso, a two-time winner of the Monaco Grand Prix, is now leaving the series and hoping to become only the second driver after the late Briton Graham Hill to complete the so-called ‘Triple Crown of Motorsport��.The Spaniard needs to win the Indianapolis 500 to complete that, a race he failed to qualify for this year after leading for 27 laps on his debut in 2017.The racing was punctuated by crashes, with Venezuelan former F1 driver Pastor Maldonado hitting the barriers at Tertre Rouge in the number 31 Dragonspeed LMP2 after daybreak and bringing out the safety car.Before that, the number 17 SMP spun out of third place in the early hours with Russian Egor Orudzhev at the wheel.	4.179753564
Harvick makes right call in Nationwide win at ChicagolandBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeJOLIET, Ill. -- Kevin Harvick got the track position he needed with a two-tire call under caution late in Saturday’s Jimmy John’s Freaky Fast 300.Then he and crew chief Ernie Cope got the victory they deserved for choosing the right strategy at the right time.Harvick beat Kyle Larson to the finish line by 2.108 seconds to win for the fourth time this season and the 44th time in his career -- a numerologist’s delight for those who favor Harvick’s No. 4 Chevrolet in Sunday’s MyAFibStory.com 400, the first race in the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup.Larson held off third-place finisher Kyle Busch in the closing laps. Ryan Blaney ran fourth, followed by Trevor Bayne.Series leader Chase Elliott came home 10th and maintained an 18-point lead in the standings over second-place Regan Smith, his JR Motorsports teammate.For Harvick, the tipping point came on Lap 154 when Cope called for the two-tire stop while race leader Busch took four fresh tires and got mired in traffic.“Well, we didn’t have many laps on the tires, but that’s the call that won us the race,�� Harvick said. “Ernie won the race for us, and the car was fast, but when we got out front and the tires not having many laps, and the 54 (Busch) being buried in the field -- that’s what won us this race today.”Busch, who led every lap in a dominating win last week at Richmond, looked to make Saturday’s race a runaway, too, but caution for Jeremy Clements�� blown engine on Lap 151 created an opportunity for divergent strategies and scrambled the field.By the time the field restarted on Lap 160, Busch had led 141 laps, but after a four-tire stop under the yellow, he restarted 16th in the No. 54 Toyota and made up eight positions before the engine in teammate Denny Hamlin’s No. 20 Camry erupted on Lap 165.Harvick, who had changed right-side tires only under the caution on Lap 154, made short work of four cars that stayed out under the yellow and surged into the lead past Aric Almirola and pole-sitter Brian Scott on Lap 161. But the caution for Hamlin’s engine failure bunched the field for a restart on Lap 174, with Busch taking the green flag from the eighth spot.Harvick drove away after the restart and Busch advanced quickly to third in the running order. But the No. 54 Toyota stalled behind Larson’s No. 42 Chevy as Harvick cruised to the comfortable win.“I fought my butt off the last run of the race,�� Busch said. “It sucks not being in Victory Lane where we should be. This car was fast -- but can’t get through traffic.��	-4.728576306
TOKYO (Reuters) - Takata Corp’s resistance to a U.S. order to expand a recall of its air bag inflators is likely driven by a need to protect itself from legal liability, but risks longer-term business damage by alienating the public, experts say.Takata this week rejected a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) demand to declare its inflators defective and call in vehicles U.S.-wide for replacement. An existing recall is limited to a few hot and humid states. In a letter, Takata queried NHTSA’s justification for the order while a cause for why its inflators can erupt with excessive force is still unclear. The Japanese firm left it up to automakers to decide whether to expand the recall.“Takata’s approach reflects ignorance or denial of the reality that the court of public opinion can put you out of business long before a court of law decides about liability,�� said Jonathan Bernstein, president of California-based Bernstein Crisis Management.Takata’s response drew criticism from U.S. regulators and lawmakers. In Tokyo, government officials privately expressed shock and concern, with one bureaucrat saying it would be “disastrous�� for Takata to fight NHTSA’s demand as Japan frets about the broader reputational impact on its auto industry.Defective Takata air bag inflators, which can explode and shoot shrapnel into the car, have been linked to five deaths. More than 16 million cars have been recalled globally since 2008, the bulk by Takata’s top customer Honda Motor Co.Takata’s approach is in contrast to Toyota Motor Corp’s handling of a massive recall in early 2010. Toyota was slammed for its initial response to cases of unintended acceleration in its cars, but got back on track, providing something of a blueprint for how to steer through such crises.Toyota insiders said CEO Akio Toyoda was a driving force for transparency and accountability. “Akio gave me three requirements,�� Steve St Angelo, then Toyota’s quality chief in North America, told reporters in Japan recently.“First, never lie, even if it hurts Toyota; second, don’t blame anyone for our problems - not the government, the media, and certainly not the customer. And third, don’t ever, ever put the safety of our customers in jeopardy. If it’s black and white, you take fast action. If you’re not sure ... you (err) on the side of customers�� safety,�� he recalled.Crisis management experts say Takata’s top executives are wrong to not openly go public with what they are doing about the air bag inflator problems.Shigehisa Takada, Takata’s CEO and the third-generation head of the founding family, last appeared publicly at a closed-door shareholders�� meeting almost six months ago. His deputy, Stefan Stocker, has also kept a low profile, and Takata is represented at U.S. congressional hearings by Hiroshi Shimizu, a senior vice president with no executive title.People who have met Takada recently say he appeared to have little sense of crisis, believing the problem will blow over in time.“Even though it’s a business-to-business company, there are consumers at the end of its products,�� said Hiroshi Osada, professor at Bunkyo University and member of an external panel that audited Toyota’s quality management during its 2010 crisis.“It’s unacceptable that top executives haven’t come forward yet. It speaks to the attitude they have towards this crisis.”Takata says senior executives have no immediate plans to hold a news conference, while lawyers have instructed its public relations staff to avoid meeting with journalists.	-4.386576765
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T plans to start selling U.S. vehicles that can talk to each other using short-range wireless technology in 2021, the Japanese automaker said on Monday, potentially preventing thousands of accidents annually.The U.S. Transportation Department must decide whether to adopt a pending proposal that would require all future vehicles to have the advanced technology.Toyota hopes to adopt the dedicated short-range communications systems in the United States across most of its lineup by the mid-2020s. Toyota said it hopes that by announcing its plans, other automakers will follow suit.The Obama administration in December 2016 proposed requiring the technology and giving automakers at least four years to comply. The proposal requires automakers to ensure all vehicles “speak the same language through a standard technology.”Automakers were granted a block of spectrum in 1999 in the 5.9 GHz band for “vehicle-to-vehicle�� and “vehicle to infrastructure�� communications and have studied the technology for more than a decade, but it has gone largely unused. Some in Congress and at the Federal Communications Commission think it should be opened to other uses.In 2017, General Motors Co GM.N began offering vehicle-to-vehicle technologies on its Cadillac CTS model, but it is currently the only commercially available vehicle with the system.Talking vehicles, which have been tested in pilot projects and by U.S. carmakers for more than a decade, use dedicated short-range communications to transmit data up to 300 meters, including location, direction and speed, to nearby vehicles.The data is broadcast up to 10 times per second to nearby vehicles, which can identify risks and provide warnings to avoid imminent crashes, especially at intersections.Toyota has deployed the technology in Japan to more than 100,000 vehicles since 2015.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last year the regulation could eventually cost between $135 and $300 per new vehicle, or up to $5 billion annually but could prevent up to 600,000 crashes and reduce costs by $71 billion annually when fully deployed.NHTSA said last year it has “not made any final decision�� on requiring the technology, but no decision is expected before December.Last year, major automakers, state regulators and others urged U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to finalize standards for the technology and protect the spectrum that has been reserved, saying there is a need to expand deployment and uses of the traffic safety technology.	5.667233648
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp holds a $293 million stake in Uber Technologies, as it partners with the ride-hailing company to further expand into new mobility services, Toyota’s latest corporate governance report released on Wednesday showed.The Japanese automaker has also unloaded shares in some of its suppliers, adjusting its portfolio to reflect partnerships with rival automakers and technology firms as it transforms into a mobility services company, the report showed.Reporting the total size of its stake in Uber, which became a listed company last year, Toyota said it held 10.25 million shares valued at 31.15 billion yen ($292.46 million) as of March 30. That is around 0.6% of Uber’s outstanding shares, according to a Reuters calculation.Toyota, one of the world’s biggest automakers, said it had reduced its shareholdings in 24 companies and increased them in 10, including two listed companies.In the past year, it took a stake in rival Suzuki Motor Corp as the pair deepen cooperation around the development of lower emission vehicles.Toyota sold its stakes in cutting tool manufacturer OSG Corporation, Nippon Steel Corporation, automotive lights and interior mirrors maker Ichikoh Industries, and transmission belt maker Mitsuboshi Belting.“If Toyota determines a shareholding is no longer meaningful or the meaning of a shareholding has been diluted due to changes in business environment or other reasons, (it) will proceed with the sale of such shares,�� the automaker said in the report.Toyota currently has an interest in 174 firms, including 65 listed companies, compared with 200 firms in 2015, of which 80 were listed companies.Toyota's biggest shareholders remained the same, although investors including Nippon Life Insurance Co [NPNLI.UL], JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. JPM_pd.N and State Street Bank and Trust Company [STTBT.UL] slightly increased their stakes, the latter two through proxy Mizuho Bank. 	-0.1565312671
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it is recalling more than 681,000 cars and trucks in the U.S. market to address potential problems.The Japanese automaker said it will recall about 495,000 Tacoma pickup trucks from model years 2005 to 2009 to replace a part in the steering wheel. It is also recalling about 70,500 Camry mid-sized cars and 116,000 Venza crossover vehicles from model years 2009 to 2011 to replace a stop lamp switch.Toyota said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries in either case.For the Tacoma, Toyota will replace the steering wheel spiral cable assembly because friction may occur over time involving that part, which may result in the driver’s side airbag being deactivated and not deploying in an accident.For the Camry and Venza, silicon grease during assembly may lead to increased electrical resistance that can cause the vehicle not to start or the shift lever not to move from the “park�� position, Toyota said.Both fixes will take about 30 minutes, the company said. Owners of the affected Tacomas will be notified in early April, while the others will be alerted as soon as Toyota has the necessary replacement parts.	-0.9936984973
FRANKFURT, Aug 16 (Reuters) - German private equity investor Triton has started to sift through bids it received for Dematic, a supplier of materials handling solutions for warehouses, people close to the transaction said.“We are seeing good interest from Asia and from other parts of the world,�� a person close to the seller said, adding both strategic players and private equity investors have raised their hands. The sale is being organised by Barclays and second round bids are due in autumn.The banks JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are working to put together loans for possible buyers, people close to the banks said.One banker said that this so-called staple financing amounts to roughly 500 million euros ($614 million), or five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).Dematic has annual sales of roughly 1 billion euros and in its fiscal 2011 posted an Ebitda of about 80 million euros, which it expects to increase to about 100 million this year.Sources close to private equity investors said the asset may sell at 700-800 million euros.Triton, on the other hand, is hoping for more, a source close to Triton said, adding that investor Permira accepted a valuation of 9 times Ebitda when it bought Dematic peer Intelligrated in June.A dearth of assets and the need to invest funds they got from their investors is currently driving financial sponsors to look at about anything that comes on the market.“However, many investors are skipping this one as they do not see any upside for themselves, especially at the requested price,�� said a banker who unsuccessfully tried to convince two private equity groups to bid.People close to Permira, Carlyle, Blackstone, KKR, CVC, BC Partners , Goldman Sachs Capital Partners said they were not interested, while others such as Bain Capital were at least taking the initial steps, such as handing in a tentative bid. All the private equity investors declined comment.Separately, a banker close to the industry said that Dematic could be a good fit for U.S. peers Rockwell, Pentair and Nacco, Japan’s Toyota Industries and Daifuku, Korean Shinheung Machine and China’s Weichuang Automation Equipment.Daifuku, Rockwell and Pentair declined to comment, while Toyota Industries, Nacco, Shinheung and Weichuang could not be reached for comment.Dematic was founded in 1819 and in 1973 became part of steel and machine group Mannesmann, which then sold it to conglomerate Siemens. Triton eventually acquired it in 2006.Dematic currently has roughly 4,000 staff worldwide, after Triton closed a German plant and enforced restructuring at other locations.	-1.404868596
LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Jenson Button has withdrawn from this year’s 24 Hours of Le Mans and will be replaced at SMP Racing by his former McLaren Formula One team mate Stoffel Vandoorne, the Russian team said on Friday.Belgian Vandoorne, who left Formula One at the end of 2018 and is now competing in the Formula E electric series, will also replace New Zealander Brendon Hartley at the Six Hours of Spa World Endurance Championship (WEC) round on May 4.Button, the 2009 Formula One world champion, cited his partner’s pregnancy as a reason for withdrawing from Le Mans, the highlight of the WEC season on June 15-16.“I really enjoyed driving for SMP Racing and was happy to be on the podium with this team, but I decided that now I need to spend more time at home with my fiancé during her pregnancy rather than two weeks at Le Mans,�� the Briton said in an SMP statement.“The decision has been made easier for me as I feel that the Toyota is currently unbeatable.”Toyota finished one-two last year and are the only major manufacturer competing in the top LMP1 class after Audi and Porsche withdrew.Button endured a disappointing debut last year when his SMP car suffered a sensor problem early in the race and before he had even got on track. When he did, it was in last position and the car was ultimately retired.SMP said former Toro Rosso F1 driver Hartley was unavailable for Spa, a home race for Vandoorne, due to other commitments.“The LMP1 cars are really demanding and their performances are very close to Formula One. I will have the opportunity to re-join ART Grand Prix and a lot of people that I’ve been working with during my successful campaign in GP2,�� said Vandoorne.ART run the car for SMP.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T production of trucks and SUVs will rise slightly by mid-2016 as it adapts to U.S. consumer tastes, several of its executives said in an interview on Thursday.Toyota’s full-size pickup truck, Tundra, is down to about 20 days of supply, and its 1,232 U.S. dealers have only 10 days�� supply of the Tacoma, the automaker’s mid-size truck, according to Bob Carter, senior vice president for U.S. Toyota operations, and Bill Fay, head of the U.S. Toyota brand, in an interview with Reuters.“If you were to ask any of our U.S. dealers what they want, I’d say every one of them would say ‘More trucks,’� Carter said.More production is on the way after the recent addition of a third shift of workers at a plant in Baja California, Mexico, that makes the Tacoma, and the addition of about 250 workers and a more flexible work schedule at its San Antonio, Texas, plant that makes the Tacoma and the Tundra, Carter and Fay said.The new workers and extra production will be in place in San Antonio by the middle of next year, Fay said.A big focus in 2015 has been the U.S. auto industry's shift away from traditional sedans and toward SUVs, particularly smaller models like the Toyota RAV4, the Honda Motor Co 7267.T CR-V and the Ford Motor Co F.N Escape.Nearly 59 percent of U.S. vehicle sales this year have been of SUVs or pickup trucks, up from 54 percent last year, according to industry consultant Autodata Corp. Most of that gain in market share is due to small SUVs, also known as crossover vehicles.The shifting tastes of American consumers toward SUVs will express itself as early as 2017, Carter said, when the RAV4 will displace the Camry mid-size sedan as the company’s top-seller in the U.S. market.“It may be as soon as two years, but I can comfortably say that in three years, RAV4 will be our No. 1 seller�� in the United States, said Carter.Camry will remain the automaker’s top-selling sedan as well as the country’s, he added. The Camry has been the best-selling, non-pickup truck model in the U.S. market for 13 years running.Toyota will collectively sell about 290,000 Tundras and Tacomas in the United States this year, Fay said, and will exceed 300,000 in 2016 with the boost in production.He would not specify exactly how many more they expect to sell next year. But Carter said that Toyota would like to have between 45 and 55 days of supply of their two pickups.(This version of the story corrects the number of new workers in San Antonio to 250 from 800 in paragraph four.)	-3.526608419
TOKYO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp posted a forecast-beating 4.4 percent rise in April-June operating profit and raised its U.S. vehicle sales target for the year to next March, boosted by strong sales of SUVs and pickup trucks in its biggest market.Toyota, the world’s best-selling automaker, said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit was 692.7 billion yen ($6.76 billion), exceeding the 637.3 billion yen mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.For the year to March 2015, Toyota stuck with its full-year operating profit forecast of 2.3 trillion yen. That would be a record high, although just a 0.3 percent increase from a year earlier as the tailwind from a weaker yen that helped boost export profits runs out of steam.A sales-tax hike in Japan in April dented demand for new cars and Toyota’s April-June domestic sales dropped 9.6 percent year-on-year to 319,460 vehicles.Toyota raised its full-year North America sales projection to 2.71 million vehicles from 2.62 million. In July, Toyota’s total U.S. sales rose 12 percent, surpassing Ford Motor Co to become the No.2 seller for the month.	-2.503570528
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Four people were killed and 11 injured when their landcruiser detonated a bomb planted on a road in northeast Kenya on Friday, a senior government official said, in the latest of a series of such attacks.Last month, at least eight police officers were killed in two roadside bombings in the area, with al Shabaab Islamist militants based in neighboring Somalia claiming responsibility.Early on Friday a public service vehicle was blown up by an improvised explosive device (IED) between Fino and Sheikh Barow, Mandera County Commissioner Frederick Shisia said.“A (Toyota) Landcruiser which was carrying about 15 people ran over an IED. It exploded, killing four instantly, and injured 11,�� he told Reuters by phone.Among the casualties were two local leaders. “One chief died and another got seriously injured,�� Shisia said.“We suspect it is al Shabaab militants, as they are the ones who are behind planting of IEDs in the area.”Al Shabaab, fighting to overthrow Somalia’s government and impose its own harsh interpretation of sharia law, says it will continue to attack Kenya until it withdraws its troops from an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.	5.377268386
Oct 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 72,100 automobiles in China in September, up 63.5 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday.That follows a 4.2 percent year-on-year drop in August and a 3.5 percent fall in July.The sharp rise in sales was partly due to the low base from last September, when Japan’s decision to nationalize disputed islands in the East China Sea sparked anti-Japan sentiment among Chinese consumers.In the first nine months of this year, through the end of September, Toyota sold a total of about 636,700 vehicles, down 0.5 percent from a year earlier.Toyota officials in August said the Japanese automaker and its two local joint-venture partners were on track to sell 900,000 vehicles in China this year, up 7.1 percent from 2012.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group.

Stenhouse wins Coke Zero 400 at DaytonaDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Ricky Stenhouse Jr. claimed his second career Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series victory and his second of the season Saturday night when he took the checkered flag in the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway.“Wow, these guys,�� Stenhouse said. “I kept my Talladega car and told them to build a new one. They built a Fifth Third Ford that was really fast. We won the Firecracker 400! This is awesome!“I have been coming here since 2008. I actually came in 2006 one time with Bobby Hamilton Jr. and it is cool to put it in victory lane and get our second win this year. I love it! Thank you to the fans for coming out here. Everyone at NASCAR. What a great weekend. America. 1776. We are the champs!”Stenhouse took his final lead on an overtime restart, getting a push from Michael McDowell. Clint Bowyer, though, got up to second on the final lap to take runner-up honors. Paul Menard finished third, while McDowell held on to finish a career-best fourth. Ryan Newman rounded out the top five.“Wow, what a night,�� Bowyer said. “A fun race. Our Mobil 1 Ford was strong. I got shuffled out on that second stage and that bummed me out. I wanted those stage points. It wasn’t that big a deal because I knew that we had a hot rod to get back up front.“Man, it’s just every man for himself. You’re beating and banging Both sides are ground off my car. Good night. This bridesmaid deal (stinks). I want to win. We’re in this business to win. That’s what Tony and Gene pay me to do. I’m proud of everyone on the Mobil 1 Ford team.”The race was attrition-filled, with the yellow flag waving 14 times, a record for the July race at Daytona. Early-race cautions came mostly as results of blown engines or stages ending, but later cautions came for wrecks, including the 13th caution of the race with less than 10 laps remaining.That wreck resulted in a red flag with six laps remaining after Kyle Larson’s car got airborne and Danica Patrick’s caught fire.“I was just up front there and doing what I could to stay up front,�� Larson said. The 38 (David Ragan) got to my inside and I saw that in my mirror and I kind of felt it a little bit because you can feel the air.“I was just trying to leave him a little bit of room and I just moved up too high and ran across Ricky’s nose and I hate that I caused that wreck and I feel pretty bad about. It was going to be an extremely good points day and we hurt that a little bit.”The yellow flag waved for the final time after a restart with three laps remaining in the scheduled distance when Denny Hamlin and Erik Jones spun and sent the race into overtime.More than a quarter of the 40 cars that started the race failed to finish and more than half were involved in at least some degree in an on-track incident. Drivers retiring from the race early included pole sitter Dale Earnhardt Jr.After going two laps down early because of a tire problem, Earnhardt eventually got back on the lead lap and raced back into the top -10 before being a part of a five-car wreck that brought out the ninth caution of the race around lap 106.“As soon as we got our lap back, I knew anything was possible,�� Earnhardt said. “We were just kind of drafting right back up there and I think the No, 4 (Harvick) got a flat. I had nowhere to go, but it was fun. We had a pretty strong car. We had some gremlins in there. I’m not sure what was going on with that, but we had the toe-in messed up. That first deal we brushed the wall a couple of laps earlier and I thought everything was OK.“I came through the tri-oval and I had a right front going down and it was trying to spin out, so I was trying to lift, but there was really nothing I could do because there were so many guys behind me. We got into (turn) one and hit the wall. But the guys worked on the car; we got our laps back and was about to have some more fun -- get back up in there and mix it up. Then, that happened with the No. 4.”With the high number cautions that littered the race, pit strategies varied throughout the race. Regulars up front throughout the second half of the race were Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Matt Kenseth and series rookie Daniel Suarez, but Kenseth was out of the race after involvement in the wreck that brought the 13th caution.Brad Keselowski, who led 32 laps in dominating the first 40-lap stage of the race, was also among those who retired early. He fell out of the race after spinning and hitting the wall on lap 116.Matt Kenseth was the leader at lap 80, the halfway mark and the end of stage two of the 160-lap race.Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Denny Hamlin was second at the end of stage two.After pitting under green on lap 16 because his right-rear wheel was secured by only on lug nut after a previous yellow-flag caution, Hamlin and Jones pitted under green on lap 37 and cycled to the top-two positions when everyone else pitted under yellow after stage one.Hamlin and Jones led laps early in the second stage, and Hamlin was up front for another restart past lap 60. He was joined up front by Kenseth, who had taken the lead by the time a caution came out on lap 70 for a multi-car crash that started with another JGR driver, Kyle Busch, getting turned.Other drivers collected in the wreck included points leaders Kyle Larson and Martin Truex Jr.Earnhardt lost the lead to Chase Elliott on the first lap, and then Keselowski moved into the lead early. Earnhardt was back up front late in the stage, battling Keselowski for the lead.A few laps into the second stage, Earnhardt got into the wall with a flat tire, sustaining significant damage to his car. Larson’s car also received damage in the melee, but the race remained green.Blown engines were a theme in the opening stage. The yellow flag waved twice in the first 40 laps, both times for engine issues.Cole Whitt’s blown engine resulted in the first caution on lap 10. The yellow waved again on lap 16 for D.J. Kennington’s blown engine. Another caution came before lap 60 for Jeffrey Earnhardt’s blown engine.Ryan Sieg also blew an engine early, but the race remained green.NOTES: Dale Earnhardt Jr. was fastest in final practice Thursday and in the first round of qualifying before winning the pole Friday. The Earnhardt-Chase Elliott one-two start was a reverse of the Daytona 500 front row, with Elliott on the pole and Earnhardt starting second. ... Brad Keselowski won last year’s Coke Zero 400. Kurt Busch won the 2017 Daytona 500 in February. ... Four drivers -- Earnhardt, Kevin Harvick, Jimmie Johnson and Jamie McMurray -- are the only four active drivers with wins in the 400- and 500-mile races at Daytona International Speedway. ... Jacob Canter, a fill-in for a fill-in, was Kyle Busch’s crew chief for the Coke Zero 400. Regular crew chief Adam Stevens continues his four-race suspension for a wheel coming off the car during the race at Dover (Del.) International Speedway. Stevens�� original fill-in, Ben Beshore, was suspended for one race after the car had two lug nuts loose or missing at the end of the Sonoma (Calif.) Raceway event June 25. ... Saturday was a NASCAR doubleheader. The Xfinity Series race, scheduled for Friday night, was delayed until Saturday for rain. Some drivers, including Joey Logano, Daniel Suarez, Brendan Gaughan, Elliott Sadler, Ty Dillon, Ryan Sieg, and Erik Jones ran both races.Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Race -- Coke Zero 400 Powered by Coca-ColaDaytona International SpeedwayDaytona Beach, FloridaSaturday, July 1, 20171.

NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. consumers have filed a lawsuit against Kobe Steel Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp accusing the companies of violating consumer protection laws and engaging in fraud by concealing the use of sub-standard metal components in vehicles.The proposed class action lawsuit represents the first U.S. consumer complaint filed against Kobe Steel over an issue that has been dogging Japan’s third-largest steelmaker for nearly five decades.Kobe, which supplies steel parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to about 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil.The lawsuit, filed on Monday in federal court in San Francisco, was brought by two California residents who seek to represent a nationwide class of consumers who bought allegedly defective Toyota vehicles.According to the complaint, Toyota’s Prius, Camry, Land Cruiser and Lexus vehicles have all been manufactured with “sub-standard�� steel, aluminum and copper.The plaintiffs allege that Toyota and Kobe Steel both violated federal and state consumer protection laws by claiming that the vehicles complied with U.S. quality standards.Kobe Steel could not immediately be reached for comment. Toyota did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a special order in November, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked 29 automakers, including Toyota, to disclose the safety of any of their vehicles or engines containing products supplied by Kobe Steel.The regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what data it had received in response and whether there was any evidence of faulty materials in Toyota cars.Monday’s 40-page lawsuit outlines the ways in which the companies allegedly concealed poor metal quality. It demands compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount.According to the complaint, at least six Toyota car models sold or leased to U.S. consumers were manufactured with sub-standard metal from Kobe Steel. Plaintiffs said the metal could impact vehicle safety and performance.Toyota had the duty to disclose any defective vehicle components because it has consistently marketed its automobiles as safe, functional and reliable, the lawsuit says.Kobe and Toyota had superior knowledge and access to the facts, the lawsuit alleged, giving rise to fraud by concealment claims.Kobe is also undergoing a separate U.S. Justice Department probe.

(Adds total U.S. industry sales for full year, BMW ranking as No. 1 luxury brand in U.S., other details)DETROIT, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Automakers reported strong December U.S. sales on Monday, boosted by falling gasoline prices, but industry executives and analysts cautioned that growth would slow in 2015 after five years of rapid recovery from the recession.General Motors Co easily beat analysts�� expectations, logging a 19 percent gain to 274,483 vehicles, the best December for the No. 1 U.S. automaker in seven years. Ford Motor Co’s December sales of 220,671 were up just 1.2 percent, missing expectations.“U.S. auto sales are dancing to a very different (and we believe unsustainable) beat,�� Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note.He suggested U.S. auto demand has outpaced economic, wage and housing growth rates, thanks largely to easy credit access for consumers.Even as the pace of sales growth is expected to slow this year, modest growth to the 16.7 million to 17 million vehicles seen by analysts is still encouraging, several company executives have recently said. Any deceleration in U.S. growth could be damaging at a time when other global markets are slowing.On Monday, Jeff Bracken, head of Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand in the United States, said of 2015, “Any way you slice it, whether it’s 16.7 (million vehicles) or slightly below or above, it’s still a very healthy industry.”Toyota executives said they conservatively expect 2015 sales of 16.7 million vehicles, while others, including LMC Automotive, expect this year’s sales to hit 17 million.In December, sales of pickup trucks and large SUVs surged, spurred by low gasoline prices.Sales of GM pickup trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra surged 35 percent to 81,273, outpacing the F-Series pickups from Ford, which were flat at 74,355 vehicles. Ford’s F-150 pickup truck sales remain limited due to the rollout of a new version.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Ram Truck brand pickup sales soared 32 percent to 44,222 vehicles.Auto sales are an early indicator each month of consumer spending. Sales in December rose almost 11 percent to more than 1.5 million vehicles, according to research firm Autodata, finishing in line with analysts�� expectations.U.S. average gasoline prices are 34 percent lower than a year ago, and in much of the country are less than $2 per gallon.Full-year sales for 2014 finished just above 16.5 million vehicles, matching the tally in 2006. Rising demand has allowed automakers to boost prices for their vehicles, however.Kelley Blue Book, an industry source for vehicle valuations, said Monday the average transaction price for a new vehicle sold in the U.S. market in December was a record $34,367, up 2.5 percent from a year ago.GM’s December transaction prices grew 4 percent from a year earlier to $38,816, KBB said.Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. sales jumped 20 percent in December on strong Jeep SUV and pickup truck sales, but still missed analysts�� expectations. FCA’s sales of 193,261 for the month were the highest since 2006 for the company once known as Chrysler.Nissan Motor Co said on Monday its December U.S. sales grew 7 percent, stronger than expected, while Honda Motor Co’s 1.5 percent increase fell short of expectations.In addition, Germany’s BMW reclaimed the U.S. luxury crown last year, topping Daimler’s Mercedes brand by more than 9,000 vehicles.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp said they plan to establish a joint company to develop “connected�� services to be used in homes and urban development.The tie-up deepens the partnership between the companies, which in January announced a joint venture to build electric-vehicle (EV) batteries, pooling the R&amp;D and manufacturing strengths of one of the world’s largest automakers and battery makers to compete in the fast-growing EV market.In their latest venture, Toyota and Panasonic said they will set up a new company early next year to focus on technology that could be used to offer personalized services in the home. The pair plan to be 50-50 partners in the new firm and will increase cooperation at their respective housing operations in Japan.“We will put our respective strengths together to offer new value in everyday life,�� Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga said in a joint statement on Thursday.The move comes at a time when lower-emissions vehicles and ride-sharing services have opened up the auto industry to new competitors, leaving traditional car makers and their suppliers scrambling to find alternate revenue streams.Toyota has been developing connected cars that can share information on usage - data that could be leveraged for on-demand ride-sharing, insurance and maintenance.The automaker has said it will tap into its partner network and its operations which range from building and selling cars, homes and companion robots to expand into new transportation and home energy services.“If we are able to use this network going forward not only to manufacture and sell vehicles but to also provide new services, our future possibilities will greatly expand,�� President Akio Toyota told reporters on Wednesday.“In addition to cars, I think that having our own housing business and connected business will be a big advantage for us.��	3.494803889
SHANGHAI, Sept 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co expects to sell three million cars in China for the second straight year in 2014, its China President Matthew Tsien said on Wednesday.Tsien made the remarks at a media event in Shanghai.GM sold 2.26 million vehicles in China during the first eight months of the year, up 11.1 percent from a year earlier.GM has said it expects its China sales to expand 8-10 percent this year, roughly in line with overall growth of China’s auto market.GM, which sells cars in China under brands including Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, competes with global rivals such as Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp in the world’s biggest auto market.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T President Akio Toyoda earned 352 million yen ($2.84 million) in total compensation last year after his bonus doubled to about $2 million, the Japanese company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.Toyoda, head of the world’s best-selling automaker, received a bonus of 249 million yen in the year ended March, up from 127 million yen in the previous year. His base salary was unchanged.Toyoda's compensation is roughly a third of what Nissan Motor Co 7201.T paid Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn in the same period. Ghosn told shareholders on Tuesday he splits his time equally between Nissan and French alliance partner Renault SA RENA.PA, which he also heads.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI CEO Sergio Marchionne was the top-paid automotive executive in 2014, making about 31.3 million euros ($35 million).Toyota in May reported a 19 percent rise in net profit to 2.17 trillion yen for the business year through March, and forecast a third consecutive year of record profit.Nissan’s net profit grew 18 percent to 457.6 billion yen.	-2.283680581
(The online version of this October 6 story was refiled to fix spelling error in headline)Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand unveiled a full-sized cardboard version of their new IS saloon in London on Monday (October 5). The intricate design was created to celebrate the skills of Lexus’s ��takumi�� craftsmen and women who work on the productions lines in Japan.The so-called ‘Origami Car�� has a cardboard frame crafted from 1,700 recyclable laser-cut cardboard sheets. It’s powered by an electric motor, meaning it can actually be driven, albeit never in a practical - or legal - scenario.Despite the unconventional building material, Toyota’s Scott Brownlee said the styling mimicked the shape and curves of the real version.“Styling on cars is all about surfacing and angles, and how things change as you move around them; how does a car’s shape evolve from the front to the side to the back. And what was interesting was when they were making this is that you can pick up some of that. So even though it’s in a completely different material, in fact at some angles you can see through it because of the corrugation, you still get that sense of surfaces moving between each other,�� Scott told Reuters.The Origami Car celebrates the design and engineering skill of the Lexus production lines in Japan where the workers hone their dexterity skills by learning how to fold paper into a origami paper cat, using only their non-dominant hand.Professional origami designer Mark Bolitho said: “This car is inspired, the inspiration was the engineers can make a paper cat and they can take it further using the same materials, the same underlying inspiration which is a folded paper object and come up with what you see today.”Built by London-based specialist companies, the Origami Car presented unique challenges for those involved.Ruben Marcos, founder of company Scales and Models, said: “The hinges and the weights and whole structural issue, that was really I think one of the hardest parts.”It took five people three months and 2,500 hours to turn the computer aided design (CAD) into the full-size corrugated cardboard replica.While cardboard cars may not be the future of motoring, the designers enjoyed being involved in a project that had a link with the past.“What makes it a sculptural piece rather than an engineering piece because we have to make adaptations like that and it’s not perfect in a CAD sense, it’s got a human touch in it. And I think that’s what Lexus liked about it as well; it’s a link back to their origami,�� said Daniel Ryan, from company Laser Cut Works.The unique vehicle will be on display to the public at the Grand Designs exhibition in Birmingham from October 8.	-0.3099510604
DETROIT, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation into whether General Motors Co reacted fast enough in its recall of more than 1.6 million cars over an ignition-switch defect linked to 13 deaths in crashes.The issue could prove costly to GM as the automaker faces a potential fine from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the cost of replacing the ignition switches in question and the possibility of costly lawsuits.“The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation into the timeliness of General Motors�� recall of faulty ignition switches to determine whether GM properly followed the legal processes and requirements for reporting recalls,�� the safety agency said in a statement released on Wednesday.GM, which went through a bankruptcy restructuring in 2009, could face a maximum fine of $35 million if it failed to notify NHTSA within five days of a recall after learning of a vehicle safety defect.The company did not say how much the recall would cost, but LMC Automotive analyst Jeff Schuster said the biggest cost to the automaker could result from the flurry of lawsuits likely to be triggered by the defect and the company’s actions.Toyota Motor Corp last year paid more than $1 billion to resolve economic-loss claims related to the recall of millions of vehicles for unintended acceleration. The Japanese automaker is still trying to settle personal-injury lawsuits.GM’s recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off.GM previously said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the “run�� position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components.NHTSA urged owners to follow GM’s recommendation to “use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring�� when operating the vehicle and seek the repair as soon as replacement parts become available. GM said the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.NHTSA said it will monitor the recall and take additional action as needed. Up to now, Toyota Motor Corp and Ford Motor Co have paid the largest fines of more than $17 million to NHTSA for delaying recalls.On Tuesday GM more than doubled its recall related to the issue, saying it was “deeply sorry�� and that the company was reviewing its recall process, acknowledging it was not as “robust as it should have been.”GM said then that it was aware of 31 reported incidents, including 13 front-seat fatalities, involving frontal crashes in which the condition may have caused or contributed to the front airbags not deploying.On Thursday, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra declined to address the issue at an event in Boston. But the company said in a statement: “We deeply regret the events that led to the recall and this investigation. As our detailed chronology indicates, we intend to fully cooperate with NHTSA and we welcome the opportunity to help the agency have a full understanding of the facts.”GM previously said all the crashes occurred off-road and at high speeds, where the probability of serious or fatal injuries was high regardless of airbag deployment. Failure to wear seat belts and alcohol use also were factors in some cases, the company said.Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington advocacy group that pushed for the wider recall, said the whole recall system is broken. “GM doesn’t get a get-out-of-jail-free card just because NHTSA did a sloppy job,�� he said.In light of GM’s bigger recall, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, on Wednesday called on NHTSA to require automakers to provide detailed information to the agency when they become aware of accidents involving deaths. He said GM was aware of fatal accidents in Maryland and Wisconsin in 2005 and 2006 involving safety issues and notified dealers, but did not recall the vehicles involved.“The current early warning reporting system is too little, too late,�� he said in a statement. “We need to overhaul the early warning reporting system so that NHTSA is not looking at auto defects through a rear-view mirror.”David Strickland, who was head of NHTSA from January 2010 until December 2013 and oversaw NHTSA’s investigation of Toyota, said it was too soon to blame NHSTA for failing to act sooner.Strickland, now a partner at Venable LLP, a law firm that represents the auto industry, said the agency’s probe will focus more on the timeliness of GM’s response to the problem than on the number of deaths or injuries related to the ignition issue.“They’ll try to figure out when the manufacturer knew it had a defect that posed a risk to safety,�� he said.Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Arthur Henry said recalls typically do not hurt automakers�� brand image. GM’s recall and the media fervor around it is reminiscent of what Toyota went through in 2009 and 2010, he said, when it recalled more than 19 million vehicles globally related to unintended acceleration.“Toyota has shown that a brand can recover from an incident like this and what may help GM is the fact that the majority of the models recalled are discontinued,�� he said. “This may dissolve any negative projection toward its new products.”Earlier this month, GM said it was recalling 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 compact cars from model years 2005 through 2007. On Tuesday, it added 842,103 Saturn Ion compact cars from 2003 through 2007 model years, Chevy HHR mid-sized vehicles from 2006 and 2007, and the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007.A spokesman for GM’s Europe unit, Opel, said the 2007 Opel GT Roadster, which was based on the same platform as the Solstice and Sky, also is affected, adding around 2,300 more vehicles to the recall.GM no longer makes any of the affected cars.It previously said it is working with suppliers to increase production of replacement parts. GM said the ignition switch torque performance may not meet company specifications. The involved parts were made in Mexico, according to documents previously filed with NHTSA.Of the cars recalled, 1,367,146 vehicles are in the United States, 235,855 are in Canada, 15,073 are in Mexico and 2,591 were exported outside North America, according to GM.GM said in documents filed with NHTSA that it first learned of the issue in 2004, around the time of the 2005 Cobalt launch with a report of at least one incident where a Cobalt lost engine power because the key moved out of the “run�� position.The company later issued a bulletin alerting dealers to advise owners of the issue.In March 2007, NHTSA officials alerted GM to a fatal Cobalt crash from July 2005 in which the front airbags did not deploy, according to the NHTSA documents. While GM’s legal department had opened a file on that crash in September 2005, GM employees meeting with NHTSA in 2007 were unaware of the crash.In late July 2011, a meeting of GM legal staff and engineers led to the an investigation of crashes in which airbags did not deploy, according to the NHTSA documents.	-2.081526453
* Keyless ignitions linked to carbon monoxide poisoning* 13 deaths attributed to alleged defect* U.S. lawsuit seeks automatic shut-off feature, damages (Adds judge’s assignment to lawsuit)Aug 26 (Reuters) - Ten of the world’s biggest automakers were sued on Wednesday by U.S. consumers who claim they concealed the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning in more than 5 million vehicles equipped with keyless ignitions, leading to 13 deaths.According to the complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, carbon monoxide is emitted when drivers leave their vehicles running after taking their electronic key fobs with them, under the mistaken belief that the engines will shut off.The 28 named plaintiffs said this can injure or have “deadly�� results for people who inhale the colorless and odorless gas, including when vehicles are left in garages attached to homes. They also said the defect reduces their vehicles�� resale values.A keyless ignition lets a driver start a vehicle by pushing an on-off button, instead of inserting a key, once the vehicle senses the presence of a nearby electronic fob.The defendants include BMW, including Mini; Daimler’s Mercedes Benz; Fiat Chrysler ; Ford Motor Co ; General Motors Co ; and Honda , including Acura.Also named as defendants were Hyundai, including Kia; Nissan, including Infiniti; Toyota, including Lexus; and Volkswagen, including Bentley.The lawsuit is the latest seeking to hold the automotive industry liable for defects that could make driving unsafe, such as Takata airbags and ignition switches on GM vehicles.The lawsuit claimed that the 10 automakers have long known about the risks of keyless ignitions, which have been available in the United States since at least 2003, yet deceived drivers by marketing their vehicles as safe.The plaintiffs said the automakers could have averted the 13 deaths, and many more injuries, by installing an inexpensive feature to automatically turn off unattended engines, and that GM and Ford even took steps to patent a shut-off feature.They said 27 complaints have been lodged with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration since 2009 over keyless ignitions.“The automakers had actual knowledge of the dangerous carbon monoxide poisoning consequences of vehicles with keyless fobs that lack an automatic shut-off,�� the complaint said.Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning kills about 430 people a year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The lawsuit seeks class-action status and an injunction requiring automakers to install automatic shut-off features on all existing and future vehicles sold with keyless ignitions. It also seeks compensatory and punitive damages.Ford said it takes customer safety “very seriously,�� and said its keyless ignition system has proven “safe and reliable.”BMW, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota declined to comment. None of the other automakers had an immediate comment.Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment. A U.S. Department of Transportation spokesman declined to comment on the NHTSA’s behalf.The lawsuit was filed in the same federal court in Los Angeles where Toyota has defended against claims that its vehicles accelerated unintentionally.U.S. District Judge James Selna in July 2013 approved a $1.6 billion settlement to resolve claims that Toyotas lost value because of that defect. The ignition lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte.The case is Draeger et al v. Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 15-06491.	-3.638036297
TOKYO (Reuters) - Angry Japanese parents joined bewildered teachers and businesses on Friday in a rush to find new ways to live and work for a month after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s shock call for all schools to close in a bid to stop coronavirus spreading.In another drastic move, the northern island of Hokkaido, which has seen the largest number of cases in Japan, late on Friday declared a state of emergency, telling its population of about 5 million people, including residents of Sapporo city, to refrain from venturing outside their homes over the weekend.Abe’s unprecedented move on Thursday to ask local authorities to shut schools means students will be out from Monday at least until the new academic year starts in early April.The abrupt step drew scathing criticism, with health officials left scratching their heads and analysts saying the plan was politically motivated and made little sense. Local authorities also criticized the move and at least one prefecture and several cities rejected the request to close its schools.“I’m going to have to babysit my grandkids every other day,�� business owner Mieko Hamada, 56, told Reuters on her way to their house in central Tokyo.“My daughter works and can’t look after them, and their babysitter also refused. It’s utter chaos,�� she said, adding that while she had her own business to run she had no choice but to ask subordinates to cover for her.Under intense questioning in parliament, Abe appeared to signal a willingness to soften the call for mass closures, saying it was merely the government’s “basic thinking�� and that schools and local authorities should “make their decisions flexibly.”He pledged to take policy steps as needed to prevent the outbreak from dealing a severe blow to Japan’s fragile economic recovery. Earlier in the week, the government had already urged large gatherings, sports fixtures and cultural gatherings be scrapped or curtailed, but pledged the 2020 summer Olympic Games would go ahead in Tokyo.Infections in Japan have topped 200, with five deaths - including one on Friday of a man in his seventies. That excludes more than 700 cases and five more deaths from the quarantined cruise liner Diamond Princess, docked in the port of Yokohama.While the virus has hit China hardest so far, causing nearly 80,000 infections and almost 2,800 deaths, its rapid spread globally in the past week has stoked fresh alarm.As Abe prepared to hold a news conference on Saturday evening, surprise at the scale of his request reverberated around the country, with local government and health officials left with few clues on how to implement it.“We will continue to urge public services and private companies to make it easier for people to take time off,�� Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference, without disclosing further details. Finance Minister Taro Aso said financial support for families was under review.In western Japan, Shimane prefecture - which has had no coronavirus cases - simply said it had no intention of closing its schools for now.Hokkaido had already announced a closure of all schools until March 4, providing a foretaste of the complexities of such moves. A hospital had to close doors to patients without reservations on Friday because a fifth of its nurses were unable to work with children out of school.“We don’t know how this could be extended further,�� an official at the facility, JA Hokkaido Koseiren Obihiro Kosei Hospital, told Reuters.As the coronavirus spreads, more companies said they would allow workers to telecommute. But a survey in the Nikkei business daily published on Friday, conducted before Abe’s announcement, showed only half of major firms were telling all or some employees to work at home.As the government faced questions on how businesses would cope with a March shutdown of schools, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co said they were still discussing how their factories would deal with school closures.Hitachi Ltd said it would let workers with children in school - or about 10,000 employees - work at home in March.Zoos, aquariums and other leisure facilities also said they would close: Tokyo Disneyland, DisneySea and Universal Studios Japan will be shut from Saturday through March 15.Abe has come under fire for what critics say is a lack of leadership and Japan’s seemingly cautious approach to testing for the virus, especially compared with South Korea, which was preparing to test more than 200,000 members of a church at the heart of a surge in its outbreak.He also caught flak in parliament and social media on Friday after revelations an aide had held a buffet-style fund-raising party with about 200 attendees on Feb. 26 - the same day the premier asked for sports and cultural events to be scaled down.Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University’s Japan campus, said Abe’s move on schools was plainly political in the wake of surveys showing growing public dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of the outbreak.“Suddenly, he sees the political consequences of being seen as missing in action,�� Kingston said, noting his support had fallen to around 36% in a weekend poll. “He’s outsourcing responsibility to local governments and corporations.”Experts also questioned the efficacy of the government’s move on schools.“This is one example of a nationwide plan that has a slim chance of succeeding because the extent the coronavirus has spread differs across regions,�� Kentaro Iwata, a professor specializing in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, tweeted.He added that it “made no sense�� to close schools outside of Hokkaido.Interactive graphic tracking coronavirus: here	-4.229445507
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects hybrid cars to make up 20 percent of its total vehicle sales in India by 2020 from less than 2 percent today, a senior company official told Reuters.Toyota, which already sells the Camry hybrid in India, plans to introduce hybrid technology in models like the Corolla and Prius sedans and could introduce it for sport-utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles, Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota’s India business said on Wednesday.The Japanese carmaker also plans to work with its low-cost car-making division, Daihatsu, to develop clean fuel technology vehicles for emerging markets like India, Tachibana said, where affordability is an issue.The development costs of hybrid vehicles means they are out of reach for a vast majority of India’s first-time car buyers, which then makes it difficult for carmakers to achieve the volumes needed to bring down the price.For instance, Toyota’s Camry hybrid is priced starting at 3.3 million rupees ($47,932), about 15 times the price of a petrol variant of one of India’s top-selling small cars.Toyota will work to increase the amount of components it sources from the Indian domestic market to bring down the overall cost of manufacturing hybrids, Tachibana said.Several Indian cities have high levels of air pollution partly caused by automobiles. Earlier this month, New Delhi shut schools, put construction projects on hold and advised people to stay indoors as part of an “emergency�� plan to deal with dangerous levels of air pollution.Authorities in New Delhi also began revoking licenses for diesel vehicles more than 15 years old which could remove as many as 200,000 cars from the city’s roads. Late last year, the country’s top court banned the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi.“We think that hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology is the best solution in India,�� Tachibana said, adding that this clean fuel technology is also needed to meet India’s stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms starting in 2017.Toyota’s sales in India rose about 3 percent in the first seven months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, compared with the same period a year ago, according to India’s auto industry body the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.The number of Toyota vehicles sold for that period was 83,633, according to auto industry body data and Toyota’s market share was 5 percent.Total passenger vehicle sales in India rose 11 percent over the same period to 1.77 million.	1.349745331
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday its transmission factory in northern Japan was preparing to resume production some time during the night shift starting at 8:30 p.m. (1130 GMT), after a powerful quake halted work last week.The shutdown of the transmissions factory in Tomakomai on the island of Hokkaido halted production at 16 of Toyota’s 18 domestic assembly plants on Monday. Toyota said it would decide in the next few hours on production plans for Tuesday.The 6.7-magnitude quake in Hokkaido last Thursday killed dozens of people and temporarily cut off power on the island. Power was restored to Toyota’s transmissions plant on Saturday and production facilities are being checked for a restart, Toyota said.	-1.174693741
DETROIT, May 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling 637,000 vehicles in the United States as part of a massive expansion of a global recall to replace potentially defective air bags that could rupture and send shrapnel into occupants.The vehicles are being recalled in three separate campaigns, according to documents posted early Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The air bags were supplied by Japan’s Takata Corp. More than 36 million vehicles equipped with Takata air bags and sold by 10 manufacturers have been recalled worldwide since mid-2009.Earlier this week, Toyota in Japan said it would expand its global air bag recalls by nearly 5 million vehicles.As part of that effort, Toyota is recalling 300,000 vehicles sold in high-humidity U.S. states and territories, including the 2005-2007 Corolla, Corolla Matrix and Sequoia, 2005-2006 Tundra and 2005-2007 Lexus SC, as well as the 2005-2007 Pontiac Vibe made for General Motors Co.Toyota is also recalling 177,000 2003-2004 Tundra and 2004 Sequoia, as well as 160,000 2004-2005 RAV4.With all of the recalls, NHTSA said “the inflator could rupture, with metal fragments striking and potentially seriously injuring�� vehicle occupants.In a statement, Toyota’s U.S. subsidiary said “multiple investigations into the root cause of the potential for inflator rupture are taking place.�� (Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Bernadette Baum)	-2.811446604
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday reported a 23% drop in U.S. new vehicle sales in August versus the same month in 2019, as a two-month industrywide shutdown of auto production in the spring to halt the spread of COVID-19, as well as an uncertain economic recovery, weighed on sales.This was Toyota’s fifth straight month of U.S. sales declines.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co said its U.S. sales fell 8.4% in August, largely due to a decline in fleet sales to rental car companies, government agencies and corporations. Hyundai had posted a slight sales gain in July.Automakers have struggled to get inventory to dealers to replenish stocks following the pandemic-fueled shutdowns.This has enabled them to scale back consumer discounts on popular models and raise vehicle prices.According to consultancies LMC and J.D. Power, which had predicted industrywide U.S. new vehicle sales to be down 20% in August, nearly 45% of vehicles sold during the month spent fewer than 20 days on dealer lots, 35 percentage points more than the previous year.TrueCar Inc subsidiary ALG said on Tuesday that the average transaction price for vehicles was up 3.9% in August versus the same month in 2019.While U.S. demand for new vehicles has remained stronger than expected after driving off a cliff in March and April as a number of states shut down because of the coronavirus, there is plenty of uncertainty over whether a sustained recovery is possible.Outbreaks of COVID-19 across southern and southwestern U.S. states during the summer appear to have slowed the economic recovery. Unemployment remains high and could weigh further on sales moving forward.	-2.529284489
KARIYA Japan (Reuters) - Denso Corp 6902.T, the world's second-biggest car-parts supplier, does not plan to join global rivals in bulking up through a big merger but it is looking to buy smaller parts makers with niche technologies, the company's head said.German car-parts supplier ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] last month agreed to buy U.S.-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp TRW.N, a combination that will would surpass Denso in revenues and be second to Germany's Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL]. “We have no intention to acquire a big company,�� Chief Executive Nobuaki Katoh told Reuters.“But there are companies that are small while having specific technologies that stand out, and if it’s possible we would like to acquire companies like that,�� he said in an interview this week. He declined to specify any companies.The competitive landscape of the automotive-parts industry is shifting as the world's biggest automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, increasingly use common or modular parts in their vehicles, giving an upper hand to big global suppliers with a wide range of technologies.“Automotive parts are becoming more modular and systematized based on their functions, and their structures are becoming more complicated,�� Katoh said. “That means it might not be possible for a single company to meet the demands of automakers.”Denso, which is 22.3 percent owned by Toyota and is a major supplier to the Japanese giant, could also cooperate with other firms to jointly develop technologies and products, Katoh said.Customers increasingly expect parts suppliers to move beyond their traditional products and supply such gear as infotainment systems and self-driving technology.Denso, spun off from Toyota in 1949, manufactures a range of traditional automotive parts such as gasoline and diesel fuel-injection systems and air conditioners. Recently, it has moved into automated driving technology and infotainment.Last year, it invested in Adasens Automotive, a German-based company that develops driver-assistance systems using cameras, a move aimed to strengthen Denso’s image-recognition technologies.In the coming years, Denso will focus on developing advanced driver assistance and active safety systems, Katoh said.Denso has expanded its global capacity rapidly. Last year, it started operating a new 4.2 billion yen ($39 million) plant in India and in March a 9.4 billion yen plant in Indonesia. It invested 10.7 billion yen to expand capacity at a Mexican plant.“Global suppliers need to have the ability to manufacture and supply products all around the world and to be capable of combining several technologies to be offered as a system �� such as safety systems, environmental systems or power-train systems �� rather than a single component,�� Katoh said.Denso, Japan's 14th-biggest company by market value, relies on the Toyota group -- Daihatsu Motor 7262.T and Hino Motors 7205.T -- for 48.8 percent of revenue but Katoh reiterated the stance to expand the share from other automotive clients.“It’s not that we will have less business with Toyota, but rather we are going to boost our business with other customers,�� he said.	2.072939962
"DETROIT (Reuters) - January U.S. car sales by the three Detroit-based automakers topped analysts�� expectations, as low gasoline prices and easy credit terms helped fuel sales of utility vehicles and big pickups.Full-size trucks and SUVs are among the industry’s most profitable vehicles. But some companies were having trouble supplying dealers with enough of those high-margin models in January.Sales of trucks and SUVs accounted for 69 percent of January sales at General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI, compared with 66 percent a year ago, according to a Reuters analysis.GM said on Tuesday that January sales rose 18 percent to 202,786 vehicles, while Ford said sales were up 15 percent to 178,351. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 201,436 and 173,431, respectively.Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. arm said January sales rose 14 percent to 145,007 vehicles, against analysts�� expectations of 144,476.""As the price of gasoline goes down, people want to buy bigger vehicles that go faster,"" said Mike Jackson, chief executive officer of AutoNation Inc AN.N. ""That's just human nature.""Ford sold a record 54,370 F-series pickups in January and said the redesigned 2015 F-150 remained in short supply, particularly high-end versions including the King Ranch and Platinum editions.GM said combined sales of its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups were up 22 percent to 48,727. Sales of the automaker’s new mid-size Colorado and Canyon pickups totaled 8,147.At Fiat Chrysler, Jeep sales climbed 23 percent and Ram trucks rose 21 percent.January sales topped expectations at Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, but lagged at Honda Motor Co 7267.T.Toyota sales of 169,194 were up 16 percent, including record sales by its premium Lexus brand.Sales at Nissan jumped 15 percent to 104,107. Nissan’s performance was driven in part by strong results of its Rogue, Pathfinder and Murano utility vehicles, as well as its Versa, Sentra and Altima sedans.Honda said record January sales of 102,184 were up 12 percent from a year ago, narrowly missing analysts�� expectations. Sales of the Civic and Accord were down, but the best-selling CR-V crossover jumped 22 percent.Chrysler’s U.S. industry sales in January were projected at an annual rate of 17.0 million, including about 300,000 medium and heavy trucks.A Reuters survey of 47 analysts estimated an annual rate of 16.6 million, which does not include the larger trucks."	1.665661743
WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. highway safety regulator, NHTSA, expanded its warning on Tuesday about faulty airbags made by Japanese auto-part maker Takata to 6.1 million vehicles in the United States.“The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urges owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors vehicles to act immediately on recall notices to replace defective Takata airbags,�� it said in a statement.“Over six million vehicles are involved in these recalls, which have occurred as far back as 18 months ago and as recently as Monday,�� it added.

(Adds comment, detail)BEIJING, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The former deputy head of China’s top planning agency confessed in court on Wednesday to extensive bribery involving several companies including a Toyota Motor Corp. joint venture, the court said.Liu Tienan, 59, was sacked as deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a post that carries ministerial-level status, in May last year. He is one of the highest-profile officials to be prosecuted for corruption since President Xi Jinping launched an anti-graft campaign.Prosecutors charged Liu and his son, Liu Decheng, with taking 35.6 million yuan ($5.8 million) in bribes in dealings with various companies, including the Toyota joint venture, the court said.The NDRC is a powerful body that sets broad economic policies and approves major investments. Liu was also head of the National Energy Administration regulator.“The oral representation made by the defendant Liu Tienan on the allegations is: I have taken the initiative to confess to the facts of the allegations,�� the court said on its microblog as it laid out the charges against Liu.The closely watched trial in being held in Langfang city in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing.Liu was sacked after a deputy editor-in-chief of the investigative magazine Caijing posted accusations on his microblog that Liu was involved in illegal activities.He was the first ministerial-level official to face an investigation after Xi became Communist Party head in late 2012 and pledged to take down high-ranking “tigers�� and low-ranking “flies�� in his fight against a pervasive problem he says could threaten Communist Party rule.Liu broke into tears as he confessed and apologised for his crimes in his closing statement, the court said.“I’m so sorry that I worked more than 30 years at the NDRC, with the trust of the leaders and my comrades, and smeared a black mark on my workplace,�� Liu was quoted as saying. “I am completely and bitterly remorseful.”�I’ve harmed myself with my corrupt actions, harmed my child, and destroyed my family,�� he said.Liu is the third ministerial-level official to stand trial for graft, according to Chinese media.Under Chinese law, Liu could face the death sentence if convicted of corruption. But the public prosecutor said in an opinion that Liu had been cooperative in handing over evidence to investigators so the court would be lenient.“Liu Tiennan, after his case was opened, positively assisted the organisations handling the case in their work, and his attitude was good in admitting and regretting his crimes,�� the prosecutor stated.Liu is certain to be found guilty as the Communist Party controls the courts, which do not challenge party accusations, especially in graft cases.Prosecutors said Liu, together with his son, facilitated deals on projects that included the sale of 30,000 tonnes of aluminium oxide to the Nanshan Group, parent of Shandong Nanshan Aluminium Co. Ltd..In return, the father and son were paid bribes of 7.5 million yuan by Song Zuowen, chairman of Nanshan Group, the court heard.In 2002, Liu Tienan, as a senior official in the top economic planning agency, had helped Nanshan Group get approval for an alloy project after a request from Song, according to the court.In 2005, Liu Tienan accepted a request from Sun Yonggen, chairman of the Ningbo ZhongJin Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to approve a petrochemical plant, the court said. In return, Sun bought Liu Decheng a car for 336,000 yuan.Liu also put Zhang Aibin, the controlling shareholder of a car dealership in Beijing, in touch with Zhang Fangyou, the chairman of GAC Toyota Motor Co. Ltd, a joint venture between GAC Group and Toyota, so Zhang could set up a GAC Toyota Motor shop, according to the court transcript.Tokyo-based Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the company was checking the facts: “So we would like to refrain from commenting.”The trial has offered a rare glimpse into the amount of power amassed by top officials, especially within the NDRC. The agency sets policy for strategic industries, approves big investments, mergers and acquisitions, and has the authority to influence prices for everything from liquor to gasoline.Since Xi launched his campaign against corruption, 49 ministerial-level officials have “fallen��, according to People’s Daily newspaper.State media reported that Liu had taken bribes for helping a businessman to defraud banks of loans of more than $200 million in 2011 for an investment in Canada.Key information on that case initially came from a former mistress in Japan, media reported.

Field set for Chase for CupBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed for The Sports XchangeRICHMOND, Va. -- Joe Gibbs Racing brought guns to a knife fight on Saturday night at Richmond International Raceway.But JGR’s Matt Kenseth did his teammates one better -- he brought a howitzer.Leading 352 of 400 laps in a race he owned from the outset, Kenseth pulled away from Kyle Busch after a restart with 18 laps left and won the Federated Auto Parts 400 by .951 seconds over his teammate.Kenseth’s fourth victory of the season, tying him for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series lead with Jimmie Johnson and Busch, meant the 16 drivers who started the race in playoff-eligible positions stayed there.Jamie McMurray (13th-place finisher), Jeff Gordon (seventh), Ryan Newman (20th), Clint Bowyer (10th) and Paul Menard (26th) all earned berths in the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup based on position in the standings - without a victory between them.Joey Logano ran third on Saturday night, followed by Aric Almirola, whose gallant bid to crack the Chase grid fell 17 points short of the final position claimed by Menard.Dale Earnhardt Jr. came home fifth.The victory was Kenseth’s second at Richmond and the 35th of his career. Joe Gibbs Racing has won seven of the last nine NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races, with Logano the only other driver to score a win during that stretch.“Man, these guys gave me a great car,�� Kenseth said. “Thanks to (crew chief) Jason (Ratcliff) and all these guys standing behind me. They had the pit stops we needed, held serve every time and kept us out in front.“We were really superb in the long run. I had to work for it pretty hard in the short run. I was disappointed to see that last caution (called for debris on the backstretch on Lap 375). I knew it was going to be tough, but we were able to get the jump to get out front.”Emblematic of JGR’s dominance at Richmond was a restart on Lap 126.Hamlin surged from fourth to first on the restart lap, pulling his three teammates with him. The four Gibbs cars quickly separated from fifth-place Kyle Larson, establishing a gap of two seconds back to the No. 42.Kenseth overtook Hamlin for the top spot on Lap 139, but for 60 straight laps the JGR teammates ran 1-2-3-4, until McMurray (who had qualified for the Chase simply by taking the green flag to start the race) passed Carl Edwards for the fourth position on Lap 186.The only suspense during that stretch came when Kenseth and Edwards rubbed fenders while fighting for position early in the run.That brief fracas gave team owner Joe Gibbs an anxious moment.“That’s the most nervous that I get in a race,�� Gibbs said. “Tonight I saw them up there. I saw some beating and banging there. I saw a hand come out the window, and I wasn’t sure what it was showing for a minute or two. I got a little nervous there.“I think that’s when I’m always the most nervous, when you got your cars up front and having a good night. Our guys, though, I think they all handled it the right way, it seems like. I know Matt came over the mic there and said his situation there with Carl, he kind of straightened that out, so I thought that was good.”Logano was the only non-JGR driver who could stay within hailing distance of Kenseth, but the ultimate third-place finisher stayed out on old tires for that restart on Lap 126 and did a creditable job holding the 10th spot before the fourth caution on Lap 209 gave him a chance to pit for fresh rubber.Almirola posted his best finish of the year, but it wasn’t enough.“I’m really proud of all my guys,�� Almirola said. “We worked our guts out all year long, and tonight was no different. I feel we’ve overachieved this year and really maximized our results week in and week out.“I’m disappointed to come up a few spots short, but we gave it all we had, and that is all we can do. We’ll go race these last 10 races and try to get a victory.”Notes: Roush Fenway Racing failed to place a car in the Chase for the first time in the organization’s history. ... McMurray and Menard earned Chase positions for the first time in their careers. ... Newman made the Chase without a victory for the second straight year. ... In his final season as a full-time Sprint Cup driver, Gordon qualified for his 11th Chase in 12 tries. ... The most bizarre moment of the race went to Michael McDowell, who grazed a safety truck in Turn 3 as the cars circulated under caution and ripped the right rear quarter panel off his car.NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Race -- Federated Auto Parts 400Richmond International RacewayRichmond, VirginiaSaturday, Sept. 12, 20151.

(Reuters) - A jury in California on Thursday found Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T not liable in one of the first wrongful death lawsuits to go to trial in the United States over alleged defects that caused some vehicles to unexpectedly accelerate.The closely watched case was brought by the husband and son of Noriko Uno, a 66-year old woman killed in a 2009 car crash involving a 2006 Toyota Camry.It is among hundreds of similar lawsuits facing Toyota over acceleration issues, which prompted the automaker to recall millions of vehicles since 2009.Uno’s vehicle was not subject to the acceleration-related recalls.According to their lawsuit, Uno’s Camry was struck by another vehicle, causing it to speed out of control down a busy California road until it hit a tree, killing Uno.Her family accused the automaker of failing to install brake-override systems that could have stopped out-of-control acceleration in vehicles sold in the U.S.The case is the first to go to trial in California over acceleration issues.“Regarding the verdict, we are gratified that the jury concluded the design of the 2006 Camry did not contribute to this unfortunate accident, affirming the same conclusion we reached after more than three years of careful investigation - that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle at issue in this case,�� a Toyota spokeswoman said in a statement.A lawyer for the family of Noriko Uno could not be immediately reached for comment.According to a recent regulatory filing from Toyota, around 200 proposed class actions and more than 500 individual cases have been filed against the company since February 2009 over the alleged acceleration issues.This week, a federal judge in California ruled that Toyota must face a trial over claims that it failed to warn the public about design defects that caused certain vehicles to accelerate unintentionally.That case was brought by the estate of Ida St. John, who said in 2009 that her 2005 Camry sped out of control and hit a school building. She died after giving that testimony, but the lawsuit does not claim that her death was caused by the crash.The trial, slated to begin November 5, will be one of the first of the many federal lawsuits focusing on the Toyota acceleration issues.The first federal sudden-acceleration case to go to trial ended with a win for Toyota in 2011, in a lawsuit brought by a doctor who worked in Brooklyn.	-3.782757311
FRANKFURT, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and private equity firm KKR have placed a 10.8 percent stake in German forklift maker Kion Group AG for a price of 29.50 euros a share, a source familiar with the transaction said on Tuesday.Earlier on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it will sell 10,681,388 Kion shares via an accelerated bookbuilding process.Based on the 29.50 euros a share price the share sale is worth about 315 million euros ($429 million). The placement is being made at a discount of about 4 percent to Tuesday’s closing share price of 30.75 euros.Kion, which listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange about six months ago, is the world’s second biggest maker of forklifts after Japan’s Toyota.	-2.06090947
BERLIN, July 14 (Reuters) - European car sales edged up 2.1 percent in June, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Toyota posting strong gains amid mixed signals from the region’s top five markets, according to industry data published on Friday.Registrations rose to 1.54 million cars last month in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, Brussels-based industry body ACEA said, from 1.51 million a year earlier. Half-year sales were up 4.6 percent to 8.46 million autos.In the 28-nation EU excluding Malta, registrations climbed 2.1 percent to 1.49 million vehicles, the highest level since 2007, the last year before the region’s six-year slump.Among major automotive groups, Toyota recorded the biggest monthly rise with a 12.9 percent gain, followed by Fiat Chrysler with 7.9 percent and Daimler with 4.2 percent.Still grappling with its diesel emissions scandal, Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaking group, saw deliveries rising 2.7 percent. Growth was held back by a 0.5 percent gain at the core namesake brand and a 1.4 percent drop at luxury division Audi.French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault grew 3.9 and 3 percent respectively while General Motors�� Opel division declined 6.9 percent as it nears its acquisition by PSA.Registrations fell in the region’s two largest markets Germany and Britain, by 3.5 percent and 4.8 percent, while Italy, France and Spain posted gains of 12.9 percent, 1.6 percent and 6.5 percent respectively, according to ACEA.

NAGOYA, Japan, July 23 (Reuters) - Mark Hogan, a former General Motors Co executive, says he often chided Toyota Motor Corp for its weakness in fast-growing Brazil and Argentina despite having reached the No. 1 spot in the global industry.To address perceived weak spots including an insular management style, the Japanese corporate giant has in recent months brought an infusion of outsiders - including Hogan - to its inner circle and put a foreigner in full control of its operations in Latin America, as well as several other overseas markets.Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s president and grandson of the company’s founder, has set out to open up the ranks of top management after concluding that Toyota had become too big and global for its traditionally closed and centrally controlled management style.Toyota’s management structure came under fire for its response to deadly accidents in the United States and ensuing recalls of millions of vehicles at the end of the last decade, which centred around cases of unintended acceleration.Executives at the headquarters in Toyota city, near Nagoya in central Japan, did not communicate well with U.S. staff, and decisions, made mostly at headquarters, came too late.Hogan, 62, was one of three outside board members Toyota appointed in June - the first such appointments in its 76-year-history and only the second non-Japanese to serve on the board.Nicholas Benes, representative director of The Board Director Training Institute of Japan, said research shows that the most successful global companies employ more foreigners on their board or in senior positions as their overseas sales increase.Toyota has only one foreigner on its 16-person board, but makes 75 percent of its sales abroad.The Toyota group has more room to grow abroad - as Hogan’s chiding about Latin America suggests - and new markets will be key to achieving growth targets including a record 9.91 million vehicle sales globally in 2013.Brazil’s auto market has more than doubled since 2005 and is now the world’s fourth largest, but Toyota’s market share there has been stuck around 3 percent, compared with nearly 15 percent in the U.S. market.“One of the few weaknesses of Toyota in the past, it’s been rather methodical, slow decision making process that eventually ended up here in Japan at all decisions no matter how global they were,�� Hogan told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday in Nagoya.Hogan said that, in addition to providing an outsider’s objective perspective to board discussions, he has been asked by Toyoda to help the company expand in Latin America by advising the recently appointed foreign executive overseeing the region.Hogan, the only non-Japanese among the three new outside directors, had worked at a Toyota-GM joint venture in California during his time at GM.He is not the first non-Japanese to serve on Toyota’s board, however. Jim Press, a soft-spoken man from Kansas who spent 37 years at Toyota, left abruptly to work for Chrysler in September 2007 just months after joining the Toyota board.Toyota is late in the game in bringing in external directors among Japanese companies, which have typically been considered more insular than global manufacturers in the West.Of companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section, 54.2 percent had outside directors in 2012, up from 43.7 percent in 2008, according to a TSE study.But Toyota is still hardly a model of diversity. Among 68 top executives, only seven are non-Japanese and just one, a corporate auditor, is female.	-1.105660671

(Recasts with total Canadian sales)TORONTO, July 2 (Reuters) - A healthy appetite for trucks and luxury cars pushed auto sales in Canada to a record high for June, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles the top seller, according to data released on Thursday.Overall sales nudged 1.2 percent higher to 177,857 cars and light trucks, making it the strongest June on record. Year-to-date sales were up 2.7 percent at 933,439 vehicles.“Ongoing gains being enjoyed by the luxury manufacturers in the Canadian market turned into a veritable feast in June,�� DesRosiers Automotive Consultants wrote in a note to clients.A handful of luxury brands exceeded gains of 25 percent, the automotive research firm said. Land Rover and Acura sales both rose 28 percent, with Porsche sales 26 percent higher.The strongest-performing full-line manufacturers included a 15 percent jump for General Motors to 24,226 vehicles, a 10 percent lift at Nissan to 11,623 vehicles, and a 10.5 percent gain at Toyota to 20,689 vehicles.GM and Toyota recorded big increases in pickup-truck sales, while Fiat Chrysler’s Dodge and Chrysler minivan sales rose 14 percent.Pickup and car sales fell at Ford, for a 13 percent overall decline to 26,784 vehicles.Fiat Chrysler said its Canadian sales notched a 1 percent rise to 27,217 vehicles, 6,186 of them minivans.The company’s Windsor, Ontario, van plant reopened in late May after a retooling. Its three-month closure had reduced supplies of some of the Canadian unit’s top-selling vehicles.Ram brand truck sales climbed 13 percent to 9,081, while Chrysler truck sales popped 164 percent higher to 1,863, offsetting an 8 percent drop in Dodge truck sales to 6,580 vehicles.GM Canada said it had a 15 percent increase in June sales with gains across its Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands.Total sales for Cadillac and Chevrolet brands rose 13 percent, while GMC sales increased 18 percent and Buick sales jumped 29 percent, the company said.Toyota’s Canadian sales rose to 20,689 vehicles as trucks climbed 19 percent to a record 10,750. Toyota said overall sales for the first half of the year were up 4.3 percent from the year-before period to 104,977 vehicles.In the United States, June auto sales rose to about 1.47 million vehicles, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier, according to figures compiled by WardsAuto.U.S. demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks helped GM and Ford offset slowing demand for sedans as it allowed them to raise truck and SUV prices.

TOKYO/DETROIT (Reuters) - A year ago, Japan’s Takata Corp, the world’s second-largest maker of auto safety parts, believed it had finally contained a crisis more than a decade in the making.It was wrong.More than a million Honda Motor Co Ltd vehicles could be subject to an upcoming recall for Takata air bags that are at risk of exploding and shooting shrapnel at passengers and drivers, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.That would be in addition to 7.6 million vehicles already recalled by Honda and other automakers over the past five years.And the total could grow further still if Honda’s rivals like Nissan, Mazda and BMW also decide to fix more vehicles that were made in a two-year period when, Takata says, it botched production of air bag inflators and lost related records.The possible additional recalls would come at a time when General Motors is under scrutiny over why it took more than a decade to discover a faulty ignition switch linked to at least 13 deaths. As automakers promote over-the-horizon breakthroughs like self-driving cars, the industry’s mass safety-related recalls underline how much can still go wrong with some of the cheapest, most established technologies.In April and May 2013, Takata’s customers, led by Honda and Toyota Motor Corp, recalled more than 4 million vehicles due to the risk that defective air bag inflators could blow apart and shoot metal shards into vehicles in the event of an accident.Those 2013 recalls, which ranked as the largest ever for an air bag defect, contributed to a $300 million charge for Takata.Takata and Honda told U.S. safety regulators that the core of the problem was how the explosive material used to inflate Takata air bags had been handled and processed between 2000 and 2002 at plants in the United States and Mexico.The 2013 recalls involving Honda and four other carmakers were intended to close the books on a problem that had emerged as early as 2007 and had already been linked to two deaths.But just weeks after the 2013 recalls, on May 14, a 10-year-old Honda Fit was involved in an accident in western Japan that raised doubts about whether these recalls had gone far enough.The Fit’s passenger-side air bag exploded, according to Honda and Japan’s transport ministry. There were no injuries in the accident, in Okayama, so police did not give details, but safety investigators found the metal ejected by the air bag was so hot it set fire to the instrument panel and glove compartment.Honda was immediately concerned. The Fit had not been part of earlier recalls and it raised a doubt about whether more defective parts could be in circulation than previously identified. Honda engineers spent six months but failed to recreate the explosion, the company said.In November, Honda told Japan’s safety regulators it was still investigating a new air bag explosion case but did not see the need for another recall. A month later, it said in a statement to Reuters: “We have confirmed that (Takata) has conducted cause analysis and implemented counter measures, and that in the production process it is taking preventive measures.”Then, this month, Honda’s larger rival, Toyota, recalled another 650,000 cars in Japan for defective Takata air bags and called back 1.6 million vehicles previously recalled overseas, an unusual step.A complication, Toyota said, was that Takata’s records had proven to be incomplete. Takata spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa confirmed that the company had discovered a problem with records kept at its plant in Monclova, Mexico.Short of replacement parts from Takata, Toyota has decided to turn off air bags in Japan as customers come to dealerships with recalled vehicles, judging an inoperable passenger-side air bag to be safer than a potentially defective one.Meanwhile, Honda is moving to expand its own recalls, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. That could include more than a million more vehicles. Honda could also recall the 2003 Fit. “If we decide it is necessary, we will take measures quickly,�� Honda said in a statement.Other automakers are expected to follow. Nissan said it would take “prompt action as necessary��. Mazda and Chrysler said they were investigating. BMW said it was in touch with Takata and regulators.Yet more vehicles could be recalled if an ongoing U.S. safety investigation finds evidence of wider problems.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is examining whether Takata inflators made after 2002 are prone to fail and whether driving in high humidity contributes to the risk for air bag explosions.That would go beyond the manufacturing glitches that Takata and Honda previously identified.In a statement, Takata said it had come to believe humidity could be contributing to air bag explosions. The company said it had been working with NHTSA for several months.“Takata is committed to the highest standards of safety for our customers and their customers,�� Takata Chief Executive Shigehisa Takada said in the statement. “Takata is committed to ensuring the safety and functionality of its air bag inflators, and we strive to avoid any malfunction.”Takata spokesman Alby Berman said he could not comment beyond the statement.Takada, who could not be reached directly for further comment, is the son of Juichiro Takada, who took his Tokyo-based family run business from seatbelts into the production of air bags from the late 1980s.Like other suppliers, Takata relies on auto manufacturers to make the final determination on the scope and timing of recalls and has typically left disclosure of defects to them.Since the recalls in April and May last year, there have been at least six cases of Takata inflators exploding in the United States and two in Japan.In August, an inflator ruptured in a 2005 Honda Civic in the United States, sending a “one-inch piece of shrapnel into the driver’s right eye��, according to a complaint filed with NHTSA.In January, a 2002 Toyota Corolla in Shizuoka, Japan had its air bag explode, sending hot shrapnel into the car. The passenger seat was burned, Toyota has said.NHTSA said this month it was examining whether moisture from humidity could be seeping inside inflators designed to be airtight. That could make the volatile propellant inside the inflators unstable, experts have said.NHTSA is also looking at Takata inflators supplied after 2002. Its probe includes an examination of air bag explosions in a 2005 Mazda 6, a 2006 Dodge Charger and a 2004 Nissan Sentra.Chrysler, maker of the Dodge Charger, had not previously been involved in the Takata recall. The Sentra had previously only been recalled for the 2002 and 2003 model years.Air bags, including those made by Takata, have saved thousands of lives since their widespread adoption in the 1990s, automakers, regulators and safety advocates agree.But in order to work, air bags need to inflate in less than half the time it takes to blink an eye, just 40 milliseconds on the passenger side, according to Takata. That requires the use of powerful and potentially dangerous explosives in inflators which require careful handling and precise calibration.In March 2006, Takata’s air bag plant in Monclova was rocked by a series of explosions that sent a fireball into the air.Takata uses ammonium nitrate in its inflators, Honda has said. That explosive compound is volatile and highly sensitive to moisture. Other air bag makers, including Takata’s larger Swedish rival, Autoliv Inc, have kept their inflator designs a proprietary secret.Takata identified several manufacturing problems with its inflators, including some at a plant in Moses Lake, Washington, and at Monclova, where the ammonium nitrate was exposed to too much moisture inside the air-conditioned plant.The manufacturing glitches meant the inflator propellant could burn too fast and blow apart the metal casing surrounding it, sending out hot gas and shrapnel. [ID:nL2N0KJ2QB]The recalls have been most costly for Honda. In May 2009, 18-year-old Ashley Parham was driving a 2001 Honda Accord when she bumped into a car in her high school parking lot outside Oklahoma City. The Accord’s air bag exploded and metal shrapnel sliced Parham’s carotid artery. She bled to death, one of two deaths linked to Takata air bags. Honda and Takata settled with Parham’s family out of court and details were not disclosed.Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategies and a witness for plaintiffs�� lawyers, said it was clear past Takata recalls, which began in 2008, had fallen short.“What’s very troubling is that they haven’t resolved this thing once and for all,�� he said.In Japan, drivers who began to respond to recall notices this week were sent home from Toyota dealerships with a yellow warning labels on the window visor.“Warning: Passenger Air Bag Inoperative,�� the warning reads. “We recommend you sit in the back seat. If you must sit in the front seat, push it all the way back and use a seatbelt.”Tomoki Nakagawa, 52, said he was stunned to find his mechanic had turned off the passenger air bag on his silver Noah minivan. He was told to avoid carrying passengers, advice that puzzled and frustrated him.“I bought a minivan because I need to carry many people. If there is an accident and the injury gets more serious because there was no air bag, how is Toyota going to respond?�� he said.Toyota took the step of disabling passenger-side air bags after consulting with Japan’s transport ministry, which approved the action. The automaker has told regulators it expects to have replacement parts available around September.“We temporarily suspended the air bag function on vehicles in Japan until the parts are available because (the ministry) requires a remedy at the time of recall filing,�� Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said. “We considered the lead time of remedy parts preparation, and we prioritized the customer’s safety.��	1.885343798
LONDON (Reuters) - British car output fell for the tenth month in a row in March, hit by a slowdown in key foreign markets, and the sector stands to suffer a lot more if the country leaves the European Union without a deal, an industry body said on Tuesday.Output tumbled by an annual 14.4 percent to 126,195 cars in March, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.Exports, which account for nearly four out of every five cars made in Britain, were down by 13.4 percent.The SMMT said analysis it had commissioned predicted output would fall this year to 1.36 million units from 1.52 million in 2018, assuming London can secure a transition deal with the EU.If Britain has to rely instead on World Trade Organization rules for its trade with the bloc, which include import tariffs, output is forecast to fall by around 30 percent to 1.07 million units in 2021, returning to mid-1980s levels, the SMMT said.The forecasts were produced for SMMT by AutoAnalysis, a consultancy.Prime Minister Theresa May has secured a delay to the Brexit deadline until Oct. 31, giving her more time to try to break an impasse in parliament over the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU.Foreign minister Jeremy Hunt traveled to Japan earlier this month to try to persuade the Japanese government and Toyota, which has a big presence in Britain, that London was determined to avoid a no-deal Brexit.“Just a few years ago, industry was on track to produce 2 million cars by 2020 - a target now impossible with Britain’s reputation as stable and attractive business environment undermined,�� SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said.“All parties must find a compromise urgently so we can set about repairing the damage and diverting energy and investment to the technological challenges that will define the future of the global industry.��	-3.114886731
* GS Yuasa says targeting double-range battery around 2020* Shares rise 10 pct* Electric cars seen taking off in Europe, China (Recasts with company, market comments, background on EV market)TOKYO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Japan’s GS Yuasa Corp surged 10 percent on Tuesday after the Nikkei business daily reported the company would begin mass-producing a new lithium-ion battery that would double the range of electric cars as early as in 2020.Electric vehicles have gotten a boost as a greener alternative to conventional cars as European governments move to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars over the next few decades. China has already touted EVs as its choice for zero-emission cars, forcing global automakers to embrace the technology.But limited driving range, long charging times, and the high cost of batteries are major hurdles preventing electric cars from becoming mainstream today.GS Yuasa has said it was working on a lithium-ion battery that would double the range of its current battery at similar prices, targeting production around 2020. But a spokeswoman said the company was not ready to announce anything final, including where it would produce the batteries or which automakers it would supply.“In addition to domestic automakers, we would hope to supply European ones as electric vehicles are expected to take off there,�� she said.GS Yuasa’s stock jumped as much as 15 percent before paring gains to 10 percent, giving it a market value of 235 billion yen ($2.1 billion). The broader Tokyo market was down slightly.“Anything related to electric vehicles is of strong interest to investors now,�� said Yoshihiro Okumura, general manager at Chibagin Asset Management.“As companies prepare for the shift (towards EVs in Europe), investors are also looking to spot the right stocks. They don’t want to fall behind.”The Nikkei said Lithium Energy Japan - GS Yuasa’s joint venture with Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsubishi Motors Corp - would produce the batteries at its factory in Shiga prefecture, western Japan.GS Yuasa’s domestic rivals such as Panasonic Corp, which supplies to Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla Inc , are also racing to develop next-generation batteries.Toyota said last month it was developing an all-solid-state battery that would significantly boost the driving range and reduce charging times, aiming for commercialisation in the early 2020s.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Thai unit has launched a voluntary redundancy program aimed at cutting around 800 subcontractors in Thailand due to economic problems in the southeast Asian country and abroad.Thailand’s economic slowdown, along with uncertainty over the global economy, have affected both the domestic automotive industry and exports since the beginning of the year, it said in a statement.That has caused a reduction in production volume, overtime hours and monthly income offered to employees, it said.The company has offered the redundancy package to around 800 subcontractors but more workers have applied for the scheme, Phuphal Samata, the president of Toyota Thailand Worker’s Union, told Reuters.“There isn’t overtime payment anymore, so many subcontractors may want to find other work and take this compensation package,�� he said.Toyota commands about a third of the local auto market and has 18,000 workers in Thailand, 40 percent of whom are subcontractors, he said.Thailand is a regional production and export hub for the world’s top carmakers. The sector accounts for around 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.Domestic auto sales have declined almost every month on a yearly basis since May 2013 following the ending of a government car subsidy scheme in 2012.In January, Toyota forecast Thailand’s total domestic car sales would fall 10 percent in 2016 from a year ago to 720,000 units. It sees its own annual auto sales falling 9.8 percent from last year.Job cuts at Toyota are unlikely to spread to other automakers as the firm has hired many workers since the car subsidy scheme, said Surapong Paisitpattanapong, spokesman for the Federation of Thai Industries�� Auto Industry.“I don’t think others will immediately follow suit because May’s auto production, exports and domestic auto sales are growing. There’s still hope,�� he said.	16.72134407
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales inched just 0.2 percent higher in March from a year earlier, figures on Tuesday showed, but an independent auto industry analyst said the modest increase masked a solid performance during severe winter weather, especially in comparison with the record sales of March 2013.Canadian sales rose to 157,060 vehicles in March from 156,680 the year before, marking the second-best March on record, said Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.“Being up by a sliver isn’t shooting the lights out, but when put in the context of a never-ending winter and strong year-ago sales, then current sales levels should be applauded rather than scorned,�� he wrote in a report.Truck sales climbed 5.1 percent to 90,851 vehicles from 86,475 last year, while car sales went in the opposite direction, falling 5.7 percent to 66,209 vehicles, the DesRosiers report said.“Perhaps the biggest ongoing dynamic is the strength in the light truck market,�� he wrote.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish automotive production rose 20 percent year on year to 869,158 vehicles in the first half, with output up 8 percent to 141,161 vehicles in June, Turkey’s automotive producers body said.Domestic automotive sales, including both cars, light and heavy commercial vehicles fell 9 percent to 410,609 units in the first half as last year’s tax increases and forex induced price increases continued to put pressure on markets.Turkey’s automotive exports climbed 29 percent to 714,284 units, led by a 48 percent rise in car exports as manufacturers continued to ramp up the output of export oriented models.Turkey’s Automotive Industry Association also upped its year-end production forecast to 1.7 million vehicles from 1.65 million.Year-end automotive exports, the biggest contributor to national exports, were seen at 1.4 million units, with an approximate value of 28 billion dollars the industry association said.Global manufacturers such as Toyota, Hyundai, Ford and Fiat Chrysler operate their plants in Turkey as export hubs, with only part of the production sold in the local market.	4.509332841
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co 7203.T is betting that its redesigned ES 350 sedan will buoy sales of its Lexus brand, which lost its place last year as the top-selling luxury nameplate in the United States.The 2013 Lexus ES 350 and its hybrid version, the 300h, will go on sale in mid-August. Lexus expects sales of both models will reach about 5,000 a month, Tim Morrison, vice president for sales and dealer development said in Dearborn on Wednesday.As a brand, Lexus is aiming to sell 250,000 vehicles in the United States this year, up 25 percent from 200,000 last year. The ES 350 is Lexus�� top-selling car.Lexus saw its 11-year streak as the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. market end last year, due in part to vehicle shortages after the Japanese earthquake last year. But analysts say the Lexus lineup also suffered because it lost some of its luster.Lexus is hoping to draw younger buyers with its new sportier design, including a “spindle�� grill that narrows in the middle, that the company has described as “the new face of Lexus.�� Executives said Lexus models launched earlier this year, such as the Lexus GS 350, have gained traction.“We needed new product and we’re getting it now,�� Morrison said. “Everything we’ve launched seems to be working well, knock on wood.”In 2011, BMW AG BMWG.DE won the luxury sales crown followed by Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz and then Lexus.In the first five months of 2012, Lexus sales were up 14 percent to just over 88,000. It trails Mercedes-Benz and BMW respectively. Mercedes sold 113,520 cars through May 2012, up 19 percent. BMW sales were up 14 percent to 104,779.	0.2630540576
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly operating profit, shrugging off a firm yen and the damaging impact of flooding in Thailand, and raised its annual forecast, helped by cost cuts and Japanese government subsidies.“They lifted their pretax profit forecast for the year to March 2012 to 270 billion yen from 170 billion yen, and this can probably be taken as a straightforward positive (for its shares).“It gives a positive impression, with electronics and other sectors issuing downward revisions.“As for a rebound for the stock to 3,000 yen from tomorrow onwards, these results could get the job done.“In terms of their currency rate forecasts, their euro/yen outlook looks a bit rosy, so this leaves some cause for worry.”FUMIYUKI NAKANISHI, GENERAL MANAGER OF INVESTMENT AND RESEARCH, SMBC FRIEND SECURITIES, TOKYO“It is a surprising, good number. I think most in the market were expecting much worse. The operating profit forecast for the year to March is nearly halved from the previous year but that doesn’t mean it’s going to fall into a loss, and that sets them apart from other Japanese corporations.“But just looking at the fourth quarter, it doesn’t look like the recovery is going to be as robust as expected and there are a lot of downside risks, especially considering Europe. But there is a sense of positive surprise at their results. I think we are going to see cost-cutting benefits from Toyota’s negotiations for lower material prices with Nippon Steel and probably other firms.”�It (the impression of the results) is really weak. They have revised the operating profit upwards by 70 billion yen, but that still remains very low... They will sell 2.4 million cars in the fourth quarter and only be able to make 50 billion yen in operating profit. This means their automobile business is in a really tough situation.“Compared with Honda and Nissan, Toyota’s pace of profits returning is very slow. The profit performance of their automobile business is abnormally low. The issue of high fundamental costs appears not to have improved at all.“In terms of costs, they can work on cutting fixed costs... Their production capacity, number of employees, number of parts makers, number of dealers, vehicle lines, they have too much of everything... Compared to the pace of the sales drop, their cost-cutting is not progressing at all. The cost cut effects have yet to show up in the figures.“The other issue is the top line, which is struggling to grow... Even if the number of cars they can sell increases, profits won’t grow so much.“The share price has been rising ahead of the next business year when profits are likely to grow quite a bit and the PER has returned to 1. But the PER is unlikely to go up from here... Honda and Nissan are better off at this stage.”�Analysts�� consensus on operating profit was 300 billion yen so it (Toyota’s new forecast) was slightly weaker, but this is not so important. More important is if Toyota can recover in the next fiscal year.“The outlook is not so positive as I fear the economic recovery will not be as strong as analysts expect, which will drag on Toyota’s performance, but this is not specific to Toyota.“Today’s result will not have a major impact on Toyota’s share price.”TOSHIYUKI KANAYAMA, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, MONEX SECURITIES, TOKYO“The operating profit forecast was below consensus so it is a bit of a disappointment. But that was partly due to the floods in Thailand and the market is looking at the next financial year, rather than this year.“According to my back-of-the-envelope calculations, its fourth-quarter operating profit is around 150 billion yen. The key for Toyota shares will be whether profit will rise to around 200 billion yen per quarter or around 800 billion yen in the year.“I don’t think they can easily drop their target of domestic production of 3 million units.“The important point for now is whether they can generate profits that match market expectations in the next financial year.��	3.655319683
* Q1 profit up about 27 pct* Q1 total vehicle sales up 24.3 pct Y-o-Y* Shares down 3.6 pct (Adds details and share movement)July 26 (Reuters) - India’s largest selling car maker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, posted a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, as forex losses and increased costs of raw materials partially offset higher sales of compact and utility vehicles.The company, majority-owned by Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp , reported profit of 19.75 billion rupees ($287.38 million) for the quarter ended June 30, versus 15.56 billion a year earlier.That compared with an average estimate of 22.71 billion rupees by 18 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue from operations rose 13.6 percent to 224.59 billion rupees, the company said.Maruti’s operations are key for Suzuki as it provides the bulk of the Japanese automaker’s revenues, and has a market value of more than $43 billion, around 1-1/2 times that of its parent.Maruti sold 490,479 vehicles during the quarter, up 24.3 percent from a year earlier. Sales of compact vehicles, which include the Swift and Baleno, rose 49.8 percent, while sales of utility vehicles, including the Ertiga and Vitara Brezza, climbed 15.1 percent.Suzuki this year announced an agreement with Toyota Motor Corp for the Indian market, by which Suzuki will supply its Baleno hatchback and Vitara Brezza to Toyota, while Toyota will produce the Corolla sedan for Suzuki.Shares of the New Delhi-based car maker were down 3.6 percent.

* Honda, Mazda target around 10 pct sales rise in 2015* Overall sales down 18 pct in H1* Consumers delaying purchases as economy deteriorates (Updates auto sales data to H1)JAKARTA, July 14 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are sticking to their targets in Indonesia in defiance of the longest sales decline in six years, resorting to steep discounts to entice tight-spending consumers into showrooms that remain stubbornly empty.Honda Motor Co Ltd, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Mazda Motor Corp aim to sell more cars this year than last, though overall sales to distributors have fallen each month since September and are down 18 percent in 2015.“The decline is pretty drastic,�� said dealership salesman Jonatan, whose monthly average sales of Toyota Motor Corp cars was four versus eight last year. “We certainly have to work extra hard to sell cars these days.”Auto sales are a key indicator of consumption in Indonesia, where the economy is growing at its slowest since 2009, and where 7 percent inflation is eroding purchasing power. Consumers are consequently reserving more money for primary needs, the central bank said last month.In response, automotive industry association Gaikindo in June lowered its sales forecast for this year to a range of 1 million to 1.1 million vehicles from 1.2 million.“We are struggling with the market slowdown,�� said PT Honda Prospect Motor director Jonfis Fandy.The firm has been trying to boost sales since early in the year via promotions usually reserved for Indonesia’s annual automotive exhibition in August, to meet Honda’s target sales increase of 10 percent.Promotions include discounts on down payments, low-interest loans, and extending instalment periods to seven years from around four. Honda has sold 1.4 percent more cars as of end-May.At Mazda, which aims to sell 9 percent more cars, one customer said he was offered 11 percent off a 450 million rupiah ($33,860.05) sports utility vehicle. But the mid-30s communication manager still delayed purchase for six months as economic conditions made him worry about finances.Astrid Ariani Wijaya, senior marketing manager at PT Mazda Motor Indonesia - for whom year-to-date sales figures are unavailable - said the slowdown is affecting all industries, not just auto.“What we are doing is maintaining advertising consistency in mass media,�� she said. “Discounts would depend on the model, and each dealer has different stocks.”Inflation and a weak rupiah are keeping the benchmark interest rate high at 7.5 percent, so the central bank is trying to boost demand by easing the passenger car down payment requirement to 25 percent from 30 percent.“Willingness to spend money on big purchases is not there,�� said BNI Securities analyst Thendra Crisnanda. “So I doubt the down payment easing will be a significant help.”Auto demand usually peaks before Indonesia’s Lebaran holiday in mid-July as consumers buy cars to visit home towns, but this year it is far less than expected, Crisnanda said.At Toyota, one dealership salesman said supplies had fallen for its most popular multi-purpose vehicle, the Avanza.Rahmat Samulo, a director at PT Toyota Astra Motor, said the company is making supply-demand adjustments and that, “if the stock is enough, we are not going to add excessively.”Toyota has sold 25 percent fewer cars as of end-May. It declined to disclose its 2015 target, but said it aims to maintain its market share of around 33 percent.Japan’s top automaker opened its second local plant in 2013, will open an engine factory next year, and plans to invest further in the country. Despite the slowdown, investment plans are “still on track��, an official at PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia told Reuters.At Nissan, where sales are down 22 percent, its two local factories are running at 40 percent capacity, and have inventory turnover of about two months versus less than one month “during good days��, Trimegah Securities said in a June report.PT Nissan Motor Indonesia president director Steve Ardianto did not comment on production. But he said the firm is offering variants of current models, adding dealerships and improving service to lift its 2015 share to 6 percent from 4.7 percent.

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T could sacrifice its global market share goal to reach its mid-term profitability target after slower-than-expected sales in its biggest markets left its profit margin the tightest among Japanese car makers.Nissan’s six-year plan ending 2017, in which it aims to boost its market share to 8 percent from 6 percent, has been shaken by a Sino-Japanese diplomatic dispute knocking sales in China, and manufacturing difficulties hitting U.S. product launches.Japan's second-largest carmaker by global sales volume after Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T also aims for operating profit equivalent to 8 percent of revenue by March 2017 through scaling back buying incentives in the United States and cutting costs with alliance partner Renault SA RENA.PA.Nissan, on reporting an 18.4 percent rise in April-December net profit on Monday, said its nine-month operating margin was 4.1 percent, down from 4.5 percent a year earlier. That compared with 6.6 percent at Honda Motor Co 7267.T and 9.7 percent at Toyota.“If we can meet our 8 percent profitability target, then it is fine if the share is a little lower and the company is moving to emphasize profitability,�� Corporate Vice President Joji Tagawa told reporters after Nissan released earnings.Nissan reported nine-month net profit of 274.1 billion yen ($2.68 billion). For October-December, profit rose 56.8 percent to 84.3 billion yen compared with a 57.1 billion yen mean estimate of seven analysts in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll.The quarterly net profit growth was the steepest in almost two years as a weaker yen allowed Nissan to convert money made overseas at a more favorable exchange rate, and as sales improved in China where some consumers boycotted Japanese goods following a territorial row in September 2012.Shares of Nissan ended Monday 0.1 percent higher before the earnings release compared with a 1.8 percent rise in the benchmark index .N225.The maker of Infiniti and Datsun brands left its profit outlook for the full year ending March at 355 billion yen, or 4.1 percent more than the year prior, compared with analysts�� 364.2 billion yen estimate.Nissan cut the outlook three months ago by nearly 20 percent, citing heavy investment in new plants and product recall-related costs.“We expect to see a significant improvement in our financial performance in the last three months of our fiscal year,�� Tagawa said, adding that he expects steady sales in Japan, China and the United States.Nissan offers more incentives to buy its cars in the United States than its Japanese and South Korean rivals, squeezing profit margins.In October-December, Nissan's incentives knocked an average $2,562 from each vehicle's retail price compared with $1,952 for Toyota, $1,799 for Honda and $1,759 for Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and affiliate Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS, according to industry researcher Autodata.In January, Nissan’s U.S. sales rose 12 percent on year to 90,470 vehicles, helped by strong sales of the redesigned Rogue crossover sport utility vehicle.Based on accounting standards in place when setting mid-term targets, Nissan on Monday said April-December operating profit margin would have been 4.7 percent, and that it would assess the targets on the basis of the previous standards.($1 = 102.2150 Japanese yen)	-6.530404546

WASHINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - A group of major automakers accounting for more than half of U.S. auto sales will make automatic emergency braking standard on new U.S. vehicles in one of the nation’s biggest auto safety announcements since the introduction of standard airbags in the late 1980s.The car makers, which accounted for 57 percent of car and light truck sales in the United States last year, will work out an implementation plan in coming months with auto safety regulators and experts, the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) said in a statement on Friday.The makers are Volkswagen and its luxury car division Audi, BMW, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, Mazda Motor Corp, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Tesla Motors Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and Volvo AB.“We are entering a new era of vehicle safety, focused on preventing crashes from ever occurring, rather than just protecting occupants when crashes begin,�� U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in the IIHS statement.“But if technologies such as automatic emergency braking are only available as options, or on the most expensive models, too few Americans will see the benefits,�� he added.The agreement echoes earlier moves by big automakers. In the late 1980s, Chrysler began installing airbags in all its vehicles. In the 2000s, GM, Ford and others agreed to make anti-rollover technology standard on most sport utility vehicles in response to mounting deaths from rollover accidents in such vehicles. Stability control is now mandatory on light vehicles.Automatic emergency breaking, or AEB, is widely recognized as a life-saving technology that uses radar, cameras and lasers to monitor road conditions and an apply brakes autonomously to avoid collisions.But analysts say it could take several years for automakers to redesign the electrical and braking systems of their cars to install autonomous braking. Among the automotive technology suppliers that could benefit from widespread adoption of autonomous braking are Continental AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, Delphi Automotive Plc, Denso Corp and Autoliv Inc.The technology is currently available as an option in only about 4 percent of cars in North America, according to the business information firm IHS Inc. Several automakers previously signaled plans to offer autonomous braking on more vehicles. Toyota said earlier this year said that by the end of 2017 it would offer such systems in option packages for nearly all its models, with the technology packages ranging from $300 to about $500 in price.Federal officials say AEB can help avoid rear-end collisions, which accounted for one-third of all police-reported car crashes in 2013. Studies, including a recent IIHS report, also show that AEB technology can reduce insurance injury claims by as much as 35 percent.IIHS and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will set performance criteria for manufacturers and determine how soon car buyers can expect to see AEB technology as standard equipment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T raised its forecast for full-year operating profit by 6% on Friday as a weaker yen increased the value of its overseas sales.Japan’s third-biggest automaker has been struggling to shore up its automobile operations, with profitability down more than half in the past two years due to a series of quality-related issues.And like other global automakers, Honda has been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak on vehicle production in China.The automaker plans to restart its factories in Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, on Feb. 14, Executive Vice President Seiji Kuraishi said at a briefing in Tokyo, after extending the Lunar New Year holiday in line with local government directives.There are no disruptions in China-made parts supplies that would prevent a restart of the three plants it operates in Wuhan with local joint venture partner Dongfeng Motor Group 0489.HK or production at other facilities globally, he said.Fiat Chrysler on Thursday said one of its European plants could close within two to four weeks if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work soon. Hyundai suspended production at its South Korean plants due to a shortage of China-made parts.The Nikkei newspaper reported last month that Honda parts supplier F-Tech is temporarily moving production of brake pedals from Wuhan to the Philippines.Among domestic rivals, Toyota said on Friday it would extend Chinese factory suspensions until at least Feb. 16, while Suzuki said it was looking into the possibility of procuring “made in China�� car parts from outside Wuhan.Honda raised its operating income forecast to 730 billion yen ($6.6 billion) for the year to March 31 from a previous estimate of 690 billion yen.It adjusted its expectation for the yen to average 108 to the dollar for the 12-month period from a prior forecast of 107.A weaker currency buoys profit because exports become less expensive and the value of overseas earnings increases.A 730 billion yen operating profit would narrowly top the previous year’s result, whereas the prior forecast of 690 billion yen would have been a four-year low.Honda raised its estimate slightly for global group auto sales in the current fiscal year by 5,000 units to 4,980,000 vehicles.For an interactive graphic on Honda's operating profit and vehicle sales, click on tmsnrt.rs/2p2j3AoThe company posted operating income of 166.6 billion yen for the October-December period, compared with 170.1 billion yen a year ago and an average forecast of 149.5 billion yen from nine analysts surveyed, according to Refinitiv.	-13.73471969
GUARENAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Since President Nicolas Maduro founded the Special Action Force of Venezuela’s National Police two-and-a-half years ago, the squad has earned a fearsome reputation in poor neighborhoods across Venezuela.Officers in the force have been accused of torture and summary executions by human rights groups, opposition politicians and ordinary citizens.Last November, Reuters published an investigation into 20 killings by the force, known as the FAES, in which the official narratives of shootings as acts of self-defense were countered by eyewitness accounts, video evidence, death certificates, autopsy reports and other documentation.The force has been linked to hundreds of deaths since its creation in 2017.For all its notoriety, though, the FAES is highly secretive, known for signature dark masks and black uniforms bearing skull insignias but no name tags. Officers typically remain anonymous even after blood is shed.Now, a court case involving the deaths of two men killed last March by the FAES reveals another little-known fact that Reuters is the first to publicly disclose: Some of the squad’s officers are convicted criminals.According to hundreds of sealed documents submitted by prosecutors in the case, at least two officers accused of involvement in the killings served prison terms before they joined the FAES.The documents �� which include autopsies, ballistic reports, officer testimony and personnel files �� also show that at least three other members of the same FAES precinct who aren’t being prosecuted over the deadly operation have criminal records of their own.It is both illegal and against national police policy for criminals to belong to the FAES. A 2009 law bars Venezuelans with criminal convictions from working as police officers. FAES guidelines and recruitment documents, reviewed by Reuters, say officers should have no criminal record and be of “good moral character.”Jose Dominguez, national commissioner of the FAES, in a brief exchange by text message told Reuters that members of the force go through “select processes�� and “special training.�� He didn’t respond to questions about the criminal records of some FAES officers or a request to discuss Reuters�� findings in person or by telephone.Venezuela’s Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, and the Information Ministry, responsible for government communications, didn’t return calls and emails by Reuters detailing its findings.The presence of convicts within the ranks of the FAES sheds new light on a security force widely considered by Venezuelans to be a mechanism of social control for Maduro, whose government is beleaguered by economic decline, widespread hunger and insecurity, and international sanctions and isolation.Hailed by the president as a new means to fight surging crime and violence, the FAES has become as feared as the criminals it was meant to target, especially in poor districts where hardship fans political instability.People familiar with the FAES say its leaders are more concerned with projecting force and fear than with rectitude.“They hire people who aren’t afraid to commit crimes, to enter a home without a warrant and kill,�� said Nora Echavez, a former chief prosecutor in Miranda, the state where the homicide court case will be heard. “A criminal does these things easily because they’ve already done them before.”Reuters couldn’t determine how many ex-convicts are working within FAES ranks nationwide. Personnel records aren’t disclosed by the government. Even the size of the FAES, estimated by fellow police officials to number about 1,500 officers, is held close by the administration.The mystery surrounding the force is part of its playbook, professionals familiar with it say. “The FAES prefer the anonymity,�� said Javier Gorrino, a criminologist and municipal police commissioner in El Hatillo, a district of Caracas, who has interacted with the force. “A mask causes more terror when you don’t know who’s behind it.”The case in Guarenas, a gritty commuter city 39 kilometers from Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, is one of few instances in which the identity and backgrounds of FAES officers has come to light.The two men killed there had law-enforcement backgrounds themselves. One was a municipal policeman from Caracas and the other was a former member of the same local force in the capital. Neither was affiliated with the FAES or any of its officers.The victims�� ties to law enforcement, people familiar with the case say, are likely the only reason that their deaths have prompted further investigation. The cases of thousands of other Venezuelans who have died at the hands of police, allegedly after resisting arrest, routinely go unexamined.Alexis Lira, a onetime policeman turned lawyer whose brother was one of the victims in Guarenas, says most families of people killed by cops lack resources and wherewithal to challenge the FAES�� accounts of its operations.“Most people just have to accept it,�� said Lira, who says he now spends much of his days working with prosecutors to seek accountability for his brother’s death. “I don’t.”His brother was Fernando Lira, a 39-year-old former policeman who had become a graphic designer. Also killed was Lira’s friend, Eligio Duarte, a 41-year-old municipal officer in Caracas. Neither man had a criminal record.They died March 6, 2019, when a group of FAES officers shot them after a brief car chase. In a statement to police investigators, the FAES supervisor who ran the operation said the men had fired upon his officers first. The police response was “proportionate,�� the supervisor said in his statement.Soon, evidence emerged to the contrary.Forensic tests showed that neither Lira nor Duarte, who had gone to Guarenas to collect money owed to Lira’s longtime girlfriend, fired a weapon at all. Both men were shot from above, according to autopsy reports, undermining the FAES claim that they were hit in a shootout.In a court filing that led to charges of homicide against the FAES supervisor and six officers, a state prosecutor wrote: “The events did not happen in the way the police officers claimed.”�NO PLACE ON ANY POLICE FORCE”Guarenas is the kind of violent place that could have benefited from a new national crime-fighting force. A community of about 200,000 people in Miranda state, east of the capital, it has crime rates that historically have exceeded the average for Venezuela.Some gangs, chased out of Caracas in recent years, have moved into hills that surround Guarenas and stretch along the nearby Caribbean coast. Police forces here and elsewhere in Miranda have long been considered corrupt.After oil prices plunged in 2014, sending Venezuela into recession, Maduro pursued economic policies that deepened the country’s woes. Nearly 5 million people have migrated, about 15% of the country’s populace.Among the exodus were soldiers, police officers and other public security workers. With wages equal to just a few dollars a month in Venezuela’s hyperinflationary economy, few incentives remained to attract qualified candidates to replace them.In Miranda, police ranks thinned so quickly that police bosses began lowering standards for recruits, six former officers familiar with the area told Reuters.Some hires had criminal records. Area police earned even more of a reputation for bribery, extortion, kidnapping and other crimes with tactics like shaking down citizens for their personal belongings or stopping trucks and looting their cargo.“There were officers who should have had no place on any police force,�� said Luis Martinez, a retired senior police official who worked in the area.Crime soared. The homicide rate, rising across Venezuela, climbed particularly fast in Miranda.From 100 murders per 100,000 residents earlier in the decade, the rate in the state by 2017 had soared to 153, according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, a research group based in Caracas. The figure was the second-highest in Venezuela and about 30 times the rate at the time in the United States.When Maduro launched the FAES in July 2017, his government tasked local police administrators with recruiting officers for the new force. Priorities included loyalty to the ruling Socialist party and a willingness to use aggressive tactics in crime-ridden neighborhoods nationwide, more than a dozen people familiar with those efforts said.In April 2018, the National Police launched the area FAES unit, administered from Zamora, a nearby municipality. The force set up headquarters behind a local hospital, next to the morgue. A crudely drawn skull graces a whitewashed plaster wall by the entrance.A former Zamora police operations chief, Oliver Alvarez, took command. He built a unit of 120 officers, many of whom came from local and nearby forces, according to employment contracts for the squad reviewed by Reuters. Alvarez couldn’t be reached for comment.Among the new FAES officers was Richard Sanchez, one of those charged in the Guarenas shootings. Sanchez, now 34, was indicted in 2004 for robbery and assault, according to court records. Reuters couldn’t determine whether he was convicted of those charges.In 2014, he was convicted of robbery and served two-and-a-half years in prison, the court documents show. Reuters was unable to reach Sanchez.His attorney, Miguel Pena, also represents all but one of the six other officers charged in the shootings. Pena told Reuters the accused are detained at a FAES barracks in Caracas, but are still officially part of the force.He confirmed Sanchez’s prior conviction, but said his clients in this case acted in self-defense. “I’m not saying they’re angels,�� Pena told Reuters in an interview. “But there was a shootout and they were defending themselves.”Another recruit for the local FAES was Jose Oliveros, an officer who had risen through police ranks in Miranda despite a prior conviction as an accessory to murder. According to court records, Oliveros, now 37, had accompanied two other men when one of them shot a man to death after a 2009 altercation.After serving one year of a five-year prison sentence, Oliveros was named deputy director of a small police force near Guarenas in 2017, government documents announcing his appointment to the post show. He became chief of that precinct in 2018 and then chief of another last year, even after joining the ranks of the FAES.Oliveros, reached by telephone, said he would seek permission from superiors to speak with Reuters. He didn’t respond to further efforts to reach him. Julio Ortega, Oliveros�� attorney, declined to speak with Reuters for this story.“WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE!”The Guarenas shootings followed a failed foreign currency transaction, according to transcripts of testimony by those involved to prosecutors and police investigators. It isn’t clear why FAES officers got involved or why the episode turned violent.Early on March 2, Maria Gonzalez received a text message at the Caracas apartment she shared with Lira, the former police officer. The couple had been together for 10 years and ran a t-shirt printing business.The text offered a basic transaction that many Venezuelans pursue to keep their income from being eroded by hyperinflation. By converting their local currency into dollars, they preserve the long-term value of their earnings.Jhonathan Coraspe, a former colleague of Gonzalez from Guarenas, told Gonzalez a friend had $500 in U.S. currency he wanted to exchange for bolivars, Venezuela’s currency. In the texts, reviewed by Reuters and corroborated by Gonzalez in interviews, she accepted the transaction.That same day, she transferred 1.68 million bolivars, roughly the equivalent value to $500 dollars at the time, to an account Coraspe said belonged to the friend, Ruben Alarcon. Gonzalez then drove the half hour to Guarenas to collect the dollars.Reuters was unable to reach Coraspe. After the shootings, he testified to police investigators and prosecutors but has since gone into hiding, according to attorneys involved in the case. Alarcon, the friend, didn’t return phone calls or texts from Reuters to discuss the incident.In Guarenas, Alarcon didn’t appear at a pharmacy where Coraspe said he would meet Gonzalez to hand over the dollars. “I trusted you,�� she wrote Coraspe. “I feel truly terrible,�� Coraspe replied, and agreed to see her later.That evening, Coraspe drove to Gonzalez’s Caracas apartment.He promised to secure the $500.Lira, the former police officer, and Duarte, the municipal police officer and friend who would also be shot when the transaction unraveled, were at the apartment, according to testimony by Coraspe and Gonzalez.Coraspe told investigators the two men forced him to leave his car as collateral in case he never came up with the $500. Gonzalez said Coraspe volunteered the silver 1997 Honda Civic himself.Neither Duarte nor Lira had a criminal record, according to a document Caracas police sent to prosecutors for the case. Five former colleagues told Reuters both men had been upstanding citizens and policemen.On the morning of March 4, Coraspe called Hugo Martinez, a FAES officer he knew from his neighborhood, according to Coraspe’s testimony to prosecutors. He told Martinez that two men had stolen his car and were trying to extort $500 from him.A day later, Martinez told Coraspe to tell Gonzalez he had the $500 but no way to get to Caracas, Coraspe testified. Coraspe texted Gonzalez and said he could meet in Guarenas the following day.The next morning, March 6, Gonzalez sent Lira, who left with Duarte to retrieve the money, Gonzalez told investigators. In text messages, Coraspe testified, Lira agreed to meet him at a gas station.With Lira bound for Guarenas, Martinez called his FAES supervisor, Alexander Uzcategui, and told him about the alleged extortion, transcripts of testimony by Uzcategui show. Martinez told Uzcategui that Coraspe would soon meet the two men from Caracas at the gas station. The supervisor said they and a small group of FAES colleagues would “await�� them there.Reuters was unable to reach Martinez, Uzcategui or any of the other officers charged in the operation.At 1 p.m., Coraspe waited at the gas station. Lira and Duarte arrived in a blue Toyota Hilux pickup. Nearby, in two vehicles, FAES officers watched.According to Uzcategui’s testimony to police investigators, the men in the pickup pulled a gun and forced Coraspe into their vehicle “under the threat of death.�� They sped off, he said. His squad gave chase.Coraspe, in his own comments to investigators, said he entered the truck voluntarily. Neither Duarte nor Lira brandished a weapon, he said. Unprompted, FAES officers shot at the moving Toyota, he added.Frightened, Coraspe pulled the handbrake. The pickup crashed into the roadside. “We’re all going to die,�� Coraspe recalled telling the other men.According to the transcript of his testimony, Coraspe emerged from the crash, ran toward a FAES vehicle and got in. Officers, meanwhile, approached the pickup.Duarte and Lira, Coraspe testified, exited with their hands up. They followed FAES orders to lie down. With the men prone, Coraspe said, he could no longer see them.He heard gunshots.Five minutes later, FAES officers pulled Coraspe from their car and ordered him to lie on the ground, he testified. He saw Lira and Duarte “lying motionless,�� Coraspe told prosecutors.Uzcategui told investigators that Lira and Duarte had fired upon his squad. His officers fired back, shooting both. After the gunfight, he said, officers took the men to a hospital, where a doctor declared them dead.“WHAT REALLY HAPPENED”At 2.30 p.m., Marlon Brito, a detective with the Corps for Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation received an order from supervisors to go to the morgue, according to his written report for the case. The corps, known as the CICPC, conducts forensic work for the National Police.Reuters was unable to reach Brito for comment.At the morgue, next to the hospital, Brito saw two bodies.With a national identity card that had been on Duarte, Brito identified the Caracas officer’s corpse. Lira’s corpse would later be identified by the English words “FREEDOM�� and “History�� tattooed on his left forearm.Duarte suffered two bullet wounds to the chest, Brito wrote in his report. Lira had two chest wounds and a gunshot to the stomach. Autopsies confirmed the wounds Brito reported.From the morgue, Brito drove to the site of the crash and shootings. Uzcategui, the supervisor, stood guard with about 15 other FAES officers, according to Brito’s report.The Hilux was riddled with bullets, Brito wrote. Photos of the scene reviewed by Reuters also show the pierced pickup. Spent shells littered the area and two pistols lay on the ground.Officers told Brito the guns belonged to suspects who had fired upon them.Within days, autopsy and forensic reports contradicted the FAES account.Autopsy results, prepared by a separate government agency, on March 19 concluded that both men had been shot from above. The reports, reviewed by Reuters and also contained in the court documents, say bullets pierced Duarte “from above down.�� Lira was shot “from above downward.”Duarte Nuno Vieira, a professor of forensic medicine and medical law at the University of Coimbra, in Portugal, reviewed the autopsy results at Reuters�� request. “The autopsy reports,�� he said, “are more in line with a context of summary execution.”In its forensics report, the CICPC concluded that Lira and Duarte’s hands had no trace of antimony, barium or lead, telltale chemicals expelled by most guns.A forensics specialist in Spain, who reviewed the findings for Reuters, said the report was conclusive. “They didn’t fire a single shot,�� said Francisco Gallego, director of the Technical Institute of Ballistic Studies in Madrid.The CICPC report said that forensic evidence and testimony put the seven officers charged at the scene.Uzcategui, the supervisor, fired the 9 mm pistol rounds that killed Duarte, the report said. The specificity was possible because the bullets, traced by forensics to Uzcategui’s gun, remained in Duarte’s body, according to the autopsy.Although the rounds that killed Lira left through exit wounds, ballistics in the report indicated that three of the six other officers charged had fired weapons.Meyfer Diaz, a 23-year-old recruit who joined the force just two months before the shootings, fired a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun. A month before the operation, Diaz posted a Facebook photo of himself in FAES gear. “Suck it,�� he wrote, “nothing gets to me.”Sanchez, the officer who served prison time for robbery, fired his Tanfoglio pistol four times. Investigators traced fourteen other rounds at the scene to Oliveros, the officer who served time as an accomplice to murder.Ballistic reports and a FAES document contained in the prosecutors�� case file, both reviewed by Reuters, show the rounds came from a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 assigned to Oliveros. At a July hearing, Ortega, Oliveros�� lawyer, argued that his client didn’t have the gun on the day of the killings.In his testimony to prosecutors, Coraspe, whose phone call set off the episode, said FAES officers after the shootings told him to tell investigators “it was a confrontation.�� Instead, he said, “I told the officers what really happened.”The defendants are scheduled to appear in court in March; the trial is expected to take months. Attorneys leading the prosecution for the state didn’t respond to requests from Reuters to discuss the case.Alexis Lira, the graphic designer’s brother, visits the courthouse and prosecutors weekly to make sure the case is progressing.Gonzalez, Fernando Lira’s girlfriend and intended beneficiary of the missing $500, after Lira’s death gradually grew weaker from a longstanding struggle with pulmonary hypertension. Reuters interviewed her multiple times in late 2019.On January 3, Gonzalez died of heart failure.“She was our companion in this battle,�� said Jeanette Padron, a physician, friend and the longtime partner of Duarte, the other man killed. “Fernando’s death broke her down.��	-20.13514485
* Macron holds Versailles summit two days before Davos gathering* Toyota, Facebook, others announce new investments in France* Investments come as French firms lose global market sharePARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron sought on Monday to show that his activity on the world stage and his pro-business reforms were bearing fruit with a highly-publicised summit of global CEOs in Versailles and a flurry of investment announcements.A 300 million euro ($368 million) investment by Japanese carmaker Toyota to increase capacity at its northern French plant producing the Yaris model was set to be the centrepiece of the day, with 800 new jobs to be added by 2020.Smaller but “emblematic�� investment projects would also be unveiled, Macron’s office said, including new research centres by digital giants and new factories in the agrobusiness.Facebook, whose chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg was to meet Macron in Versailles, said on Monday it would double the number of staff at its Paris artificial intelligence hub.“Showcasing these projects will create a snowball effect,�� a presidential adviser said.Eight months into his presidency, Macron is keen to convince the French that the tax cuts he is providing to corporates and millionaires are not a giveaway to the rich but can yield higher investment and curb an unemployment rate of nearly 10 percent.Some 140 of the world’s most powerful business executives are expected at the gilded Palace of Versailles on Monday afternoon, where they will “speed date�� with French ministers and be joined by Macron in the evening.The summit dubbed “Choose France�� is held just two days before Macron heads to the global elite’s annual gathering at Davos, making sure the event catches the top executives on their way to the Swiss Alps.If the list of attendees - including Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein and Google’s Sundar Pichai - is a sign of the 40-year old leader’s pulling power, it is also a reminder of France’s more pressing need for foreign investment to reduce a trade deficit of almost 50 billion euros.In a study published last week, the COE-Rexecode think-tank said French companies had continued to lose market share to their euro zone rivals on global markets, with French goods and services accounting for 12.9 percent of the bloc’s exports last year, down from 13.2 percent in 2016 and 17 percent in 2000.In 2016, France was the 16th highest recipient of foreign direct investments in the world, UN data showed, with $28 billion, well below Europe’s top two inflow hosts, Britain and the Netherlands, with $254 billion and $92 billion respectively.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday that a planned sovereign wealth fund to finance infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy will raise at least $20 billion once established.Widodo discussed plans to establish the fund with Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed over the weekend during an official visit there.Sovereign wealth funds are typically used by countries to direct funds from resource wealth such as oil, although Indonesia also plans to invite foreign investment into its fund.“When the law presiding over this is issued, we’ll have a minimum $20 billion inflow,�� Widodo told a financial industry event in Jakarta.Widodo, who began his second term in office in October, is keen for an increase in foreign investment to help create jobs and boost economic growth, which has been stuck at around 5% for several years.Discussions with the crown prince had included using the sovereign wealth fund to channel investment into the development of Indonesia’s new capital city on Borneo island, according to Indonesia’s Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan.In an interview with Reuters on Jan. 8, Pandjaitan said the crown prince had agreed in principle to put money into the fund but needed Indonesia to pass a law to ensure legal certainty and then Jakarta would also put in cash and “brownfield�� assets.“When it’s been established, anybody can join,�� said Pandjaitan, adding that the fund would be like an equity fund.The minister said tech conglomerate Softbank Group Corp 9984.T and newly established development financier the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) had also expressed interest in investing. With low-lying Jakarta on Java island facing a range of pressures from congestion to flooding and pollution, President Widodo announced last August a plan to relocate government departments to a site in East Kalimantan on Borneo island.To help attract investment, Indonesia has asked Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Masayoshi Son, the founder of Softbank, to join a steering committee advising on the $33 billion plan to move the capital, ministers have said.“Their role on the steering board is to oversee the development of the new capital,�� Indonesia’s chief economic affairs minister Airlangga Hartarto told Reuters on Wednesday.Planning minister Suharso Monoarfa said that Softbank was interested in providing self-driving vehicles for the capital.In June, the self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank and Toyota Motor 7203.T announced plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia this year.A representatives for Softbank did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokeswoman for former prime minister Blair declined to comment.	-0.471293916

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan automaking alliance emerged as the world’s biggest seller of light vehicles in 2017, bumping Volkswagen AG off the top spot, after the inclusion of Mitsubishi Motors�� numbers boosted its final tally.Nissan Motor Co’s sales hit a record high of 5.82 million, while French automaker Renault SA has reported sales of 3.76 million. Mitsubishi’s sales came in at 1.03 million, bringing total 2017 sales for the group to around 10.61 million light vehicles.Together, the three automakers beat record sales of around 10.53 million light vehicles at Volkswagen, 2016’s top seller which also includes the Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands.Toyota Motor Corp, which held the No.2 spot in 2016, posted group sales of 10.2 million units last year, excluding its Hino Motors heavy trucks.Many automakers are trying to boost sales volumes to achieve economies of scale and cut costs amid soaring investments needed to develop next-generation automotive technologies - including self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services.This has been a focus of the Renault-Nissan group, and was a key motivation for Nissan when it acquired a controlling stake in smaller rival Mitsubishi Motors in 2016.Renault-Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has pledged to make scale an advantage and use it to double savings to 10 billion euros ($12 billion) by 2022, based on a rise in annual sales volumes to 14 million units.Renault, Nissan and some other automakers are looking to share more vehicle parts and consolidate production platforms to trim R&amp;D and manufacturing costs and raise profitability.Toyota is taking a similar approach, while it is also partnering with Mazda Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp to reign in the costs of developing and marketing electric cars and other new technologies.But not all automakers consider scale as a way to increased efficiency and profitability.General Motors Co has concluded that size does not matter as much, selling its struggling European operation Opel to PSA last year to focus capital on more profitable ventures.The strategy seems to have worked for the U.S. automaker, which posted a profit margin of 6.8 percent in January-September. That was higher than a 5.0 percent margin at Nissan and 4.3 percent at Mitsubishi Motors in the six months through October, and a 4.8 percent margin at Renault over January-June.Earlier this month, GM pointed to new trucks and SUVs, a new, low-cost car for international markets, and the Cadillac luxury brand as possible future earnings drivers.	-6.610800745
* Nikkei gains 2.2% for the week, up for fifth straight week* Exporters mixed, market in a holding pattern pre-U.S. jobs dataTOKYO, July 5 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei edged higher in choppy trade on Friday as investors kept to the sidelines before the release of a key U.S. jobs report, while oil and mining shares underperformed after oil prices fell on global growth concerns.The Nikkei share average ended 0.2% higher to 21,746.38, after trading in and out of the red. For the week, the index rose 2.2% for its fifth consecutive weekly gains after a Sino-U.S. trade truce sparked hopes the two warring sides could make progress in long-drawn out negotiations.With U.S. markets closed for a national holiday on Thursday, trading remained thin.Investors are waiting on the U.S. jobs report due out later in the day, which could determine if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later this month or delays such a move to its next meeting.The ADP National Employment Report, which comes ahead of the more comprehensive monthly nonfarm payrolls data, showed U.S. private employers added 102,000 jobs in June, well below economists�� expectations.“Since the ADP number was bad, the market expects the jobs report to be sour, but investors would rather wait till next week to trade as jobs data can provide surprises at times,�� said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.Exporters were mixed, with Advantest Corp rising 1.8%, Panasonic Corp falling 0.5% and Toyota Motor Corp was up 0.3%.Mining and oil shares lost ground after crude oil prices fell on concerns over the outlook for global economic growth.Inpex Corp dropped 1.4% and Idemitsu Kosan shed 0.3%.The broader Topix gained 0.2% to 1,592.58.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday a CNN report linking an internal engineering memo to potential glitches that could cause sudden unintended acceleration in its cars was ""grossly inaccurate"".CNN said on its website Toyota engineers had found an electronic software problem that caused sudden unintended acceleration in a test vehicle during pre-production trials, citing an internal engineering report, in Japanese, that it had obtained and translated.A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo repeated the company’s explanation on CNN that the broadcaster’s translations were wrong, noting the term “unintended sudden acceleration�� appeared nowhere in the Japanese document. He added that the document concerned a fail-safing test for adaptive cruise control on a prototype vehicle that had nothing to do with sudden acceleration.The U.S. government in early 2011 cleared Toyota’s electronics of causing unintended acceleration, ending an extensive probe conducted by engineers both at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and NASA.“In the face of overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary, CNN has irresponsibly aired a grossly inaccurate segment on Anderson Cooper 360 that attempts to resurrect the discredited, scientifically unproven allegation that there is a hidden defect in Toyota’s electronic throttle control system that can cause unintended acceleration,�� Toyota said in a statement.CNN interviewed one independent safety expert and a mechanical engineer in the Anderson Cooper news show, both of whose interpretations were based on CNN’s translations.Toyota recalled millions of vehicles in the United States to fix potential problems of unintended acceleration, focusing on mechanical issues with “sticky�� accelerator pedals and the risk that floormats could trap the pedal in the open position. U.S. investigators concluded that most reports of runaway acceleration could be explained by driver error.Links of letters sent to Turner Broadcasting System from Toyota, as well as the original document and translations provided by CNN, can be seen on its website.here"	6.708517971
TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - The head of Toyota Motor Corp’s electric vehicle (EV) business told Reuters the automaker has received enquiries from more than 50 companies since announcing last week that it would offer free access to patents for EV motors and power control units.The executive also said Toyota aims to use partnerships to cut by as much as half the outlays for expanded electric and hybrid vehicle components production in the United States, China and Japan.“Until now we have been a tier 1 automaker, but now we also intend to become a tier 2 supplier of hybrid systems,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi said.Supplying rivals would greatly expand the scale of production for hardware such as power control units and electric motors that are used in gasoline-electric hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fully electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles, he added.Toyota last week outlined plans to offer automakers and auto suppliers royalty-free access to nearly 24,000 electrified vehicle technologies patented by the Japanese auto giant.In an interview on Thursday at Toyota’s global headquarters in Toyota City, Japan, Terashi provided new details of Toyota’s strategy, and its anticipated impact on the company’s investment plans.By offering to supply rival automakers with parts used in Toyota’s gasoline-sipping hybrid vehicles, the Japanese automaker sees a way to slash capital outlay by roughly half for new plants required to build electric car components for future models, Terashi said.“We believe that this approach will reduce investment costs significantly,�� he said.Terashi said Toyota projects a surge in demand for electrified vehicles globally as regulators insist new vehicles emit substantially less carbon dioxide, and that working with Toyota would offer others a low-cost path to compliance.Toyota’s internal goal is to sell 5.5 million electrified, Toyota-brand vehicles annually by 2030, up from about 1.6 million vehicles now, he said.Already, Terashi said, Toyota believes it could reach the 5.5 million target as early as 2025. The company is working on plans for a new round of capital spending to expand capacity for producing the hardware required.(For an interactive chart on global powertrain sales forecasts, click here tmsnrt.rs/2IdNUC7)By offering to supply electric vehicle hardware, and the know-how to integrate it into vehicles, Terashi said Toyota wants to reduce its capital outlay, and create a new source of revenue.“We anticipate that there will probably be very few automakers who use our patents to develop their own hybrids from scratch, so by using our system and our components, and offering our support, we can work together to develop these cars,�� Terashi said.In the last 20 years, Toyota has managed to dominate the global market for hybrid cars by constantly improving and lowering the cost of the technology it pioneered in the Prius - and keeping this expertise a closely guarded secret.Toyota’s new business foray underlines the challenges facing even the largest global automakers as they confront some of the most profound technological changes for automobiles in a century.Toyota is now trying to take advantage of its lead in refining hybrid vehicles, even as it runs behind global rivals such as Volkswagen AG and Tesla Inc in bringing fully electric vehicles to showrooms.Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor.Roughly 15 percent of Toyota’s annual global sales are hybrids, including the Corolla and the RAV4. Last year it sold 1.6 million hybrids globally, more than the 1.3 million all-battery EVs sold by Tesla Inc, Nissan Motor Co and all other automakers combined.To meet the expected surge in hybrid demand, Terashi said he is planning to increase production capacity for hybrid components mainly by adding capacity at existing plants.Toyota has initially courted its partner automakers. It already supplies the plug-in hybrid system for Subaru Corp’s Crosstrek SUV crossover model, and last month Toyota announced that it would be a global supplier of hybrid systems to compact car maker Suzuki Motor Co.The success of the Prius has helped to brand Toyota as a maker of affordable, reliable green cars and has been key to the automaker’s reputation as a leader in low-emissions vehicle technology.Terashi brushed off the risk that Toyota could lose this edge by offering its hybrid technology to other automakers, arguing that it held a crucial, 20-year head start over its rivals.“Even if an automaker is able to develop and produce a car using our systems and parts which complies with emissions regulations, its overall performance would never be the same as ours,�� he said.	-3.041731573
TOKYO, April 19 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks were nearly flat on Wednesday in choppy trade as investors refrained from taking large positions as geopolitical tensions soured the mood.The Nikkei 225 share average edged up 0.07 percent to 18,432.20 after traversing positive and negative territory, while the broader Topix was down 0.01 percent at 1,471.42.Regional banks Kita-Nippon Bank and Keiyo Bank both underperformed after the 10-year JGB yield hit 0 percent, its lowest level since mid November.Escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea kept investors nervous, while eyes were also on Europe where sterling surged after British Prime Minister Theresa May called an early general election for June 8, seeking to strengthen her party’s majority ahead of Brexit negotiations.Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 1.1 percent, Honda Motor Co shedding 1.2 percent and Panasonic Corp rising 0.7 percent.Shippers fell after the Baltic dry index, or freight charges, dropped overnight. Mitsui OSK Lines shed 2.1 percent and Nippon Yusen stumbled 3.1 percent.The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 0.1 percent to 13,174.08.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has reduced its number of top positions to speed up decision-making, as the Japanese automaker works toward a slimmer executive to better compete in an industry undergoing rapid change.The move comes as the world's second-ranked automaker by sales, after Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, hopes to quicken decision-making to regain the lead in an industry increasingly focused on new technologies, including automated driving and low-emission power units.Announcing personnel changes for the financial year starting April, the Japanese automaker on Wednesday said in a statement it would reduce its board of director positions to nine from 11.Under the new structure, only President Akio Toyoda and Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada will remain representative directors after Toyota cut the number of such posts from six.The automaker reduced the number of representative directors to centralize responsibility and accountability for the entire company, while fewer board directors would speed up executive decisions, Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi told Reuters.The change comes just a year after Toyota overhauled its corporate structure to one emphasizing product-based management rather than region-based.“This structural change is not an answer but an opportunity,�� President Toyoda said in the statement.He said the change was necessary to “allow us to remain viable in an era in which we are producing and selling 10 million vehicles a year.”Toyota’s scale affords benefits such as lower procurement and production costs. But it also raises quality-control risks, as the automaker experienced in the early 2000s when driver-side floor mats led to unintentional acceleration in some vehicles.Toyoda, who has led the company since 2009, previously said the automaker’s sheer size can slow down decision-making.Osamu Nagata, previously Toyota’s chief administrative officer in North America, will be promoted to chief financial officer and executive vice president, and joins the board of directors.Mitsuru Kawai will become executive vice president in charge of factories. Kawai joined Toyota as a plant worker in the 1960s, rising to the automaker’s highest position held by blue collar worker.Board directors Mitsuhisa Kato, Takahiko Ijichi and Nobuyori Kodaira will step down and become company advisors. Senior managing officers Hirofumi Muta, Koei Saga and Soichiro Okudaira will also step down.Muta will join affiliate Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T as executive vice president, whereas Saga will become an executive advisor at Toyota and chairman of the automaker's racing arm.Okudaira will head compact car maker Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd, which became a wholly-owned Toyota company last year.Operational changes will take effect from April, while board positions will be voted on at a shareholder meeting in June.	-4.294911368

TOKYO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co is considering diversifying its all-Japanese, all-male board by appointing a foreigner and could move as early as Monday, when it unveils its next slate of directors, sources close to the company said.“I think we have to think quite seriously, and we are thinking very, very seriously,�� Honda Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told Reuters when asked about naming a non-Japanese to the board. He was speaking on the sidelines of a plant opening in Celaya, Mexico, on Friday.Japan’s third-biggest carmaker, long considered a pioneer of Japanese globalisation with the likes of Sony Corp, now lags far behind Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co in building diversity in its executive ranks.Japan’s big companies are under pressure to bring in outsiders to bolster governance, risk management and global perspective, having traditionally chosen board members from senior male managers who had spent their careers at the company.Honda started assembling cars in the United States in 1982 - a Japanese first - and now makes and sells about 80 percent of its vehicles overseas.It has nevertheless resisted bringing foreigners into the upper echelons of its Tokyo headquarters, sources close to the company said, believing its largely autonomous regional operations, that include locally hired managers, have made it global enough.That attitude now appears to be changing as it seeks faster growth and puts more emphasis on emerging markets.The automaker recently consulted a major Japanese bank about diversifying its management board, an individual with knowledge of the matter said.Sources close to Honda also said the company was considering appointing a foreigner to the board within the next several years and did not rule out that it could name one among board members and executives to be announced on Monday for the new financial year that starts in April. They added, however, that the company was in no hurry to diversify.The company declined to comment on executive changes.Honda has already appointed non-Japanese to senior posts at regional subsidiaries. At American Honda Motor, John Mendel, formerly with Ford Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp, is executive vice president overseeing sales, and Mike Accavitti, previously with Chrysler, is senior vice president of auto operations.Iwamura, their boss, serves as president and chief executive of American Honda.It was unclear whether Honda was looking at potential foreign board candidates from inside or outside the company.Honda’s relative lack of diversity at the top contrasts with Japan’s other big automakers.Nissan, along with French partner Renault SA, is run by French-Lebanese Carlos Ghosn, while 15 of its 58 directors and auditors are non-Japanese and one is a woman.Toyota, seen as a stalwart of traditional Japanese management, last year appointed American Mark Hogan, a former General Motors Co executive, to its board. Of its 68 directors and auditors, seven are foreign and one is a woman.Honda last year adopted an ambitious goal to expand global sales to 6 million cars annually by the year to March 2017, a 50 percent jump from last year’s total.Some executives see a need to work more closely across regions - including joint procurement of parts and materials - to boost efficiency, the sources said.Honda is also aiming to raise the share of emerging markets in total sales and to revamp its vehicle development process, involving engineers across regions from the earliest stages.	-4.854953947

* China Nov vehicle sales up 8.2 pct yr-on-yr* Sales decline of Japanese cars eased in Nov vs Sept and Oct* Overall Dec sales to pick up on year-end promotionsBEIJING, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Vehicle sales in China rose 8.2 percent in November from a year earlier, with the pace of growth picking up from the previous month as Japanese car makers showed signs of recovering following a huge slump.Traffic to the showrooms is likely to pick up in December as automakers roll out aggressive year-end incentive schemes in a last-minute effort to achieve their annual sales targets.“December has been one of the peak selling months for all automakers. Growth will be quite solid if consumers continue to trickle back to Toyota and Nissan’s showrooms like they did last month,�� Sheng Ye, an analyst with industry consultancy Ipsos.Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp all saw their sales improve in November after slumping in the previous two months as consumers shunned Japanese brands following a territorial row between Beijing and Tokyo.Collectively, Japanese automakers sold 170,200 passenger cars in China last month, jumping 72.2 percent from October, but the figure was still down 36.1 percent from a year earlier, data from the China Association of Automotive Manufacturers (CAAM) showed on Monday.Their market share came to 16.6 percent at the end of last month compared to 17 percent at the end of October and 19.4 percent at the end of 2011.Industry-wide sales in China, including passenger cars and commercial vehicles, totalled 1.79 million in November, CAAM said.Vehicle sales rose 5.3 percent in October from a year earlier.Sales in the first 11 months came to 17.5 million, up 4 percent from a year earlier, with sales for the full year to top 19 million, according to Chen Shihua, director of information department of CAAM.The main question for next year is whether auto sales are going to resume double-digit growth after subdued growth in the past two years.Xu Changming, a government analyst with the State Information Center, is optimistic about a double-digit gain in 2013 as the economy recovers, while Bob Socia, head of General Motors Co’s China operations, expects a ��5 to 8 percent�� rise.“We are pretty bullish on the market overall,�� Socia said in a recent interview with Reuters. “SUVs are going to grow, luxuries are going to grow. We are looking at maybe 21 million next year.”In November, some non-Japanese automakers profited from the struggles facing their Japanese counterparts.Ford Motor’s China sales advanced 18 percent in November, while GM reported a 9.7 percent gain.Great Wall Motor delivered 39.2 percent more of its Haval SUVs in the month from a year earlier, picking up some of the slack left by Honda’s once hot-selling CR-V.Monthly sales of Dongfeng Motor Group Co, a partner for Nissan and Honda, however, fell 14.2 percent, although it was an improvement from the 25 percent decline in October.	11.33612663

Kyle Busch overcame starting from near the rear of the field because of a penalty for failing post-qualifying inspection, an out-of-sorts car early in the race and several late-race restarts to win Sunday’s Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.The victory in the Gander Outdoors 400 was the sixth of the year for the Joe Gibbs Racing driver and tied him with Kevin Harvick -- who also failed post-qualifying inspection and was penalized to the back of the field -- for the most in the series.“What an awesome race,�� Busch said. “My Toyota Camry was awesome. Had a lot of speed (late in the race), but man, we fought it all weekend.”It was Busch’s second win in 28 starts at the 2.5-mile Pocono “Tricky Triangle,�� and it came in overtime.Pole-sitter Daniel Suarez of JGR finished second, 1.7 seconds behind Busch.“Suarez, man. I can’t say enough about my teammate,�� Busch said.“I thought we were a solid top-three car,�� said Suarez, a native of Mexico whose finish was his best in a Cup race. “I felt like in the short run, we were actually the best car. I was better than the 18 (Busch). It’s a little disappointing.”Third was Alex Bowman in the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet.Rounding out the top five were Stewart-Haas racing’s Harvick and JGR’s Erik Jones.Busch took the lead for the first time with 48 laps to go. After that, restarts -- including one in overtime -- became his major obstacles.Suarez, who inherited the pole when Harvick was penalized, brought the field to the green flag in the No. 19 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota and led the first 21 laps.After that, the series�� big boys began to take over as Harvick, his teammate and past champion Kurt Busch and Kyle Busch took turns making their way to the front to lead double-digit laps.Collecting stage wins and points were Chase Elliott, who won the first state of the race and his second in as many weeks, and Harvick, who won the second stage, which was his 10th stage win of the season.Harvick, who appeared to have the fastest car on the track and who led 30 laps, saw his chance to get his first Pocono win end when his sustained body damage during a pit-road scrape with teammate Aric Almirola with 36 laps to go.Eleven drivers were forced to start from the rear of the field after failing post-qualifying inspection on Saturday.--Field Level Media	-5.556378723
DETROIT (Reuters) - Strong demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks in June helped General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N offset slowing demand for sedans by allowing them to raise prices on their trucks. GM and Ford said on Wednesday increases in the average transaction prices for their vehicles, particularly trucks and SUVs, outpaced sales volume growth that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Ford, for example, said prices for its F-series trucks rose 8 percent, or $3,600, while sales volume for the pickup truck line dropped 8.9 percent in June.U.S. June auto industry sales rose to about 1.48 million vehicles, up 4.5 percent from a year ago, said Bill Fay, a Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T U.S. sales executive. GM’s sales fell 3 percent last month as the company’s small cars slid from year-ago figures, including a 13 percent drop in Cruze compact sales. Sales of GM’s large SUVs also fell, reflecting fewer sales to fleets, a company spokesman said. But GM said average transaction prices for all vehicles rose almost $1,000 from a year earlier.GM said analysts may have not factored in to their expectations the automaker’s statement a month ago that its sales to rental agencies would fall 20 percent in June.GM shares were down 1.4 percent at $32.87 late on Wednesday morning. Ford shares were down 0.7 percent at $14.90.Toyota said the U.S. industry would have an annualized sales rate for June of 17.2 million vehicles.The National Automobile Dealers Association this week raised its forecast for 2015 U.S. auto sales to 17.2 million vehicles from 16.9 million. It would be the sixth straight year of solid gains since the recession.While Ford’s sales rose only 2 percent, it showed the largest increase in the market in the average price of its vehicles, industry consultant Kelley Blue Book said.Ford’s SUV sales rose 10 percent but car sales fell 3.5 percent.U.S. auto sales, often an early snapshot into consumer spending each month, are expected to rise about 5 percent for the industry. Truck and SUV sales will again grow at a faster pace than sedans, aided by the low gasoline prices.Toyota, No. 3 in the U.S market by sales, posted June sales of nearly 210,000 vehicles, up 4 percent, roughly in line with expectations.Honda Motor Co 7267.T showed sales of about 134,000 vehicles, up 4 percent from a year ago, on strong SUV sales.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCAU.NFCHA.MI U.S. June auto sales increased 8 percent from a year ago, boosted by the continued strength of its Jeep SUV brand.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T U.S. sales rose 13 percent, led by a 54 percent increase in its popular small SUV Rogue.Sales of Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep brand jumped 25 percent in June.Chrysler brand sales rose 28 percent, and its Chrysler 200 sedan sales were up 153 percent to 18,560 vehicles. Private industry data reviewed by Reuters showed that in the first half of the year, a large portion of Chrysler 200 sedan sales were to rental agencies.	0.3239171375
* Net profit seen falling 2.4 pct in current fiscal year* Year ended March 31 brought record net profit, up 90 pct* Fading forex boost a new challenge for President Toyoda (Updates with profit outlook, results, Toyoda comments)TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp warned earnings may fall this fiscal year as the export-boosting tailwind that it and other Japanese carmakers have received from the yen’s sharp depreciation over the past 18 months runs out of steam.For President Akio Toyoda, the “lull�� in prospect offers a different challenge to the major events that have marked his five years in charge, like the massive recalls of 2010, Japan’s 2011 tsunami and the boycott of Japanese products by Chinese consumers following a territorial dispute in late 2012.The world’s best-selling automaker said on Thursday it expects net profit to fall 2.4 percent to 1.78 trillion yen ($17.5 billion) in the financial year to March 2015. That’s well short of the 2.03 trillion yen mean estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.While Toyota typically issues conservative guidance, the decline is a marked reversal of a near doubling in net profit to a record 1.82 trillion yen for the year ended on March 31, buoyed by exports.As Toyoda briefed reporters in Tokyo, he explained that this year’s earnings may decline as Toyota rides out a shrinking Japanese auto market, hit by a sales tax hike in April, and a hiatus in vehicle launches. In future, he said, he wants a Toyota that can develop stable long-term growth rather than swinging between extremes of profit, like last year, or loss after major recalls or natural disasters.“I want Toyota to be a company that can continue growing, and that can avoid sharp setbacks or even maintain growth during times of crisis such as the Lehman shock,�� Toyoda said, adding that Toyota will invest more in training its employees as well as research and development to boost its competitiveness.“Sustainable growth is our most important goal, so what is essential is how this lull will lead to growth in the future,�� he said.In early reactions, observers described Toyota’s projections in pallid terms.“In their sales projections, they’re showing some confidence in the North American market where they’re projecting growth, but it remains a market where competition is tough,�� said Yoshihiro Okumura, general manager of the research department at Chibagin Asset Management. “�The scaled-back plans for Japan probably have factored in the impact of the increase in the sales tax. However you look at it, there is little new here to make you want to buy the stock.”This year’s forecast marks the first time in three years that the home of household-name models like the Corolla sedan and the Prius hybrid expects net profit to drop.The dollar has risen nearly 30 percent against the yen since mid-November 2012, when it first became clear that Shinzo Abe, who has been pledging to boost Japan’s economy, would take power as prime minister with measures that have weakened the domestic currency.Yet the decline in the value of the yen versus major currencies like the U.S. dollar and the euro appears to have run its course, after boosting the profitability of Toyota’s export sales to major markets like the United States. Last year currency moves boosted Toyota’s operating profit by 900 billion yen.The company this year expects foreign exchange movements to be a negative factor for its earnings, slicing 95 billion yen off its operating profit. The company expects a marginal increase in operating earnings this year, up 0.3 percent to 2.30 trillion yen.“Toyota is temporarily entering a lull this year as it gets ready for next year and beyond,�� said Koichi Sugimoto, a senior analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, speaking before Thursday’s disclosure. Sugimoto said Toyota isn’t expected to launch key new vehicles, including the remodelled Prius hybrid, until the fiscal year beginning April 2015.The conservative forecast echoes that of its peers. Rival Honda Motor Co said late last month that it sees net profit for this financial year growing just 3.6 percent, with weaker emerging markets�� currencies biting into profits.Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co said it expects net profit to fall 2 percent this year, while five out of seven auto parts makers in the Toyota group see profits down this year, including Denso Corp and Aisin Seki Co.Toyota has relentlessly cut around 300 billion yen in costs each year. Unlike rival automakers Nissan Motor Co and Honda that have been in expansion mode, Toyota has put a freeze on building new plants for three years since around early 2013.But for it to bolster growth, analysts say it must now invest more, especially to increase production capacity and marketing.“Toyota is reaching a turning point at which it will move from its emphasis on defence to significantly more active commitment to growth,�� Jefferies analyst Takaki Nakanishi said in a report before the Thursday forecasts were issued. Nakanishi said there’s an expectation that Toyota could soon show how it plans to expand capacity, though executives didn’t disclose such plans on Thursday.Toyota said its capital expenditure would increase marginally in 2014/15 to 1.02 trillion yen from last year’s 1.0 trillion yen.Toyota expects to sell 2.21 million vehicles in Japan in the year to March 2015, down 6.6 percent from last year, while overseas sales were seen growing 2.1 percent to 6.89 million vehicles. Toyota’s group sales figures include Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors.	5.694865436

BEIJING, April 21 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp said on Sunday it was setting up a research institute in Beijing in partnership with Tsinghua University to study car technology using hydrogen power and other green technologies that could ease environmental problems in China.The initiative, outlined by Toyota’s President and Chief Executive Akio Toyoda in a speech at Tsinghua University, is part of the Japanese carmaker’s efforts to share more technology with China as it seeks to expand its business in the country by beefing up manufacturing capacity and distribution channels, a source close to Toyota said.The Tsinghua-Toyota Joint Research Institute will conduct research into cars and new technology to solve environmental problems in China, including reducing traffic accidents, Toyota said in a statement.The institute will “cooperate in research not only related to cars for Chinese consumers, but also in research related to active utilization of hydrogen energy that can help solve China’s energy problems,�� the company said.The move dovetails with Toyota’s announcement this month that it would offer carmakers and suppliers around the world free access to nearly 24,000 patents for electric vehicle technologies.Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told Reuters earlier this month that the automaker intended to become a tier 2 supplier of hybrid systems and that it had already received enquiries from more than 50 companies.

* China says to halve some tariffs on U.S. imports* Nikkei leaps 2.4%, Topix up 2.1%* Trade turnover tops 3 trln yen, highest in 2 months* Earnings season in full swing in JapanTOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Japanese shares posted their biggest one-day gain in more than a year on Thursday as investor sentiment was buoyed after China cut tariffs on some imported goods from the United States, lifting some of the gloom from a fast-spreading virus outbreak.The benchmark Nikkei average jumped 2.4%, its most since late December 2018, to a two-week closing high of 23,873.59.The broader Topix advanced 2.1% to 1,736.98, also marking its best day in 13 months. Turnover on the main board hit 3.05 trillion yen ($27.7 billion), the highest since Dec. 13.“Although buying in index futures was the main driver of today’s market, more than 3 trillion yen worth of turnover (in cash equities) implies some real buying was also happening,�� said Takeo Kamai, head of executions services at CLSA in Tokyo.“The key here is whether we can clear the iron ceilings -- 24,000 in the Nikkei and 110 yen in the dollar/yen. If we break above those levels, we are likely to see more full-fledged buying from investors.”All of the 33 sector subindexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were in positive territory, led by cyclical sectors. Insurance , oil and coal products and precision machinery were the top three performing subindexes.Stocks extended earlier gains after China said it will halve tariffs on some U.S. goods from Feb. 14, corresponding with U.S. pledges to cut levies on some Chinese goods after the two sides reached a partial trade deal early last month.The announcement was seen by analysts as a move by Beijing to boost confidence amid the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted much of its economy and is increasingly rippling through global supply chains.“Under the phase 1 deal, China has to meet a tough target to increase U.S. imports by $100 billion this year, so a measure like this was necessary and expected,�� said Tomo-o Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management.“But at the same time, that they did this now points to their desire to support Chinese companies as the coronavirus epidemic will obviously deal a huge blow to China’s growth.”China said it hopes to work with the United States to eliminate all tariff increases in future.Overnight, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.1% to a record close and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4% to an all-time peak, while the Dow advanced 1.7%, following an upbeat ADP private sector jobs report and ISM’s non-manufacturing index.The greenback hit a two-week high of 109.985 yen, providing a tailwind for Japanese exporters, as a weaker local currency boosts corporate profits when they are repatriated.With the earnings season in full swing in Japan, Toyota Motor Corp rose 2.6% after the country’s biggest automaker raised its forecast for annual operating profit by 4.2%, citing favourable currency rates and better-than-expected vehicle sales.Pan Pacific International Holdings Corp soared 17.7% after the discounter Don Quijote’s parent raised its operating profit forecast for the year ending June.Z Holdings Corp surged 6.0% after the internet services firm reported a net profit of 75.1 billion yen for the April-December period, up 7% from a year earlier, due to its consolidated subsidiary of ZoZo.Bucking the overall firmness, DeNA Co Ltd dived 9.7% after the mobile partner of Nintendo booked a 49.4 billion yen writedown as its gaming business falters in Japan’s saturated mobile market.Although the financial markets found some comfort, traders admitted concerns about the coronavirus outbreak and its broader impact on individual companies and the economy.The death toll in mainland China jumped by 73 to 563 as experts intensified efforts to find a vaccine for the disease that has shut down Chinese cities and forced thousands more into quarantine around the world.Drugmakers and the World Health Organization played down reports about progress towards finding treatments, which had boosted traders�� confidence.	-13.73471969
Jones dominates in Texas for first win of yearBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeFORT WORTH, Texas -- What a difference a pit stop made.Erik Jones gained two seconds over Ryan Blaney on his final trip to pit road and that was all the driver of the No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota needed for a convincing victory in Saturday’s My Bariatric Solutions 300 NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Texas Motor Speedway.In winning for the second time at Texas, the first time this season and the seventh time in his career, Jones led 112 of the 200 laps and stretched his advantage to more than three seconds in the late going before driving conservatively over the last three laps and beating Blaney to the stripe by .512 seconds.“I tiptoed a lot there in the segments and ended up letting the 22 (Blaney) catch us and pass us, but then I was just super aggressive the whole time in traffic just trying to make passes as quick as I could and get as many cars as I could between myself and Ryan, and it paid off,�� Jones said.“I think we were probably a little slower than him for the last few laps -- he had so many lapped cars to get around that there was no way he was going to get to us.”Kevin Harvick ran third, 21.383 seconds behind Jones, as only nine drivers finished on the lead lap. Austin Dillon was fourth, followed by Sunoco rookie Cole Custer, who posted a career-best fifth, and Darrell Wallace Jr., who finished sixth for the fifth consecutive race.With the final stage of the race going green from a restart on lap 98 to the conclusion, Blaney ran down Jones and passed him for the lead on lap 131. Jones came to pit road for fresh tires and fuel on lap 147 and Blaney followed a lap later.In the exchange of stops, Jones went from a half-second behind to 2.178 seconds ahead of the runner-up, and from that point on it was game over.“I thought our car was pretty good all day,�� Blaney said. “The 20 seemed to be a little better than us for 35 or 40 laps. Then I feel like we could start running him down. We passed him before the last pit stop, and I thought our car was pretty decent right there. I needed to turn a little better early in a run. I knew it wasn’t going to be that long for the next stint.“We didn’t come out with the lead, and that hurt us. I think if we would have come out with the lead, I don’t know if I could have held him off. He was pretty good right away, but we kind of over-adjusted and got too free that last run. I felt like we were kind of even with them 10 laps into a run, but then he got so far out ahead that we couldn’t run him down. Just couldn’t get there.”Stage racing played a decisive role in strategies employed by NASCAR Xfinity Series regulars versus Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series drivers moonlighting in Saturday’s race. When Garrett Smithley’s spin off Turn 2 brought out the fifth caution on lap 84, most of the Cup drivers came to pit road.The Xfinity regulars, on the other hand, stayed on the track under the yellow to collect points at the end of the second stage, which concluded on lap 90. William Byron won the stage and the accompanying playoff point, leading nine Xfinity regulars in the top 10 in that stage.In contrast, Jones won the first stage, which featured only three full-time Xfinity drivers in the top 10.Despite finishing 10th as the first driver one lap down, Elliott Sadler retained the series lead by six points over Byron in second place.NASCAR Xfinity Series Race - My Bariatric Solutions 300Texas Motor SpeedwayFort Worth, TexasSaturday, April 8, 20171.

April 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp:* SAYS REPORTED MARCH 2018 SALES OF 222,782 VEHICLES, AN INCREASE OF 3.5 PERCENT FROM MARCH 2017 ON A VOLUME BASIS* WITH ONE MORE SELLING DAY IN MARCH 2018 COMPARED TO MARCH 2017, SALES DOWN 0.2 PERCENT ON DAILY SELLING RATE BASIS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:	2.78647464
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is gearing up for Brazil's battered auto market to return to growth in 2017, after a four-year crisis halved overall vehicle sales, the automaker's top executive in Latin America said.Yet Steve St. Angelo - who has tripled Toyota’s market share in Brazil during the crisis - says he is losing sleep over one scenario: what if the market comes back too quickly?“If that volume comes back, how do we keep our market share?�� said St. Angelo, head of Toyota in South and Central America and the Caribbean, in an interview ahead of this week’s Sao Paulo Auto Show.“We don’t have the production facilities. Are the dealers prepared for that kind of volume? The short answer is: I worry about it,�� he added. “This is what keeps me up at night.”Toyota sold nearly 148,000 cars and light trucks in Brazil in the first ten months of 2016, up 1 percent from a year earlier, moving to fifth place in the Brazil market from eighth just a few years ago.St. Angelo, who credits meticulous customer service for keeping loyal customers during the downturn, has the enviable problem of contemplating a third shift at Toyota’s plants in Brazil, while rivals are using less than half of their capacity.Toyota has avoided the widespread layoffs that cut 25,000 jobs from the Brazilian auto industry in two years.Across Latin America, the Japanese automaker has become a outlier under St. Angelo, doubling down while other carmakers pulled back amid economic crises in Brazil, Argentina and even Venezuela.So far, the strategy has won a larger slice of a shrinking pie. Toyota forecasts growing sales in core markets of North America, Asia and Europe, but an aggregate drop in markets such as Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, raising questions about return on investments there.An $800 million expansion of a Toyota factory in Argentina looked like folly to many in 2013, with the country on the verge of its second default in a dozen years.“When I announced that, some suppliers and competitors called to ask me, ‘Steve, are you crazy?’� said St. Angelo.Yet the economy has stabilized under new President Mauricio Macri and Argentina has become an export hub for Toyota. It is already using half of its new capacity at the Zarate plant.Brazil is unlikely to make such a swift turnaround, according to St. Angelo, as high interest rates and unemployment continue to weigh on demand.An export-driven rebound would also be a stretch for the Brazilian industry, he said, given the inflexible labor laws, poor transportation infrastructure, huge tax burden and weak supply chains that push up costs compared to global competition.Toyota opened its third Brazilian car plant at the peak of the market in 2012, making the newly launched Etios subcompact. It employs more than 5,500 people in Brazil.But manufacturing costs are one reason Toyota has held off bringing its subcompact SUV crossover C-HR to Brazil, where Honda Motor Co 7267.T has found a hit with its locally made rival HRV.“There are no plans to bring C-HR to Brazil. We even looked at manufacturing here, but it was just too expensive,�� said St. Angelo.Still, Toyota is bringing a C-HR concept car to the Sao Paulo show this week to gauge interest, St Angelo said. A Yaris concept car at the 2015 Buenos Aires Auto Show stirred enough interest to start importing that car to Argentina, he added.Instead of launching new models in Brazil, St. Angelo said he is focused on expanding a network of dealerships that can provide the customer service he credits for Toyota’s recent success.Maintaining service standards at an expanding network of dealerships can be as difficult as ramping up assembly lines, he said, citing a recent slip in customer satisfaction at Argentine dealerships that he quickly addressed.St. Angelo also expects Toyota’s patience to pay off sooner or later in Venezuela, where the company has held on to workers despite a ravaging economic crisis that dropped new car sales from 600,000 per year to around 10,000 per year.To test its cost-cutting ability and keep its factory open, Toyota even repurposed a Venezuelan assembly line to make parts for export to Argentina.“It was a breakthrough for us ... and I’m not ending there. I’m challenging them,�� he added. “Can you get competitive so maybe one day they can export to Cuba? Why not?��	7.907916703
* Chrysler ousts Ford as No. 1 in sales in Canada in January* Analysts have optimistic outlook for 2013 vehicle sales* Japan carmakers sales dip vs very strong comparablesFeb 1 (Reuters) - Auto sales in Canada slipped 2.2 percent in January, data showed on Friday, on weaker demand for European vehicles and strong comparable data from a year ago when Japan’s automakers were rebounding from earthquake and tsunami disruptions.While Canadian demand for vehicles made by Toyota Motor Corp and Audi fell sharply last month, appetite for vehicles assembled by Detroit’s Big Three automakers rose as buyers snapped up their more fuel-efficient passenger cars.“The Detroit Three enjoyed a great month, growing their combined market share from 45.6 percent to 49.2 percent,�� independent industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers said.He cautioned, however, that maintaining that share, which foreign automakers have been eating into for the past few years, “will be a challenge.”Overall, the industry sold 95,306 vehicles in January, down from 97,497 in January 2012 when sales jumped more than 15 percent amid recovering production at Japanese automakers following the devastating earthquake- and tsunami-caused major supply disruptions.Despite last month’s dip, DesRosiers said it looked as if the year “is off to a solid start.”After a strong 2012, Canadian vehicle sales are expected to continue to increase this year, nearing - or even exceeding - the record of 1.7 million set in full-year 2002 on the back of pent-up demand left over from the recession and higher employment especially in Western Canada, analysts have said.Chrysler Canada was No. 1 in sales in January, ousting Ford of Canada, as the unit of Fiat SpA’s Chrysler LLC increased sales by 2.6 percent to 17,013. This was Chrysler’s best January performance since 1996.Chrysler’s sales of cars rose 1.5 percent to 2,566 while its truck sales increased 2.8 percent to 14,447.Ford of Canada, a unit of Ford Motor Co, came in at No. 2 with an 8.1 percent jump in sales to 16,197, its best January performance in 10 years.Car sales at Ford, which includes the Ford Fusion and Ford Focus models, increased 24 percent to 3,634 while truck sales rose 4.3 percent to 12,563.“With forecasts showing that 2013 could be a record sales year, we see lot of opportunity for sales growth for Ford,�� said Ford of Canada President and Chief Executive Dianne Craig.General Motors of Canada, a subsidiary of General Motors Inc , came in at third place with sales up 6.2 percent in January to 13,761, the company said, led by a 40 percent surge in compact car sales. This is a marked turnaround from a nearly 7 percent fall in sales in 2012 at the company, which sells Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands.“We are looking forward to further momentum in 2013 driven by our aggressive launch cadence, where approximately 70 percent of our vehicles will be all-new or significantly refreshed,�� said Marc Comeau, GM of Canada’s vice president of sales, service and marketing.Toyota Canada said it sold 9,438 vehicles last month, down 11.5 percent, partly because of a shortage of RAV4 inventory in advance of the launch this month of an all-new 2013 RAV4 model.Honda Motor Corp’s sales were down 26.5 percent to 6,211. And Audi’s fell 26.2 percent to 1,107.In the United States, several major automakers, including GM and Toyota Motor Corp, posted better-than-expected U.S. vehicle sales for January, kicking off the fourth straight year of the sector’s recovery from the depths of recession.	4.712255954
* Automakers rally on growing expectation of monetary easing* Honda jumps 6.2 pct, Toyota up 3.5 pct, Nissan rises 5.5 pctTOKYO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Hopes that Japan’s central bank would obey incoming prime minister Shinzo Abe’s call to print more money and weaken the yen sparked a sharp rally on Wednesday among auto stocks, lifting Tokyo’s market to its biggest gain in over a year.Honda Motor led the gains, rising 6 percent, while Nissan Motor climbed 5.5 percent and Toyota Motor rose 3.5 percent. The three stocks helped push the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average up 2.4 percent to above 10,000 for the first time in almost nine months.The Bank of Japan is likely to ease monetary policy at the close of its policy-setting meeting this week and sources close to the bank say it may also consider doubling its target for inflation next month in response to increasing pressure from Abe after his Liberal Democratic Party swept back into power with a landslide victory in parliamentary elections last Sunday.“There are expectations for the incoming Abe government, monetary policy easing and a supplementary budget, which leads to greater expectations for a weaker yen,�� said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at Advanced Research.“And now, it seems like the U.S. fiscal problems will be sorted. A weaker yen and a steady U.S. economy are two biggest positive factors for auto stocks.”Japan’s auto exporters are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the yen, which rose to a record high of 75.311 yen to the dollar in October 2011. A stronger yen reduces what car makers and their suppliers earn overseas and hurts their ability to match competitors such as South Korea’s Hyundai Motors on price.Since Abe called for the BOJ to undertake bolder steps including “unlimited easing��, the yen has fallen about 5 percent. That in turn has boosted the appeal of automakers�� shares.The yen was quoted at 84.33 to the dollar on Wednesday but still far from the 100 yen level around which Japanese carmakers would like to see the Japanese currency trade.Endo said with many Japanese electronic firms struggling, investors were focused on auto stocks more than ever.“Investors, especially foreign institutional investors are starting to feel that they are in trouble if they don’t have Japanese stocks. Key institutional investors, excluding hedge funds, have yet to catch up on the market, and they will start buying,�� he said.The transport equipment index has rallied 25.9 percent over the past five weeks, outpacing a 17.3 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei.Signs of progress in negotiations to avoid spending cuts and tax increases in the United States in the so-called fiscal cliff also lifted sentiment in the Tokyo market. The United States is one of the biggest markets for Japanese carmakers.But some analysts said the weak yen might not be enough to help the Japanese auto industry. Morgan Stanley MUFG downgraded auto parts makers Aisin Seiki Co Ltd and Calsonic Kansei Corp on Friday.“A weak yen is positive, but we do not see industry earnings growing while non-U.S. autos demand remains uncertain and costs to offshore production rise,�� Morgan Stanley MUFG wrote in a note.In terms of valuations, auto and parts makers carry a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.4, much cheaper than the broader market’s 12.6, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.Of the Big Three, Nissan has the cheapest valuation, with its 12-month forward P/E of 8.1 versus Honda’s 10.5 and Toyota’s 11.6.Taizo Ishida, lead portfolio manager of the Matthews Japan Fund at Matthews International Capital Management in San Francisco, had Toyota as his number four top holding as of Nov. 30.“This year, we made sort of a tactical change in the beginning of the year, saying, the yen is too strong, this is a problem, meaning we didn’t have much in exporters, for example, Toyota. We didn’t have much in weak-yen, big-cap type of companies,�� he told Reuters late last month.“Toyota, the company came out of three, four years of miserable problems,�� such as recalls, the March 2011 earthquake and Thai floods, he said.“I don’t think I had Toyota for a long time, but the fundamentals are definitely coming together.�� (Additonal reporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)	2.375040484
PARIS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Toyota decided to drop diesel engines from its new C-HR compact in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal and would do the same for future model renewals, the carmaker’s second-ranking global executive said on Thursday.The Japanese automaker decided “within the last six to 12 months�� not to offer a diesel version of the car, unveiled at the Paris auto show, because demand for the powertrain technology is falling sharply, Executive Vice President Didier Leroy told Reuters in an interview.If faced with a renewal decision today for other models up to and including the larger Auris compact, a Toyota staple, “we would probably do the same thing��, Leroy added.Reuters revealed this month that Renault expects diesel engines to disappear from most of its European cars after the French automaker reviewed the costs of meeting tighter emissions standards following the Volkswagen scandal.	-0.3446493193
PARIS (Reuters) - Toyota Tsusho Corp 8015.T has agreed to buy a 29.8 percent stake in distribution firm CFAO CFAO.PA from French luxury and retail group PPR PRTP.PA and may launch an offer for the whole company valuing it at 2.3 billion euros ($2.79 billion).The Japanese conglomerate is paying 37.50 euros a share for the stake in CFAO and any offer for the remainder of the group would be at the same price, PPR said in a statement on Thursday.That is below where CFAO shares closed on Wednesday, but the distributor of vehicles and medicines in Africa and French overseas territories had already rallied 44 percent this year.CFAO shares were trading up 4.9 percent at 39.64 by 03.35 a.m. EDT, above the offer price. Shares in PPR were 2.6 percent higher at 111.35 euros, among the top gainers on France's blue-chip CAC 40 index .FCHI.PPR has agreed to tender its remaining 12.2 percent stake in CFAO to any full offer, while Toyota Tsusho has accepted to pay an indemnity of 50 million euros to PPR in case it does not file a voluntary tender offer by September 15.Toyota Tsusho will proceed with the tender offer once it performs due diligence on CFAO’s non-automotive businesses in the coming weeks, PPR said.The French luxury goods company would receive 967.5 million euros for its entire 42 stake.CFAO generated sales of 3.1 billion in 2011. PPR sold nearly 58 percent of CFAO in a stock market listing in late 2009.Japanese conglomerate Toyota Tsusho has been expanding its automotive distribution business as well as other businesses such as energy, healthcare products, chemicals, machinery and consumer products.($1 = 0.8248 euros)	10.09310484
(Adds latest warning from U.S. regulator, Takata comment)DETROIT, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The problems for Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp grew after U.S. safety regulators expanded a warning about faulty air bags to 6.1 million vehicles in the United States while two more lawsuits have been filed over accidents in older Honda cars.The news came a day after Toyota Motor Corp recalled 247,000 vehicles in the United States because of potentially defective Takata air bags that can rupture and spray metal shrapnel at occupants.“The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) urges owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors vehicles to act immediately on recall notices to replace defective Takata air bags,�� the regulator said in a statement on Tuesday.“Over six million vehicles are involved in these recalls, which have occurred as far back as 18 months ago and as recently as Monday.”The previous NHTSA warning, issued on Monday, covered 4.74 million vehicles, and dragged Takata’s shares down 23 percent on Tuesday in Tokyo, the stock’s biggest-ever one-day drop.Its shares were initially up 7.5 percent early on Wednesday, but quickly fell back to trade flat, leaving them down 44 percent so far this year.In a statement released before the most recent NHTSA warning was issued, Takata said it would cooperate with U.S. authorities and automakers.Takata said the cost of repairs for the 4.74 million vehicles subject to the NHTSA’s earlier bulletin had been set aside, and that any additional costs would be minimal.The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said on Tuesday it was seeking information about the air bag defects from NHTSA and automobile manufacturers.Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, where some of the air bag incidents have occurred, wrote to NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman urging the agency to further expand the recalls.“NHTSA should ensure that owners of cars that are not registered in Florida, but spend a substantial portion of the year operating in the state of Florida are covered by the recall,�� Nelson wrote.He was referring to “snowbirds��, people who spend winters in Florida to escape the cold in the northern part of the United States.Cars produced by nine automakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Chrysler Group are affected by regional recalls that started in June.They began in certain high-humidity areas of the United States after the NHTSA started investigating reports of air bag explosions in Florida and Puerto Rico.The NHTSA is investigating whether Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.More than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled because of defective Takata air bags since 2008.The two accidents resulting in lawsuits against Honda and Takata both took place in Florida.A Honda spokesman declined to comment on both lawsuits because they are pending. A Takata spokesman referred questions to Honda.According to an accident report and lawsuit filed in July in a Florida state court, Corey Burdick, 26, was driving his 2001 Honda Civic in Eustis, Florida, on May 29 when he was involved in an accident with another vehicle.The accident report said an eye injury Burdick suffered was “possibly caused by the air bag deployment.�� The lawsuit, which is seeking damages above $15,000, said “shards of metal were propelled through the air bag’s fabric and struck Corey Burdick in the eye, resulting in disfigurement, impaired vision and other severe permanent injuries.”In the second accident, Stephanie Erdman, a then 28-year Texan stationed at a military base in Florida, was driving her 2002 Civic in Santa Rosa County when she was involved in an accident with another vehicle on Sept. 1, 2013, according to an accident report and lawsuit.The lawsuit described how “shards of metal, like shrapnel, were propelled toward Stephanie Erdman ... striking (her) in the face and right eye.�� It included a picture of her bloody face and the metal lodged in her eye.Erdman’s lawsuit, which is seeking more than $1 million in damages, was filed in May in Texas, where she bought the car.	8.03420326
(Adds analyst comment, final annual sales rate figure, luxury sales, details)DETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp posted stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. auto sales in July but most manufacturers on Friday reported gains below expectations as several months of strong demand pushed optimism too high.Ford’s sales were up 10 percent at 212,236, with Toyota’s up 12 percent at 215,802 due to strong demand for their SUVs as well as offering larger discounts.Industry sales were up 9 percent from last year to 1,433,016 vehicles, but that still fell short of the 11 percent gain analysts polled by Reuters had expected.“Given the strength we saw over the last several months, the industry (growth) came back down at a little bit of a quicker pace than perhaps we had originally anticipated,�� said Alec Gutierrez, analyst with industry research firm Kelley Blue Book. “I wouldn’t say the industry missed the mark too egregiously.”Toyota was the No. 2 seller in July, edging past Ford, which had held that spot for the first half of this year and for 2013 overall. General Motors Co remained in top place.Incentives played a strong role in July sales.Honda Motor Co was the only one of the top car companies to cut incentives from June to July, research firm J.D. Power said. Honda’s July sales tumbled 8 percent to 135,908.Average industry discounts last month rose slightly to just over $3,000 per vehicle, with Ford incentives averaging close to $3,919. Industry incentives were the highest since 2010, said Larry Dominique, president of research firm ALG.GM, Nissan Motor Co, Chrysler Group LLC and the Hyundai-Kia Group all reported higher July sales that nonetheless failed to meet analysts�� expectations. The sales were Hyundai’s best for July ever, while GM, Ford and Chrysler saw their strongest results for the month since before the 2008 recession.GM said July sales were up 9 percent at 256,160. Also reporting increases were Chrysler, up 20 percent at 167,667; Nissan, up 11 percent at 121,452; and Hyundai-Kia, up 4 percent at 119,320.The Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, said sales fell 6 percent to 49,469.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said growth slowed further than expected as the annualized sales rate in the month fell to 16.48 million vehicles according to research firm Autodata, from 17 million in June. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the annualized rate in July to ease slightly to 16.7 million.With generous credit terms drawing buyers to more expensive vehicles, transaction prices in July remained firm, averaging $32,556 per vehicle, KBB said.Ford said average prices on its full-size F-Series pickups topped $40,000, while GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra’s average prices were close to $39,000.Sales growth of full-size pickup trucks, a bellwether for the U.S. economy, slowed in July.Sales of Ford’s best-selling F-Series rose 5 percent to 63,240 vehicles. GM’s full-size Silverado had flat sales at 42,097, while the Sierra was up 5 percent to 17,488. Chrysler’s Ram pickup climbed 14 percent to 35,621.In the luxury segment, Toyota’s Lexus overtook Mercedes and BMW for the sales crown in July. Lexus sold 27,333 vehicles to 27,192 for Mercedes and 26,409 for BMW. It was the first time Lexus outsold its German rivals since August 2013, KBB said.Gains in U.S. auto sales have been stronger than the overall economy since the recession. Still, the monthly figures provide an early glimpse into consumer spending.Auto sales dropped to a low of 10.4 million vehicles in 2009 and have risen steadily since, in part because of easier credit and loans of up to 84 months. They reached 15.6 million last year. (Editing by Mark Potter, Lisa Von Ahn and Lisa Shumaker)	-1.625465628
(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text)DETROIT Nov 12 (Reuters) - It is the automotive equivalent of Pavlov’s bell: when gasoline is expensive, U.S. car owners try to downsize, but once pump prices ring down, they salivate over big pickup trucks and SUVs.With gas prices dipping below $3 a gallon last month for the first time since December 2010, size is back in vogue.“The migration to trucks will turn into a stampede if these gas prices go lower or stay low,�� Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc, leading U.S. auto retailer, told Reuters.“Americans just love big.”Helping fuel the upswing is an improving economy and better fuel efficiency that allows people to go for size and feel less guilty about it.“A new Ford Escape (crossover SUV) is more fuel efficient than a 10-year-old Camry,�� says Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson. “The days of having to be ashamed of your Yukon seem to be fading,�� he said, referring to General Motors�� full-sized SUV powered by a V8 engine.Analysts and industry executives say SUV and truck sales have been rising already before fuel prices fell and cheaper gas could sustain the trend into 2015.In October, for instance, SUVs and trucks accounted for 72 percent of Ford’s sales, up from 68.5 percent a year ago, while Chrysler’s sales surged 22 percent thanks to strong demand for its Ram pickups and Jeep SUVs.With a greater share of big vehicles in their line-up than their European, Japanese and Korean rivals, the Detroit three - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are well placed to cash in on the trend.Pickups and SUVs remain a pillar of profitability for Detroit, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. automakers�� global pre-tax earnings, even though they make up just 16 percent of North American vehicle production.So far this year, they account for 77 percent of Chrysler’s U.S. sales, 68 percent of Ford’s and 54 percent of GM’s. compared with roughly 45 percent for Toyota and Honda and less for other rivals.Electric and hybrid vehicles that account for 2 percent of U.S. sales, are the big losers, with October sales of Toyota Prius down over 13 percent from a year ago, Ford C-Max down over 22 percent and Chevrolet Volt sales down about 29 percent.The challenge for carmakers is how do you adjust to buying patterns that follow wild swings in gasoline prices?AutoNation’s Jackson says you simply can’t and recalls 2008 when prices spiked above $4 in the summer to end the year around $1.60.“I was trading in Escalades on Smarts and by December they wanted the Escalade back.”Among Detroit’s Big Three, Ford is betting that fuel economy will remain a selling point, investing in its redesigned, more aluminum-intensive F-150 full-size pickup truck.Chrysler appears to be hedging its bets with its U.S. sales chief Reid Bigland talking of “very limited�� impact of gas prices so far.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday upheld an $11 million verdict against Toyota Motor Corp over a fatal 2006 car crash in Minnesota, which a jury found was caused by an accelerator defect in a 1996 Camry.A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Minnesota jury had enough evidence to conclude in 2015 that Toyota was 60 percent liable for the crash and that the driver of the Camry, Koua Fong Lee, was 40 percent liable.Lee was criminally charged in connection with the crash and served nearly three years in prison for vehicular homicide, according to his lawyer, Robert Hilliard. In 2010, when reports of unintended acceleration in other Toyota vehicles surfaced, Lee won a motion to set aside his conviction, and he was released from prison.The car in the accident was not covered by Toyota’s recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2010 over acceleration issues.“I’m grateful to the 8th Circuit but I’m also relieved for Mr. Lee’s family,�� Hilliard said of Friday’s decision.“We sympathize with everyone affected by this unfortunate accident from 2006,�� Toyota said in a statement. “While we respect the 8th Circuit’s decision, we continue to believe the evidence shows that Mr. Lee’s 1996 Camry was well-designed and was not the cause of this accident.”A lawyer representing other people injured in the accident could not immediately be reached for comment.The Minnesota trial stemmed from a lawsuit filed on behalf of passengers injured or killed in the 2006 crash in St. Paul, Minnesota.Lee, who later joined the lawsuit, said he was driving his 1996 Toyota Camry when it inexplicably began to accelerate as he approached other vehicles stopped at an intersection.The Camry slammed into an Oldsmobile Ciera, killing the driver, Javis Trice-Adams Sr., as well as his 9-year-old son, according to the 2010 lawsuit. A 6-year-old girl who was also in the car was paralyzed and later died. Two other passengers were seriously injured, according to the lawsuit.Though it upheld the jury’s findings, the 8th Circuit on Friday did find that the trial court judge had improperly calculated the damages for Bridgette Trice, mother of the 6-year-old, Devyn Bolton, and ordered that the amount be recalculated.	1.662752466
TOKYO, March 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), on Wednesday agreed to an average annual pay raise of 8,600 yen ($82.15) per month in the year starting April, the Nikkei newspaper reported.The rise was less than union demands for an average rise of 10,100 yen per month, the Nikkei said, and lower than last year’s increase of 10,700 yen.Toyota declined to comment when asked about the report.	-1.246029807

TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, Japan’s top automaker, said quarterly operating profit jumped more than five-fold to $3 billion and would treble in the current year as vehicle production roars back from post-disaster lows.January-March operating profit increased to 238.5 billion yen beating a consensus estimate of 223 billion yen in a survey of 23 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter net profit jumped to 121 billion yen from 25.4 billion yen a year ago.For the year to next March, Toyota forecast operating profit would rise to 1 trillion yen ($12.54 billion), its highest since the global financial crisis. Consensus forecasts have been for a full-year profit of 990 billion yen.Toyota shares have gained more than a third since the broad market trough in late-November, outperforming local rivals Nissan and Honda, U.S. competitors General Motors and Ford and Volkswagen, but lagging BMW’s 41 percent jump.

(Attaches to additional alerts)TOKYO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Japan’s transport minister said on Friday he was concerned that repeated recalls involving Takata Corp’s potentially defective air bags could undermine trust in the country’s auto industry and manufacturing quality.Akihiro Ohta also said the ministry has asked Takata to report on how it plans to respond to the U.S. auto regulator’s recent call to expand recalls nationwide in the United States.Japan formed a special task force this month to deal with the growing recall crisis. Toyota Motor Corp and its small-car subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co announced new recalls on Thursday, citing excessive moisture during a manufacturing process at Takata’s now-shuttered plant in LaGrange, Georgia.

CAIRO (Reuters) - A consortium led by Toyota Tsusho Corp 8015.T, a unit of Japan's Toyota Group, signed a contract on Thursday to set up and operate a roll-on, roll-off vehicle terminal at East Port Said in Egypt, the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) said. The consortium, which also includes Bollore Africa Logistics BOLL.PA and Nippon Yusen Kaisha, will develop and operate a 600-metre quay and a new 21.2-hectare terminal for the import, export and transshipment of vehicles, an SCZone statement said. It will invest $150 million in equipment and infrastructure to enable the terminal to handle 800,000 vehicles a year, plus an annual $233 million for the operating concession, the statement quoted SCZone chairman Yehia Zaki as saying.East Port Said lies along the Mediterranean entrance to the Suez Canal, which is the fastest shipping route between Europe and Asia and one of the Egyptian government’s main sources of foreign currency.The government hopes to turn East Port Said into a major transshipment hub, meaning goods will flow through the facility on the way to other destinations.	0.2887934071
(Corrects to September not March in first paragraph)TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp and other Japanese steelmakers fell on Thursday after media reports the country’s biggest producer of steel had agreed on price cuts for the six months through September with Toyota Motor Corp.Nippon Steel, which agrees on prices with Toyota on a twice-yearly basis that are considered a benchmark for both industries, had earlier said it wanted to raise prices for its main customers.The Nikkei business daily reported that Toyota will drop its wholesale steel prices for its parts suppliers by around 5,000 yen ($46) per tonne in the October-to-March period.The cuts come after Japan’s biggest automaker concluded negotiations with Nippon Steel and is passing reductions in prices on to suppliers, the Nikkei said.Nippon Steel was down 3 percent at 0022 GMT, while JFE Holdings Inc lost more than 4 percent. Kobe Steel Ltd was down more than 5 percent. The broader Tokyo market was off by 0.3 percent. ($1 = 108.9800 yen) (Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim)	7.797184103
* Operating profit for FY 2012/13 hits 1.32 tln yen* Toyota met mid-term profit and margin goal in FY 2012/13* Toyota not building new plants for three yearsTOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp refuses to be tempted away from its low-risk growth strategy, even as the world’s bestselling carmaker met its mid-term profit goals in the year ended March, and foresees even higher earnings this fiscal year.The company has exceeded the target President Akio Toyoda set two years ago: to make 1 trillion yen in annual operating profit, and do so with a 5 percent margin. Its manufacturing arm in Japan also made a profit for the first time in five years, a symbolic triumph for a titan of Japanese industry.This year, the company will concentrate on sharpening productivity in order to become more competitive, Toyoda said.Mindful of lessons learned from huge losses run up in 2008 after a period of boom and rapid expansion, it sees high profits as no reason to launch into a building programme - even as some rivals do exactly that.“The wind that was blowing against us is calming down, and we can hear some saying that it is the time for us to take the offensive. But I think we are just standing at the startline of sustainable growth��, the 57-year-old grandson of the founder of Toyota’s automotive business told reporters on Wednesday.Toyota expects to make operating profit of 1.8 trillion yen ($18.17 billion) in the fiscal year that ends March 2014, which would be below its peak of 2.3 trillion yen in the year ended March 2008Powering that will be another year of record group sales in calendar year 2013, the company believes, reaching 9.91 million vehicles. It could become the first carmaker in history to sell more than 10 million vehicles in a year.Since Toyoda took helm in 2009, when profit margins were thin, the automaker has focused on cutting costs and improving profitability.Evidence of Toyoda’s caution is his fresh policy to build no new factories for the next three years, a sharp contrast with Honda Motor Co which is rapidly adding to its production power around the world.“Expansion of volume does not equate to growth. The driving force of sustainable growth comes down to making ever better cars,�� Toyoda said.Toyota posted on Wednesday an annual operating profit of 1.32 trillion yen with an operating margin of around 6 percent, beating a market that had expected 1.26 trillion yen profit, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine’s SmartEstimates. SmartEstimates place emphasis on timely forecasts by top-rated analysts.It said it expects to sell 2.2 million vehicles in the United States in 2013, up from about 2.1 million in 2012. The company is expected to release the Corolla compact car in the United States this year.“While the fierce competitive landscape (in the U.S.) will likely mean that Toyota may see growth taper off in the short term, new product launches later this year should help to give sales a boost,�� said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.In Japan, where automotive-related jobs account for 8.7 percent of the workforce, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, it is becoming more profitable to make and export goods as a result of a yen that has weakened by around 15 percent against the dollar since January.Toyoda repeated his vow to continue making 3 million vehicles a year in Japan. The company exports 60 percent of its Japan-made vehicles.Despite building no new plants Toyota, which currently has an annual production capacity of around 9 million vehicles, will still be able to make more cars.It will stick with pre-existing plans to build new factories such as in Thailand and Indonesia and will also add capacity at plants already running, for example at its Kentucky plant in the United States.After recovering from a damaging safety recall in 2010 and a huge earthquake in 2011 in Japan that disrupted supply chains, Toyota booked record group-wide sales of 9.7 million vehicles in 2012, beating General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG .Shares in Toyota have risen 37 percent since the beginning of 2013, outperforming the Nikkei index that has rose about 34 percent in the same period.Toyota released its results after the close of trade on Wednesday.On Wednesday, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, which makes Subaru cars, booked record annual operating profit of 120 billion yen for the year ended in March, more than double last year’s figure. The company also announced a plan to spend $400 million on expanding capacity in the United States, its biggest market.	-2.205513784

TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell on Wednesday as global tensions flared after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, but Toyota rose after releasing earnings and announcing a share buyback.The Nikkei ended down 0.4 percent at 22,408.88 points.Trump’s move raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies, which lifted shares of mining firm Inpex Corp by 1 percent.“The short-term impact on the stock market may be limited, but worries over a mid-to-long term impact could lead to a risk-off stance from investors,�� said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.“If oil prices stay high, costs will rise and that will trigger price increase.”Toyota Motor Corp, which released its full-year result during trading hours for the first time, soared 3.8 percent to a three-month high of 7,424 yen after it posted an operating profit of 2.4 trillion yen ($21.90 billion) in the year just ended, outpacing rivals Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG for the fifth straight year.Toyota forecast a 4.2 percent slide in operating profit to 2.3 trillion yen for the current year, hit by a stronger yen but still above market expectations.Toyota also said that it would buy back up to 55 million of its own shares, or 1.85 percent outstanding, worth up to 300 billion yen.Takeda Pharmaceutical fell 2.4 percent after it said on Tuesday it had agreed to buy London-listed Shire for ($62 billion), the biggest yet in a wave of deals sweeping the drugs industry.The pharmaceutical sector tumbled 2.8 percent and was the worst sectoral performer on the board, with traders citing passive investors�� selling.

TOKYO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Japanese shares hit 1-1/2-week lows on Thursday after profit-taking set in as doubts over an interim U.S.-China trade deal grew, while Line Corp and Z Holdings jumped on news the Yahoo Japan operator was in merger talks with messaging app firm Line.The Nikkei share average retreated 0.8% to 23,141.55, its lowest since Nov. 5, and the broader Topix dropped 0.9% to 1,684.40, also a 1-1/2-week low.Dashing upbeat expectations about a phase one deal was a Wall Street Journal report that said Sino-U.S. negotiations had “hit a snag�� over farm purchases, with Beijing not wanting a deal that looks one-sided in favour of the United States.Worries about violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong also soured investor sentiment.“The Nikkei had been making considerable gains over the past weeks. Level wise, it’s no wonder investors moved to lock in some profits today,�� said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at equity investment firm Libra Investments.In the cautious climate, the safe-haven yen firmed as high as 108.66 overnight and was last quoted at 108.72 against the dollar, weighing on Japanese exporters as a strong domestic currency hurts corporate profits when they are repatriated.Export-oriented Nissan Motor shed 3.5%, Honda Motor fell 2.2%, and Toyota Motor dropped 1.2%.Z Holdings, which last month changed its name from Yahoo Japan, soared 16.9% after the internet firm said merger discussions were underway with Line Corp.Shares in Line surged 15.4%, or its daily limit of 705 yen, while SoftBank Corp, which owns almost half of Z Holdings, climbed 1.9%.The merger talks between Z Holdings and Line also put pressure on their competitors, with Rakuten Inc diving 5.8%.Z Holdings was the most traded stock on the main board, while SoftBank Corp was the third-most traded issue.The information and telecom sector rose 0.3% to become the best performer among Tokyo’s 33 subsector indexes.Elsewhere, Recruit Holdings advanced 2.0% after the HR services provider reported its April-September net profit rose by 23.2% to 114.2 billion yen.

* Toyota, Honda gain market share in 2012* Toyota’s U.S. December sales up 9 pct, GM up 5 pct* GM, Ford shares rise to highest levels in 17 months* Economic uncertainty in 2013 may dampen salesBy Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales rose 9 percent in December, led by foreign manufacturers, capping off the best year for the industry since before the recession.The year’s sales were driven by a slowly recovering economy, more available credit and the need for consumers and businesses to replace aging cars and trucks.General Motors Co posted December U.S. sales growth of 5 percent compared with the year-earlier month, Ford Motor Co increased sales 2 percent and Chrysler Group LLC’s sales rose 10 percent.Wall Street cheered the results, sending GM and Ford stock to their highest levels since July 2011. GM shares ended 2.4 percent higher at $29.82 and Ford shares were up 2 percent to end at $13.46 on Thursday.Research and consulting firm Polk said it expects U.S. auto sales to hit 15.3 million vehicles in 2013. GM and Ford both predicted industry sales of more than 15 million vehicles, but Toyota Motor Corp offered a more modest forecast of 14.7 million vehicles.For the year just ended, U.S. auto sales rose 13.5 percent to nearly 14.5 million new vehicles, the best performance since 2007, according to Reuters calculations.In the decade prior to 2008 when the recession slowed the industry, U.S. auto sales averaged nearly 17 million vehicles a year.While last month’s auto sales showed little impact of jitters caused by the so-called fiscal cliff - which proved largely averted - automakers expressed worry over the fog of uncertainty still emanating from Washington.The impact of a payroll tax increase that took effect at the start of the year and the upcoming congressional debate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling may keep some consumers out of the market in 2013, several automakers said.“It would have been nice if all the open questions had been resolved in the ‘fiscal cliff�� discussion over the holiday, but clearly they weren’t, and that does extend this period of uncertainty from a consumer point of view,�� Jonathan Browning, head of Volkswagen AG’s American unit, told reporters on a conference call.A 2 percentage-point payroll tax increase will take about $1,000 from the average household budget, said Ford economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick.“It is something that we’re looking at very carefully, as it will crimp the consumer spending scene somewhat in the months ahead,�� said Hughes-Cromwick.Jesse Toprak, analyst with TrueCar.com, said the hit to households would be about the same amount as a down payment on a new vehicle.“The cheap financing and improved income will make up for that, but that’s something we’re going to have a keep an eye on,�� he said.Hughes-Cromwick said the tax increases for the wealthiest Americans will not greatly affect auto sales, because they tend to purchase new vehicles even if taxes change.Tom Libby, an analyst at Polk, said continued low interest rates along with an improved housing sector and new product offerings from major automakers will make 2013 a bullish year for the industry.Detroit’s automakers showed December U.S. sales gains of 5 percent, slightly better than analysts�� expectations, but not enough to stave off market-share gains by Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd.The two largest Japanese automakers in the U.S. market rebounded from poor showings in 2011 when their inventory was constrained after the Japan earthquake and tsunami.Toyota reported a 9 percent U.S. sales increase for December, which met analysts�� expectations. Honda’s December sales rose 26 percent but fell short of analysts�� expectations. Honda sales are up 24 percent on the year.Toyota’s 2012 U.S. sales rose about 27 percent, compared with gains of 3.7 percent for GM, 4.7 percent for Ford, and 21 percent for Chrysler.GM’s U.S. market share is now at its lowest level since at least 1960, and probably at a low not seen since 1930, according to industry journal Ward’s Auto.GM and Ford lost market share in 2012, dented by competition from Toyota and Honda which recovered from 2011 earthquake-related setbacks.GM’s 2012 market share fell to 17.9 percent from 19.6 percent in 2011. Its market share was 23.5 percent in 2007, before the recession. Ford’s 2012 market share fell to 15.5 percent from 16.8 percent in 2011.“We’re always concerned about market share - always,�� said Mark Reuss, GM chief in North America. “But we’re not going to give it away like we did in the past and burn the residuals and the brand values in anticipation of the biggest product portfolio launch that we’ve had in history.”Reuss referred to the years before GM’s 2009 bankruptcy and taxpayer bailout, when vehicle production outpaced demand and it layered on incentives to lower prices for consumers.The F-Series pickup truck from Ford, the top-selling vehicle in North America for more than three decades, had its best sales month in December since August 2007.The F-Series remained the best-selling vehicle in the United States, with annual sales of 645,316, followed again by the full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup, at 418,312.Most luxury brands had a good year. BMW for the second straight year edged German rival Mercedes-Benz for the U.S. sales crown, followed by Toyota’s Lexus and Honda’s Acura.The two U.S. luxury brands both saw sales fall in 2012, with Cadillac down 1.7 percent and Lincoln off 4.1 percent.Japanese models swept the next four places, with Toyota Camry leading the Honda Accord, Honda Civic and Nissan Altima. Chrysler’s Ram pickup placed seventh, followed by Toyota Corolla, Ford Escape and Ford Focus.Both GM and Ford went into the recession that began in late 2007 - and into 2008 when gasoline prices spiked - overladen with low-mileage big pickup trucks and SUVs.GM said on Thursday that in 2012 it sold in the U.S. market more than 1 million vehicles that get at least 30 miles per gallon in highway driving. And Ford said that in the year it sold the most small cars since 2001.Sales of high-profile hybrid and electric vehicles were a mixed bag in 2012. GM’s Chevrolet Volt tripled sales to 23,461, but still fell well short of the company’s original goal of 40,000 vehicles. Nissan’s Leaf was virtually flat, at 9,819.Toyota maintained its lead in the green-car category, with total Prius sales of 236,659, up 73 percent with the addition of three new Prius derivatives in the past year.Chrysler easily beat analysts�� expectations and had its 33rd consecutive month of year-on-year sales gains. Its annual sales rose 21 percent. Its market share in 2012 rose to 11.4 percent from 10.7 percent in 2011. Chrysler is majority-owned by Italian automaker Fiat SpA.Sales for South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Corp and Kia Motors Co rose 5 percent. Hyundai, the larger of the sister companies, reported full-year U.S. sales of 703,007 vehicles, a company record.Volkswagen reported a monthly increase of 31.5 percent for its namesake brand and luxury brands Audi and Porsche and a 30 percent gain for the full year.December sales fell 12 percent for Lincoln, Ford’s luxury brand.Aided heavily by consumer incentives that reduce the price of the vehicles, GM in December dramatically trimmed its inventory of full-size pickup trucks to 80 days of supply from 139 days at the end of November. Most automakers like to have about 80 days of supply of these pickup trucks.For the overall industry, the pace of annual sales increases has been in the double digits since the market bottomed in 2009, when it hit the worst annual sales rate since World War Two, adjusting for population.	0.5033901788
BEIJING, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two Chinese joint ventures sold about 104,700 vehicles in China in October, up 27.1 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Monday.That followed an 26.1 percent year-on-year jump in September and a 8.9 percent rise in August. In the first ten months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker by sales volume sold about 815,000 vehicles in China, up 11.3 percent from a year earlier.Toyota aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China this year. If accomplished, this would see the carmaker surpass annual sales of 1 million vehicles in China for the first time, a target it originally aimed for in 2010.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said on Wednesday it would expand its partnership with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (GAC Group) to areas such as ride-hailing operations and autonomous driving.China’s largest ride-hailing firm and Guangzhou-based GAC Group will work on fleet expansion and management, development of new mobility products, and collaboration on smart driving, including autonomous driving technology, Didi said in a statement.Didi has also invested in OnTime, a mobility platform newly-launched by GAC Group and will support the company with its data capabilities and operational expertise, it added.GAC Group was among 31 automakers and parts suppliers that formed an alliance with Didi last year. Didi said at the time that it wanted to offer its customer and operational skills to automakers wanting to develop their own ride-sharing services in return for design expertise.Didi has set up joint ventures with a unit of Chinese carmaker Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd and Germany’s Volkswagen as part of its goal to ultimately develop purpose-built cars for its services.GAC sold over 2.1 million cars last year, including units made with Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi.	6.517344546
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp on Monday said it would develop a heavy-duty fuel-cell truck with its subsidiary, Hino Motor Co, as it sees hydrogen technology as a zero-emissions alternative to battery power for large commercial vehicles.In a statement, Toyota said the truck, based on Hino’s Profia model, would be equipped with two fuel cell stacks developed for the next model of its Mirai fuel cell sedan. It would have a traveling range of 600 kilometers (373 miles).Toyota has long touted fuel cell vehicles as the ultimate “green car��, and sees the technology as more efficient than battery electric cars, embraced by many rivals as a zero-emissions alternative to gasoline vehicles.	9.297929793
(Reuters) - Double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso turned rookie for a day on Sunday when he tried out Toyota’s world endurance championship car in a test that could lead to a Le Mans 24 Hours entry next year.The 36-year-old McLaren driver completed 113 laps of the Bahrain International Circuit in the TS050 hybrid for a total distance of 611km.The end-of-season test came a day after Toyota won the Six Hours of Bahrain race at the track.“It was a great day. Testing an LMP1 (Le Mans top tier) car is always a nice thing for any racing driver because these cars are amazing to drive,�� Alonso said in a Toyota statement.“They are very consistent throughout a stint which is a positive thing. I have wanted to test a car like this for a long time now and today I could achieve that so I am happy,�� added the Spaniard.Alonso, who will be racing in Formula One’s Abu Dhabi season-ender next weekend, posted a best time of one minute 43.013 which compared to a 1:42.38 set by Toyota regular Mike Conway.The Spaniard had visited Toyota’s Cologne factory in Germany on Nov. 7 for a seat fitting and simulator session.McLaren are partnered by Honda, Toyota’s big domestic auto industry rivals, but that relationship will terminate at the end of this season -- leaving Alonso free to race for Toyota at Le Mans without contractual problems should he secure a drive.Le Mans in June does not clash with any Formula One commitments.Toyota have yet to confirm their continuation in the endurance championship, with champions Porsche pulling out, but are expected to stay as favorites to win Le Mans.Alonso, who competed in this year’s Indianapolis 500, has set his sights on completing the so-called Triple Crown of motorsport.The feat, only achieved by the late British driver Graham Hill, involves winning Indianapolis, The Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar car and the Formula One world championship.Some consider the Triple Crown to be the Monaco Grand Prix, rather than the world championship, but Alonso has won both.He will also compete in the Daytona 24 Hours race in Florida in January with the United Autosports team as part of his preparations.	2.687263658
TOKYO, June 29 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday said it was recalling 2.87 million vehicles worldwide over a possible fault with their evaporative fuel emissions control unit.The recall covers vehicles produced between April 2006 and August 2015, and includes the Japanese automaker’s gasoline hybrid Prius model, the Auris compact hatchback and Corolla compact models.Earlier in the day, the Japanese automaker said it was recalling 1.43 million Prius and Lexus models worldwide because of a separate issue involving a possible airbag inflator defect.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's Competition watchdog said on Wednesday it has fined Japanese car and truck tire maker Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Co 5105.T C$1.7 million for its alleged participation in an international bid-rigging conspiracy.The Competition Bureau said the bid-rigging conspiracy is tied to the supply of anti‑vibration components to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.The independent Canadian law enforcement agency that ensures businesses operate competitively said its investigation found that between June 2004 and August 2006, Toyo engaged in secret pacts with other suppliers of anti-vibration parts in response to requests for quotes issued by Toyota for certain Corolla, RAV 4 and Lexus models.Toyo Tire was not immediately reachable for comment.To date, the Bureau’s investigation involving motor vehicle components has resulted in some eight guilty pleas and over C$58 million in fines imposed by the courts since April 2013.The fine comes just a day after John Pecman, the head of the agency vowed that the Bureau would not go soft on cartel and bid-rigging cases, despite a couple of setbacks in some recent cases.Last month, Canadian prosecutors dropped proceedings against the local arm of Nestle NESN.VX in a multi-year investigation into alleged price-fixing of chocolate products.Canada had charged Nestle and others in 2013 with colluding to fix the price of chocolate. At the time, the Bureau recommended lenient treatment for the Canadian arm of Hershey Co, which cooperated with the investigation and reached a deal to plead guilty to a single count of price fixing.“Cracking down on cartels has been, and continues to be, a top priority for the Bureau,�� said Pecman in a speech at law firm Goodmans in Toronto on Tuesday.“We have had some setbacks. I won’t pretend otherwise. But a Chicken Little reaction that ��the sky is falling�� is a wholly inappropriate response,�� he said.	-8.07110257

"TOKYO (Reuters) - In Japan, trucks are being designed for a driverless future with no cabin and interchangeable container areas that would allow vehicles to be highly customized for parcel delivery or even serve as mini-hotels or beauty salons.At the Tokyo Motor Show this week, Hino Motors 7205.T, the truckmaking arm of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, showcased the futuristic ""Flatformer"", which had no driver's cabin and where the low-riding bed is fixed but the cargo or container section can be swapped out.On display was a concept battery-electric model with a cargo hold divvied up into stacked storage boxes that would help parcel delivery companies to sort, load and deliver goods more efficiently.“The idea is to produce a standardized truck bed upon which customers can customize according to the services they offer,�� said Atsuyuki Hanazawa, manager of the design division at Hino’s future projects group.Explosive growth in online shopping and increased demand for same-day deliveries have heaped pressure on courier companies and their drivers - particularly in Japan where the sector has borne the brunt of a worsening labor shortage.In 2016, video footage of a courier in Japan kicking and tossing parcels in apparent frustration due to overwork went viral, sparking widespread public criticism.Toyota’s minivehicle brand Daihatsu also showed off its “Tsumu Tsumu�� model with a removable cargo hold - one that can be adapted to suit the needs of farmers transporting vegetable harvests, or as a food truck, or for businesses that need to deliver food to restaurants.Such flexibility may be critical for the future of minitrucks in Japan, given that the number of farmers - a core customer base for Daihatsu’s no-frills, affordable vehicles - is dwindling as the country ages rapidly.“The needs of people who use minitrucks are changing, so we need to start thinking about products beyond what we’ve been offering and which enable multi-functionality,�� said Daihatsu designer Osamu Iwanami.While production versions of the Hino and Daihatsu models are likely years away, Toyota has also said it is developing production models of “e-Palette�� shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles that can be used, for instance, as mobile restaurants or offices."	3.035998265
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Saturday it had sold all shares in Tesla Inc TSLA.O by the end of 2016, having canceled its tie-up with the U.S. luxury automaker to jointly develop electric vehicles.Japan’s biggest automaker had bought around a 3 percent stake in the Palo Alto-based automaker for $50 million.Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said the company had sold all of its shares in Tesla as of the end of 2016, part of a regular, periodic review of its investments, after it had initially sold down a portion in 2014.“Our development partnership with Tesla ended a while ago, and since there has not been any new developments on that front, we decided it was time to sell the remaining stake,�� he said.In November, the Japanese automaker appointed its president to lead their newly-formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that it has been slow to embrace.The department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota’s strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company’s efforts to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations.	-1.605419451

Nov 10 (Reuters) - Sirius XM Holdings Inc cannot force owners of vehicles sold with trial subscriptions to its satellite radio service to arbitrate disputes, a federal appeals court decided on Monday, in a case involving alleged unsolicited sales calls.In reversing a lower court ruling, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said owners may try to pursue their claims as a group rather than in individual arbitrations, which can be costly and time-consuming.The panel found no showing that plaintiff Erik Knutson, a San Diego-area real estate broker, agreed to arbitrate disputes with Sirius when he bought his Toyota Tacoma truck in Nov. 2011.“A reasonable person in Knutson’s position could not be expected to understand that purchasing a vehicle from Toyota would simultaneously bind him to any contract with Sirius XM, let alone one that contained an arbitration provision without any notice of such terms,�� Circuit Judge Harry Pregerson wrote for the panel.A 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving AT&amp;T Inc made it easier for companies to require consumers to arbitrate disputes, but called arbitration “a matter of contract.”Patrick Reilly, a Sirius spokesman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Sirius has contracts with Toyota and several other automakers to install satellite radio receivers in new vehicles.Knutson accused New York-based Sirius of violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act by making three unauthorized calls to his cell phone in the 90-day trial subscription period after he bought his truck.Sirius countered that Knutson was bound by a “customer agreement�� containing the arbitration clause, and included in a “Welcome Kit�� sent a month after he bought his truck. Knutson said he never read or assented to the customer agreement.“The 9th Circuit, 100 percent got it right,�� said Abbas Kazerounian, a lawyer for Knutson, in a phone interview. “There was no meeting of the minds in the contract.”The 9th Circuit returned the case to U.S. District Judge Anthony Battaglia in San Diego for further proceedings.The case is Knutson et al v.

DETROIT, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling 261,114 Lexus and Toyota brand vehicles in the United States because various safety systems, including stability control and anti-lock brakes, could become inoperative.It is recalling vehicles from model years 2012 and 2013 because an electrical component in the brake actuator, which adjusts fluid pressure in each wheel cylinder, may experience increased resistance, according to documents filed with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.That could lead to reduced vehicle control and an increased risk of a crash as various safety systems, including traction control, become inoperative.Toyota officials could not immediately be reached to comment.The vehicles affected in the recall include 54,010 of the Lexus RX350 crossover vehicles and 100,052 of the Toyota Tacoma pickup trucks, both from model years 2012 and 2013, as well as 107,052 of the Toyota RAV4 SUVs from model year 2012, according to the NHTSA documents.Not all of the recalled vehicles were sold in the United States, according to the NHTSA documents.Toyota and Lexus dealers will update the software for the skid control electronic unit free of charge, according to the NHTSA documents.Earlier this week, Toyota recalled all 1.9 million of the third-generation Prius cars sold worldwide due to a programming glitch in their hybrid system.	-4.824561404

BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Increasing the use of hydrogen in power, transport, heat and industry could deliver around one fifth of the total carbon emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to safe levels by mid-century, a report by the Hydrogen Council said on Monday.To encourage industries to use hydrogen, Toyota and Air Liquide helped set up the Hydrogen Council, a global lobby launched in January this year.Its 27 members include automakers Audi, BMW, Daimler, Honda and Hyundai, and energy firms such as Shell and Total.The council said using hydrogen for transport, energy generation, energy storage, industry, heat and power could cut annual carbon emissions by 6 billion tonnes by 2050.“This would ... contribute roughly 20 percent of the additional abatement required to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius,�� the council said in a report released on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference in Bonn.To achieve a two-degree limit this century agreed by governments in Paris in 2015, the world must reduce energy-related carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2050.The report said one in 12 cars sold in California, Germany and Japan were expected to be powered by hydrogen by 2030.By 2050, hydrogen could power 400 million cars, 15 million to 20 million trucks, around 5 million buses, a quarter of passenger ships and a fifth of non-electrified train tracks, as well as some airplanes and freight ships.Achieving this shift in transport and other sectors would require investment of $280 billion by 2030, with about $110 billion to fund hydrogen output, $80 billion for storage, transport and distribution, and $70 billion to develop products.Fuel cell vehicles combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity to power an electric motor, producing water as a byproduct. However, making hydrogen from fossil fuels, a common route, also produces some greenhouse gas emissions.So far the take-up of hydrogen vehicles is tiny and industry experts say their wider use is years away, with high purchase prices and a lack of refueling stations the major barriers.But some firms, such as miner Anglo American and carmaker Toyota, are pushing for fuel cell cars to play a role even with the rise of battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs).Woong-chul Yang, vice chairman of automotive research and development at Hyundai said EVs and hydrogen fuel cell cars were needed because EVs were better for city driving and fuel cell vehicles better for longer journeys.Some countries have set targets for hydrogen use, such as China, which aims to have 1 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2030. Britain has a 23 million pound ($30 million) fund to accelerate the take-up of hydrogen vehicles.Some Chinese firms are interested in joining the Hydrogen Council, Pierre Etienne Franc, vice president of the hydrogen initiative at Air Liquide, told Reuters. “Most probably we will have a Chinese member in the next six months,�� he said.The council believes that, with the right policies, the investment needed was “feasible�� and the hydrogen market could see revenues of more than $2.5 trillion a year.	0.1041082726

WARSAW (Reuters) - An examiner was run over and killed by a 68-year-old woman taking her driving test in the southern Polish city of Rybnik on Monday, police said.The 35-year-old examiner was run over by the candidate at an examination center during the part of the test focusing on maneuvers, Rybnik police said in a statement on their website.“A 68-year-old woman, in circumstances which are unknown at the present time, hit the examiner, who unfortunately as a result of his injuries died at the scene,�� deputy police commissioner Ryszard Czepczor told news channel TVP Info.At the time of the accident, the examiner was probably testing another candidate, the police said.Footage from TVP Info showed the red Toyota Yaris involved in the accident with its front bumper and number plate hanging off as it was loaded on to a truck.“When we spoke to the woman she was in a state of shock and because of that speaking to her would be quite difficult,�� Czepczor said.	6.915194061
(Reuters) - World championship leader Thierry Neuville was flown to hospital for precautionary checks on Saturday after crashing out of the Rally of Chile.Hyundai said the Belgian, who escaped without injury, rolled his car repeatedly on the eighth stage of the penultimate day after drifting wide at the exit of a corner and hitting an earth bank.Neuville and co-driver Nicolas Gilsoul extracted themselves from the car without assistance and were attended to on the spot.“The high-speed nature of the crash will prevent the number 11 crew from continuing in Rally Chile for the rest of the weekend,�� Hyundai added.Neuville started the rally with a 10-point lead over reigning champion Sebastien Ogier after six rounds of the season, and was running in third place at the time of the crash.Ogier, a six-times world champion, was in second place for Citroen after stage nine with Estonian Ott Tanak leading for Toyota.	5.690850668
DETROIT - June 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday unveiled the new-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact car, a linchpin of its effort to attract new buyers to the brand and a symbol of the U.S. automaker’s competitive challenges.The 2016 Cruze, which goes on sale early next year, will be larger than its predecessor but about 250 pounds lighter. It will generate $1,500 more profit per car than the old model, GM estimated.Cool technology features are aimed at young buyers, including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to link smartphone screens to the car’s dashboard screen. GM sells the Cruze in 40 markets, including the United States, China, Brazil and India.The more high-tech Cruze is part of a broader product strategy that GM Chief Executive Mary Barra points to when making her case that GM can thrive without taking on a partner, such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.GM’s revamped compact sedan will drive into a crowd of competitors with similar performance, features and functionality in the same price range - about $16,000 to $26,000 in the United States.GM touted the 40 miles per gallon the car’s new four cylinder engine should deliver on the highway. This would match the fuel economy rating for Ford Motor Co’s competing Focus model on sale now.Sales of the current Cruze in the United States, Chevrolet’s largest market, lag those of the small car leaders, Toyota Motor Corp’s Corolla and Honda Motor Co Ltd’s Civic.Toyota has sold 159,486 Corollas in the United States through May 31 this year, while GM has sold 105,291 Cruzes. Many small and midsize sedans have taken a hit in the United States and China as consumers opt for sport utility vehicles.GM Executive Vice President Alan Batey, global head of the Chevrolet brand, said Wednesday one of his goals for the new Cruze is to rely less on sales to rental car fleets. While that would dent sales, the expected gain in resale values for the car would help it in the long term, he said.Batey said Chevrolet will not entirely abandon fleet sales for the Cruze, but going forward “somewhere between 15 to 20 percent is a pretty good number.”Chevy also plans to reduce sales to rental fleets of its redesigned midsize Malibu sedan due to be launched later this year.

* Five faults in parts ranging from steering to seats in 29 models* Toyota gives no cost estimate for recall* Recall is second largest by Toyota to date (Adds byline, detail and background on recent recalls)TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, in its second-largest recall announcement, said on Wednesday that it would call back 6.39 million vehicles globally after uncovering five different faults involving parts ranging from steering to seats.The world’s biggest automaker said it was not aware of any crashes or injuries caused by the glitches, which were found in 27 Toyota models including the RAV4 and Yaris subcompact.Toyota said faults were also found in the Pontiac Vibe and the Subaru Trezia, two models the automaker built for General Motors and Fuji Heavy Industries.The automaker did not say now much the recalls would cost, and it was not clear if the faults stemmed from Toyota’s suppliers or its manufacturing process.The move by Toyota to announce five different recalls on a single day from Tokyo comes as major automakers face increasing scrutiny in the United States on how quickly they take preventive safety action and how quickly they share information with regulators and the public.Toyota agreed last month to pay $1.2 billion to the U.S. government for withholding information related to unintended acceleration in its vehicles. That safety crisis had caused Toyota to recall more than 9 million vehicles.In a high-profile case that has the potential to change U.S. safety regulation, Toyota rival General Motors is under investigation for failing to act on a known ignition switch defect linked to a dozen deaths. The company has recalled 1.6 million vehicles over the issue.In the largest of the recalls announced on Wednesday, Toyota said some 3.5 million vehicles were being recalled to replace a spiral cable that could be damaged when the steering wheel is turned. That could cause the air bag to fail in the event of a crash, the automaker said.In total, about 2.34 million of the vehicles to be recalled were sold in North America. Another 810,000 were sold in Europe.In the second-largest of the Toyota recalls, some 2.32 million three-door models made between January 2005 and August 2010 are being recalled to check for a fault in the seat rails that could cause the seat to slide forward in a crash, risking injury for the driver or passengers.The other recalls are for faulty steering column brackets, windshield wiper motors and engine starters.The recall announcement, which came during late afternoon Tokyo trade, knocked an additional 2 percent off Toyota’s already sagging shares.They quickly pared the extra losses, however, and ended down 3 percent at 5,450 yen, reflecting an overall weak tone in the market where the benchmark Nikkei average fell 2.1 percent.Toyota’s 6.39 million vehicle recall is the largest announced on a single day for the company since October 2012, when it called back 7.43 million Yaris, Corolla and other models to fix faulty power window switches.In the first two months of 2014, major automakers had announced 18 separate recalls in the United States, now the second-largest auto market behind China, according to the latest data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The recent wave of large-scale recalls represents a source of revenue for auto dealers who are paid by manufacturers to service defective cars.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it will recall around 2.77 million vehicles worldwide, including certain models of the Prius, due to problems with the steering mechanism and the hybrid system water pump, its second multi-million car recall in two months.Toyota is recalling 1.5 million vehicles in Japan, 670,000 vehicles in the United States and 496,000 vehicles in Europe over a problem in the steering intermediate extension shafts, which could be damaged at slow speed, spokesman Joichi Tachikawa said on Wednesday.This problem, seen in cars such as the second-generation Prius and certain Corolla models can be fixed in about 50 minutes, he said.Separately, the Japanese carmaker is also recalling 630,000 vehicles worldwide, including 350,000 in the United States and 175,000 in Japan, to fix water pumps in hybrid vehicles, Tachikawa said.Some vehicles are target of both recalls, making the total number of vehicles to be recalled at 2.77 million, he said.Shares in Toyota were down 0.5 percent to 3,070 yen as of 2:44 p.m. (0544 GMT), slightly underperforming the main Nikkei that rose 0.1 percent.In October, Toyota said it was pulling back more than 7.4 million vehicles worldwide to fix faulty power window switches, the industry’s biggest single recall since Ford Motor Co took 8 million vehicles off the road in 1996.A series of Toyota recalls involving more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011 damaged the firm’s image, but it recovered and earlier this month raised its full-year net profit forecast to $9.7 billion, citing solid sales.Toyota has sold about 3.3 million Prius hybrid vehicles globally since the car went on sale in December 1997. The total number of hybrid vehicles it sold worldwide, including other models such as the Camry, was 4.6 million as of end-October.This year’s profit forecast comes despite a big drop in car sales in China since September, when anti-Japanese protests erupted over a diplomatic row.	12.44601492

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese telco SoftBank Corp 9434.T said on Monday its operating profit in the quarter ended June rose 4%, in line with estimates, as the number of mobile users grew.The company’s operating profit was 268.9 billion yen ($2.54 billion) in the first quarter, versus an average estimate of 268 billion yen from four analysts polled by Refinitiv.Its smartphone subscribers rose 372,000 from three months earlier as SoftBank markets a plan targeting heavy data users.The telco maintained its full-year operating profit forecast at 890 billion yen, up 9% from the previous year.SoftBank Corp has hiked its stake in Yahoo Japan Corp 4689.T and turned the internet company into a subsidiary to drive growth outside its wireless business.The Yahoo stake and its first ever share buyback announced last month have helped support SoftBank Corp’s shares, which debuted, and have languished, below their 1,500 yen IPO price.The stock closed down 0.5% ahead of the earnings. SoftBank Corp had Japan's largest ever listing in December as parent SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T refocuses on technology investing. The telco's outline for expansion includes a platform for autonomous driving that it has set up with Toyota Motor 7203.T and plans to export.Such ventures will require the high-speed, low-latency 5G services set to begin in Japan next year and that Chief Executive Ken Miyauchi says will drive growth at the telco and calm fears that the country’s market has hit maturity.($1 = 105.9100 yen)	2.961808262
BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N is poised to overtake its Japanese rivals on the top seller's list in China as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T struggle to regain market share following a flare up in anti-Japanese sentiment a year ago.For much of the past decade, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has languished some way behind Japanese brands and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS. And it has lagged a long way behind General Motors CoGM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in China.That’s mainly because of Ford’s late foray into China and the subsequent, conservative approach it has taken in an auto market that became the world’s biggest in 2009.Ford is fighting to change that picture and appears likely to sell more vehicles in China this year than two of its main Japanese rivals - Toyota and Honda. Its China sales are also zooming close to that of Nissan Motor Co 7201.T.Ford is likely to sell more than 900,000 vehicles, including passenger cars and commercial vehicles, in China this year thanks to its beefed-up product lineup, said a company official who spoke on condition of anonymity. New in the showroom since last year are a couple of small sport-utility vehicles and the redesigned Focus car.It has also just launched the redesigned Mondeo car, a China version of the car marketed in North America as the Fusion.The American automaker sold 551,738 vehicles during the first eight months of the year, up 50 percent. The company is expected to release its September China sales data as early as on Wednesday.“We should be able to sell more than 900,000 vehicles, possibly close to a million in China this year,�� the Ford official said.Toyota is targeting to sell about 900,000 vehicles and Honda about 750,000 in China this year. China-based spokespeople at the two firms said they were on track to meet those objectives.Nissan is aiming to sell 1.25 million vehicles, but a Nissan company executive speaking on condition of anonymity said last month the company was “stretching to achieve�� that goal.The Japanese carmakers have, however, recorded a sharp rise in year-on-year sales last month partly due to the low base from last September, when Japan’s decision to nationalize disputed islands in the East China Sea sparked anti-Japan sentiment among Chinese consumers.Ford and the Japanese carmakers are still no match for the likes of General Motors and Volkswagen.GM Group expects to sell more than 3 million vehicles in China this year. Its volume in China is forecast to grow 8 percent to 10 percent over last year, when the U.S. group sold a total of 2.84 million vehicles.According to consulting firm LMC Automotive, the Volkswagen Group is forecast to sell about 3.2 million vehicles this year in China, up from 2.8 million vehicles it sold in 2012.LMC says Hyundai Group’s sales in China this year should reach 1.64 million vehicles, up from 1.4 million last year.During the first nine months of this year, Toyota sold a total of about 636,700 vehicles, down 0.5 percent from a year earlier, Honda sold 497,261 vehicles, up 5.8 percent, and Nissan sold 885,700 vehicles, up 0.2 percent.Since Ford began an aggressive push to overhaul and beef up its product lineup for China over the past two years, “sales have been growing in leaps and bounds��, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight.That momentum should not only remain intact for the rest of this year but should become “even stronger�� next year and beyond, Zhang said, adding Ford expected to start production at a major assembly plant in the eastern city of Hangzhou around 2015.	-0.5621047701
BEIJING, April 1 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 90,400 automobiles in China in March, up 19 percent from a year earlier, the automaker said on Tuesday.That followed a 43.1 percent year-on-year jump in February and a 18.1 percent rise in January.In the first three months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker sold 227,900 vehicles, up 23.4 percent from a year earlier.Toyota this year aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China. If accomplished, the company would meet the objective to sell 1 million vehicles a year in China, which it had originally targetted for 2010.Last year, Toyota sold 917,500 vehicles in China.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group.

BANGKOK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Thailand’s investment agency has approved applications for projects worth 79.2 billion baht, or $2.4 billion, mainly in the automobile industry, it said on Tuesday.The world’s top car makers use Thailand as a regional base for vehicle production and exports.The approved projects include investment of about 10.4 billion baht on eco-cars, or fuel-efficient cars, by Toyota Motor, and an investment of 8.4 billion baht by Suzuki Motor, the Board of Investment (BOI) said in a statement.Honda’s Thai unit will invest about 8.2 billion baht, and a joint venture of China’s SAIC Motor Corp. and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group plans an investment of 7.6 billion baht for eco-car production, it added.Also approved were a 3.1-billion-baht production expansion plan by Nissan Motor, and an ethylene production project by PTT Global Chemical worth 9.8 billion baht, the agency said.The authorities have accelerated the approval process after delays caused by months of political unrest that prompted a military coup in May.

LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - British engineer GKN said on Friday it would invest over 12 million pounds ($18.8 million) to increase capacity at its Birmingham and Telford facilities in central England to support its role as a supplier to automotive brands.“The UK is proving itself to be a strong automotive performer with a high proportion of exports. The success of our customers and their demand for GKN technology has meant we are now investing to increase capacity,�� said GKN Chief Executive Nigel Stein.The group’s GKN Driveline plant in Birmingham supports UK-based automotive marques: Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Bentley and Lotus. In addition, the facility supplies firms such as Renault, Fiat and Volvo.Its GKN Land Systems plant in Telford is investing in new manufacturing equipment for the production of components for the new Range Rover Sport.Last month, GKN said first-half profit rose by a third, driven by strong growth at its automotive business on the back of robust luxury car sales.Shares in the firm closed on Thursday at 216 pence, valuing the business at 3.5 billion pounds.	0.245428887
DETROIT/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators said Takata Corp’s response to an order to expand a recall nationwide was “disappointing��, critising the Japanese auto parts supplier for shirking responsibility over its potentially deadly air bags.Takata, at the centre of a global recall of more than 16 million cars in the past six years, had until Tuesday to respond to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) order to expand a regional recall and replace driver-side air bags from across the United States.Takata has not made its response to NHTSA public, but a spokeswoman in Tokyo said the contents echoed a statement by the company’s chief executive on Tuesday. In that statement, Shigehisa Takada left the decision for a nationwide recall up to automakers, and made no mention of whether Takata was admitting that its air bag inflators were defective, as ordered by NHTSA last week.“Takata shares responsibility for keeping drivers safe, and we believe anything short of a national recall does not live up to that responsibility,�� NHTSA said in an email to Reuters. The regulator said it would review Takata’s response to determine its next steps.In ordering a nationwide recall last week, NHTSA said it could begin steps to fine Takata up to $7,000 per vehicle not recalled, as well as force a recall. The maximum penalty under current law is $35 million.At least five deaths have been linked to Takata inflators, which can explode with excessive force and shoot shrapnel inside cars. Takata faces a criminal probe, more than 20 class action lawsuits, and congressional scrutiny over its inflators. The company supplies around a fifth of the world’s air bags.Japanese government officials have expressed concern that Takata’s repeated recalls could dent the reputation of the country’s auto industry. One official, who asked not to be named, said it would be “disastrous�� for Takata not to comply with NHTSA’s demand.“MUST DO MORE”In his statement released on Tuesday in the United States, Takada outlined steps aimed at demonstrating Takata’s commitment to safety, including forming an independent panel to audit its manufacturing procedures.Takata has recruited three former U.S. transportation secretaries to help it navigate the growing crisis.Samuel K. Skinner, a former White House Chief of Staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary, will lead an independent quality panel, while Rodney Slater and Norman Mineta will advise Takata.A report by the panel headed by Skinner on Takata’s manufacturing processes will be made public, Takada said.He said Takata would take “dramatic actions�� to increase output of replacement air bag inflator kits, including working with rivals and examining whether their products can be used safely. “I know we can and must do more,�� he said.Takata’s announcement comes ahead of a second congressional hearing on Wednesday that will likely focus on Takata’s response to NHTSA’s order.Hiroshi Shimizu, Takata’s senior vice president for global quality assurance, said in prepared remarks that a phased-in recall should give priority to U.S. regions with higher humidity - believed to be a factor in some air bag ruptures.Honda North America Executive Vice President Rick Schostek said in his testimony that a national recall would lead to parts shortages, but the Japanese automaker was “seriously considering�� it for driver-side air bag inflators.Toyota North America Vice President Abbas Saadat said in his testimony that the automaker wanted “additional assurances about the integrity and quality of Takata’s manufacturing processes.”Toyota and Honda called on Tuesday for independent industry-wide tests of Takata air bag inflators subject to recalls.

(Repeats story sent late Wednesday)* Biggest approved project was for Toyota Motor* Another involves China’s SAIC and Thailand’s CP* Junta leader Gen. Prayuth chaired investment board meetingBANGKOK, June 18 (Reuters) - Thailand’s investment agency said on Wednesday it approved applications for 18 projects worth about 120 billion baht ($3.7 billion), mainly in the auto industry, at its first board meeting after the May 22 military coup.The largest approval was for Toyota Motor Corp., which plans to spend 51.5 billion baht for production of pickup trucks and parts, the Board of Investment (BOI) said in a statement.Wednesday’s meeting was chaired by the junta’s leader, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha.Also approved were a tyre production project worth 18.9 billion baht by LLIT (Thailand) and production of coated steel sheets worth 10 billion baht by Posco Coated Steel (Thailand), the BOI said.Another approved plan was for investment of 9.2 billion baht by a joint venture of SAIC Motor Corp. of China and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group, for car production.Thailand is a regional vehicle production and export base for the world’s top car manufacturers. Domestic auto sales in Thailand tumbled 38 percent in May from a year earlier, the Federation of Thai Industries said on Wednesday.One approved plan, from Luxemburg’s Supernap International SA’s, is for a 6.9 billion baht investment in a data centre.The projects endorsed on Wednesday are among big applications awaiting approval. The military government said early this month that backlogged applications for local and foreign investors to invest more than $21 billion would be acted on within two months.The army seized power in a bid to restore order and business confidence after months of political unrest hurt consumption and investment.The total value of investment applications fell 42 percent to 308 billion baht in the first five months of this year from a year earlier. Within that, foreign investment requests dropped 10 percent to 230 billion baht.The junta has announced measures it hopes will get the sputtering economy going again. It is seeking to fast-track infrastructure spending, which has been derailed by the political crisis.On Wednesday, Thailand’s central bank cut this year’s growth forecast nearly by half to 1.5 percent but it saw a much brighter 2015 as the military government tries to reinvigorate the economy.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a broad coalition of Japanese, German and South Korean automakers warned on Friday that renewed punitive Chinese tariffs on U.S. autos would hurt U.S. vehicle exports to China and put U.S. jobs at risk.“The tit-for-tat tariffs, absent any meaningful negotiations, are damaging to the American auto industry,"" John Bozzella, who chairs the ad-hoc group ""Here for America"" that includes Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and BMW AG BMWG.DE, said in a statement.""When these tariffs were initially imposed by China in 2017, American exports of finished vehicles dropped by 50 percent.��We can’t let that happen to American workers again,"" added Bozzella, who also is chief executive of the Association of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Hyundai Motor 005380.KS, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and other foreign-owned brands building vehicles in the United States.China imported 190,118 U.S.-made vehicles in 2018, down by 35% from a year earlier, according to data from country’s top auto importer Sinomach Auto, citing trade tension and tariff adjustment.Ford Motor Co F.N, a net auto exporter to China, said Friday in a statement it encouraged ""the U.S. and China to find a near-term resolution on remaining issues through continued negotiations.

* Toyota turns negative after it cuts annual net profit outlook* Market little moved from State of the Union address* Shiseido soars after Estée Lauder’s brisk quarterly results* Sega Sammy dives after expecting annual net lossTOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei edged up on Wednesday with markets barely reacting to U.S. President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, while attention remained on corporate earnings.Toyota Motor Corp slipped into negative territory after the automaker cut its annual net profit outlook during afternoon trade. The stock ended 0.7 percent lower.The Nikkei share average rose 0.1 percent to 20,874.06.In an 82-minute speech that began at 0200 GMT, Trump said he wanted a U.S. immigration system that was “safe, lawful, modern and secure�� as he continued to seek funding for a border wall rejected by Democrats.The market had focused on whether there would be specific comments on U.S.-China trade deals. From China to Venezuela to Afghanistan, Trump devoted a large section of his speech to foreign policy, saying a trade deal was possible with China if Beijing agrees to “real structural change.”�Since his reference to the trade dispute lacked details, investors found it difficult to take positions,�� said Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “They traded passively as they wanted to see how U.S. shares will react to the speech later in the day.Shiseido Co, Japan’s biggest cosmetics maker, surged 4.6 percent and added a hefty 11 positive points to the Nikkei, after cosmetics maker Estée Lauder Cos Inc reported strong quarterly results, driven by robust growth in China.Since Shiseido has a big exposure to the Chinese market, the U.S. cosmetics maker’s earnings bode well for Shiseido, traders said. Other cosmetics makers followed suit, with Kose soaring 3.5 percent and Fancl Corp gaining 2.4 percent.On the other hand, NTT Data stumbled 9.2 percent and took off 22 points from the Nikkei after it said it would launch a tender offer for Netyear Group for 850 yen per share.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese government employee Jin Yang returned to work in Beijing this week to find his usual workplace rules upended as China battles a coronavirus epidemic.His office has banned the practice of eating lunch in its canteen with colleagues, in favor of boxed meals, packaged in house and eaten at desks, he said.“It’s anything but normal,�� the 28-year-old told Reuters.Meetings are held online, instead of in person. Employees must wear masks all day and report their temperatures twice a day.Jin is one of millions of workers who began streaming back this week from Lunar New Year holidays extended by 10 days in China’s struggle to rein in the virus, which has killed 1,380 people and infected nearly 64,000.But streets and subways are largely deserted in major cities such as Beijing, the capital, and the business hub of Shanghai, with many shops and restaurants empty or shut, while lots of office employees work from home.As many places still enforce containment measures, companies are adopting rules to prevent infection and banish employees�� fears of catching it, such as keeping them as widely separated as possible.Not all companies have resumed work. Many that have are asking employees returning from trips overseas or other provinces to quarantine themselves at home for up to 14 days.A manager at one foreign multinational said staff were concerned, particularly after China’s tough step in locking down Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the outbreak began.“They want no contact,�� said the manager, who sought anonymity as she was not authorized to speak to media.“Some want people to sit with empty chairs between them at meetings, toilet visits to be assigned at staggered times, and no sharing of the water dispenser,�� she added, listing the precautions staff want followed.Chinese media have posted photographs of office canteens where plastic sheets and wooden boards divide up tables to form segregated dining cubicles.An industrial zone in the central city of Changsha has started using unmanned robots to deliver meals, the state-run People’s Daily newspaper said.Automaker GAC 601238.SS, which has joint ventures with Toyota 7203.T and Honda 7267.T, said no more than half its employees are allowed to work each day at its headquarters in the southern city of Guangzhou, with lunchtimes divided into four slots of 15 minutes each.It also rearranged its canteen, and shifted tables to an outdoor terrace, with each spaced 2 meters (7 ft) apart. It has also swapped its previous buffet service for a menu of pre-arranged options.E-commerce firm Pinduoduo PDD.O said its employees must complete a daily health-check form. It disinfects offices at least twice a day, and provides meals for everyone to minimize exposure.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The roots of Toyota Motor Corp’s China troubles run far deeper than the anti-Japan protests that have swept the country, stretching back to the 2008 launch of the Yaris subcompact -- a spectacular flop with price-conscious Chinese buyers.The car, a success elsewhere, was meant to help build brand loyalty and send Toyota hurtling towards a still-unattained goal of selling one million vehicles annually in the world’s largest auto market.However the Yaris missed the mark with China’s traditional higher-end customers as well as its new emerging middle class.To some company insiders and dealers it epitomizes all that does not appeal to the status-conscious, lacking what the Chinese call ‘daqi�� or ‘road presence��. Next to Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s pricier Tiida, for example, it feels small and lacks oomph.But for frugal first-time buyers, the Yaris which is priced from 87,000 yuan ($13,900) was a non-starter, costing some 55 percent more than General Motor’s Chevy Sail and putting Toyota at a competitive disadvantage in a must-win market.“The Yaris is too expensive, way too sleek for its target market. This group of consumers is very, very price sensitive,�� said an operator of a few dozen Toyota dealerships across China.Toyota sold an average of just 1,250 Yaris cars a month in China in 2012 data through August, before the territorial row between Japan and China flared up in September. By contrast, Nissan sold 12,000 Tiida subcompacts per month and GM moved 17,000 Chevy Sails.The Yaris shows how Toyota misread the evolution of China’s auto market. Surprised by how quickly the emerging middle class grew rich enough to buy cars, the automaker failed to grasp that the vast majority of those new buyers preferred no-frills models.Even now, with a new entry-level vehicle for China on the way, company insiders and dealers are not sure if Toyota has learnt enough from a valuable lesson about the importance of localizing.The misstep in China is a black eye for Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda, the founding-family scion who used to run the automaker’s China operations, and who also has had to deal with a major recall scandal and last year’s Japan quake and tsunami that paralyzed parts production.Back in 2003, he and his lieutenants set the “aspirational�� goal of selling one million cars annually by 2010 or taking 10 percent of the China market, said a senior China-based Toyota executive, who did not want to be identified because he was discussing non-public information.The automaker will again likely fail to sell one million units this year and Toyota officials have laid the blame squarely on the territorial row that halved September sales.Its longer-term pledge to boost sales to 1.8 million cars a year by 2015 also looks like a stretch. Toyota and its local Chinese partners sold 883,400 vehicles in China last year.But some Toyota dealers lament what could have been, if the automaker had had an entry-level model that sold as many as 100,000 vehicles a year as initially envisioned for the Yaris.“If they had executed their small car planning right, Toyota could have easily hit that 1 million unit sales milestone or 10 percent market share objective several years ago,�� said a major operator of Toyota dealerships who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of his comments.Toyota spokesman Akihiro Yamamoto declined to comment on the dealer’s view, saying only that the company should “continue to strive to provide products that satisfy and appeal to more Chinese consumers.”Toyota’s fix for the Yaris problem is a new, affordable minicar that it has developed specifically for China. Toyota sources told Reuters that the car is loosely based on the no-frills Etios, which sells for as low as $8,350 in India and is expected to hit showrooms in China as early as next year.The Japanese automaker is adding a few upgrades to appeal to Chinese consumers, taking the price tag closer to $10,000, according to the Toyota sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.That would make it more competitive with GM’s Chevy Sail, which costs about 56,000 yuan ($9,000) and well below the Nissan Tiida, which starts at about 100,000 yuan ($16,000).To succeed, it must not repeat the mistakes of the Yaris and some insiders say that at the core of Toyota’s China problem is a failure to localise that has its roots in Japan-centric thinking.“Our way of beefing up operations in China is to bring in more people from Japan,�� says a top Toyota executive critical of his own company’s China strategy, who also declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. “We should be localizing our business here, promoting Chinese managers, and listening more attentively to Chinese consumers. But we don’t.”Toyota’s Yamamoto said it is a stretch to associate the Yaris�� slower-than-expected sales with the degree of localization of the company’s operations in China. “We’re promoting more local Chinese employees to management ranks and will continue to do so in the future,�� he said.But when looking to add to the ageing Vios model in the mid-2000s, Toyota’s Japan-based product planners ignored the advice of sales executives in China to use an affordable car under development that had been designed for emerging markets.The planners thought the car was too shabby for Chinese buyers and decided to introduce it in India instead. That car later became the Etios.Nor did Toyota seek help from its minicar affiliate Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd, believing Daihatsu cars were not upscale enough.It also felt no immediate need to come up with a low-cost China car designed from the ground up. Instead, several top executives pushed the Yaris because it was one of the few lower priced left-hand-drive small cars available and it had a global supply base for parts that could be used in China.Toyota spokesman Yamamoto declined to elaborate on the new low-cost model, but pointed to a concept car the company showed earlier this year for hints. The car, called Dear Qin, was styled to woo China’s entry-level consumers, especially first-time buyers in their 20s and early 30s.Masaki Taketani, director of research firm IHS Automotive, said Toyota managed to upgrade the bare-bones Etios and keep it affordable by using a new, low-cost platform called Entry Family Compact. The platform meshes a bit of new technology with lower-cost underpinnings from an older, retired small car model, according to IHS.Toyota is likely to launch a sedan version of the new low-cost car in China in September and a hatchback in December 2013, he said.Toyota and its component suppliers have told IHS researchers they are counting on the new sedan and hatchback to generate combined annual sales of up to 250,000, but IHS is not that optimistic.Toyota would be lucky if it were able to sell 100,000 cars combined given the intense competition in the low-cost small car segment, Taketani says.“Gradually, Toyota is getting around to filling the gap in its low-cost small car line-up in China,�� he said. “But it’s still doubtful that the new car’s going to be a runaway success like GM’s Sail and Nissan’s Tiida.�� ($1 = 6.2503 Chinese yuan)	9.861882019
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia plans a series of incentives to boost production of electric vehicles (EVs), according to a copy of a draft regulation reviewed by Reuters.Southeast Asia’s largest economy wants EV manufacturers and battery makers to create a downstream industry for its supplies of nickel laterite ore, which is used in lithium batteries.Aiming to become a hub for Asia and beyond, Indonesia hopes companies will start EV production in 2022 and for the share of EV output to reach 20% of total car production by 2025.The draft regulation, which needs the president’s approval, includes incentives for manufacturers of EVs, infrastructure providers and transportation companies, as well as EV buyers.Details in the draft were confirmed by a government source with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media.In the draft, carmakers can get a reduction in import tariffs for knocked down - or unassembled - and semi knocked down cars for a certain period, as well as lower import tariffs for machinery and materials for production.However, they must prioritize locally sourced components. Carmakers will have to increase the composition of domestic components to 80% by 2030, while motorcycle makers will have to reach that target by 2026, according to the government source.Car owners may get benefits such as lower luxury taxes on purchases, lower annual vehicle tax rates, subsidized fees at charging stations, as well as non fiscal incentives like special parking areas and special lanes, the draft showed.In March, during a consultation with parliament, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati presented a new luxury tax scheme designed to encourage production of greener cars. The plan includes removing luxury tax completely for EVs and a low rate for hybrid cars.Indonesian authorities said Toyota Motor Corp, which has the biggest market share in the domestic car market, and Hyundai Motor would invest $2 billion and $880 million in the country, respectively, to develop EVs over the next few years.Japan’s Softbank Group would also study opportunities in investment in EVs, batteries and charging systems in Indonesia, its chief executive Masayoshi Son said last month.	2.031795269
May 18 (IFR) - Toyota set its own low-coupon record this week with a $1bn 1.75% five-year bond, but the big new issue concession seemed to show that for now, the ball is in the buy-side’s court.The order book for the Aa3/AA- rated company’s offer was only $1.3bn, and the new issue concession (NIC) appeared to leave the market as a whole concerned about NICs going forward.Liquid enough -- but not quite as liquid as a name like GE that could get slammed on headline risk -- the deal from Toyota launched on the back of good earnings results.The five-year maturity seemed to be a good choice, with investors definitely gravitating to shorter paper during the recent round of volatility.Toyota was able to print one of the top five lowest-ever five-year coupons for a financial institutions group (FIG) name.But it required 25bp-30bp in NIC, leaving the rest of the high-grade market to re-calculate the concessions for other names on their calendars.“We’ve had a lot of conversations recently about starting conservative and pushing tighter once we get the book,�� said one syndicate source active this week but not on the Toyota trade.“That second part is not happening right now,�� the source said.“With Treasury yields where they are, most issuers have been okay with their levels, but it feels like there is really no such thing as too cheap in this market.

"NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T executives have sometimes seemed to share the personality of the automaker's best-selling cars - dependable and efficient, but also a bit boring and bland.That’s changing. In recent months, Toyota founding family scion and President Akio Toyoda has emerged from the bureaucratic shadows to present himself as the company’s car-loving, fashion-forward salesman-in-chief.The marketing campaign aides have built around Toyoda is an unconventional move for a Japanese corporate icon where team play is prized above outsized personalities.In recent weeks, Toyoda has donned a race suit to drive the Lexus LFA super car at the 24-hour race in Germany’s Nuerburgring circuit and turned up at a Lexus party in New York with a hipster bow-tie and retro glasses.Meanwhile his assistants have kept a steady newsfeed on the “Toyota President’s Office�� Facebook page, which Toyoda was inspired to set up by the popularity of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s page.“I am at the top of Toyota and drive cars myself,�� Toyoda told reporters at an event in May when discussing the role he can play in to promote and develop the Lexus brand, which he has been directly overseeing since April. “I was also born with this name.”Toyota, which marked its 75th anniversary last year, for decades let its product speak for itself by building value-priced cars with bulletproof quality.In an industry with more than its fair share of celebrity CEOs comfortable with the limelight, such as Chrysler's Lee Iacocca and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Renault SA's RENA.PA Carlos Ghosn, at Toyota the real star has always been the ""Toyota Way"" -- the production and management philosophy passed down from one generation to next from founder Kiichiro Toyoda.But as rivals from General Motors Co GM.N to Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS to Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE have narrowed the quality gap, the Japanese automaker has been forced to respond.In a J.D. Power &amp; Associates survey of initial quality released in June -- the benchmark for the industry -- General Motors finished ahead of Toyota, highlighting the increased challenge for the one-time quality king.To push back, Toyota has been trying to make its cars more stylish. To shake up its slow decision-making process, it has split the carmaker’s operations into four business teams and named non-Japanese to head regional operations in some areas.It is also trying to bring a new edginess to its brand image and design. That strategy has put the spotlight on the 57-year-old Toyoda, according to people involved in the effort.It marks an unlikely, mid-career emergence for Toyoda, the grandson of the company’s founder, who just a few years ago was blogging under a pseudonym.“One of the main things he is doing is giving Toyota, the company, a personality,�� said Julie Hamp, Toyota Motor North America’s Group Vice President in charge of communications.“He knows that Toyota needs a story and products to fire the emotions and to ground our identity in new realities today, which is a more competitive environment.”Toyota declined to make Toyoda available for an interview. He and six executive vice presidents are set to speak to the media on Monday.What pushed Toyoda to embrace a radical corporate image makeover was a series of recall crises that hit the automaker in 2009, a senior Toyota executive said. Toyota recalled millions of vehicles globally because of problems including a glitch in the accelerator and floormat design.The company’s response to the crisis was slow and, most damagingly, Toyoda failed to speak up for the company. After weeks out of the spotlight, Toyoda, who had only been in the top job for eight months, called a news conference in Nagoya to apologize, but struggled to provide an English soundbite.When Toyoda was grilled by a U.S. congressional committee in February 2010, the experience was scarring, people knowledgeable about his thinking have said. It left him convinced the company had to change its approach to communication.Until then, Toyoda had seemed uncomfortable with reporters, only lighting up when talking about his great grandfather’s loom design or the principles of Toyota’s quality control, and he remained reluctant to put himself in the spotlight.To give him a nudge, the senior Toyota executive said, Toyota designers prepared a kind of mock fashion magazine for their boss, featuring scenes with stylishly dressed male models all with Toyoda’s head superimposed on the image.The idea was that Toyoda could be the star salesman if he could represent the brand and improve its image with edgy fashion at certain events.Toyoda first balked at the idea, but has since warmed to the role. In April, he took stage with a new look -- retro glasses, hip bowtie -- at the design-themed event for the luxury Lexus brand held in New York.“The image of Toyota might have been that it is massive and hard to approach, especially those executives at the top who run the company - they are out of reach, above the clouds,�� the senior executive said. “That might have been the case in the past, but now that’s no longer true.��"	-0.9104210697
BEIJING, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is likely to miss its 2014 objective of selling over 1.1 million vehicles in China because of a faster-than-anticipated economic slowdown and resulting price war in the local auto market.Toyota and its two Chinese joint ventures will miss the goal and will sell slightly more than 1 million vehicles in 2015, two company executives told Reuters. Researcher IHS Automotive puts sales at 1.09 million in 2014 and 1.15 million in 2015.The shortcoming reveals continued difficulty for Japanese automakers in China even as diplomatic relations recover from a territorial spat that turned Chinese consumers against Japanese goods. Compounding matters is an increase in models from premium German brands priced within reach of mainstream Japanese cars.“Toyota can resort to a fire sale and meet our sales targets, but our philosophy is to produce and sell as many as a market wants, not much more,�� said one of the executives. “We try to stay away from price wars as much as we can.”The Japanese automaker has unofficially aimed for 1 million vehicles in China since 2010, coming close with 917,500 vehicles in 2013.But with economic growth nearing its slowest rate in 24 years, Toyota has had to revise sales plans gradually since the third quarter, said the executives, who were not authorised to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.Projected 2014 sales for the automaker’s luxury brand Lexus, for example, are now roughly 75,000 cars from an original target of 85,000, they said. Toyota is scheduled to release full-year figures on Jan. 6.Another reason for slower-than-planned sales at Toyota - as well as at compatriots Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Honda Motor Co Ltd - is competition from premium German brands such as BMW, said one of the Toyota executives.Dealers of those brands have tried to meet planned growth rates by heavily discounting cars at the lower end of product line-ups, making prices comparable to non-premium Japanese cars.For instance, BMW’s 3-Series starts at about 283,000 yuan while the most expensive version of Toyota’s Camry mid-sized sedan costs 275,000 yuan.“When the BMW 3-Series is given a 10 percent or more discount, it really squeezes sales of the Camry and similarly priced cars in our line-up,�� said one of the Toyota executives.A BMW spokesman declined to comment.Toyota sold about 907,400 vehicles in China in January-November, up 12.2 percent, aided by several redesigned models including the high-volume Corolla compact, as well as the China launch of the Vios and Yaris subcompacts.A relative dearth of redesigned models for 2015 will leave growth in the new year more or less on par with that of the overall market, the two executives said. IHS sees the market growing 7.1 percent to 24.9 million vehicles.There may only be one significant redesign of a mainstream Toyota-brand model, said one of the executives, namely the Crown sedan which is “not a huge volume generator.�� (Editing by Christopher Cushing)	4.955920896
JAKARTA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - At a thronging auto show on Jakarta’s outskirts, the man in charge of selling Hondas to Indonesian drivers is buoyant: consumers are shopping for cars again, breathing life back into southeast Asia’s largest market after two bruising years.Honda, boosted by its popular minivans and a string of new models, is among the top potential gainers, overtaking rival Daihatsu, a Toyota subsidiary, for the first time in more than a decade.Automobile sales rose for a fourth month in July, rising 12.5 percent from the same month a year earlier, following 20 months of declining sales.Daya Hansten, marketing boss for Honda’s top dealer, credits Honda’s popular minivans and attractive finance deals - but he is not alone in his confidence: 25 car brands at this gathering showed off 33 new designs. Daihatsu’s local subsidiary launched a new minivan, the Sigra, earlier this month.“Competition in the second half will be tighter, especially with so many new products by our competitors,�� Hansten said.“But the upward trend in sales should strengthen in the second semester (half year), and that makes us more confident.”After five years of a broad slowdown across the economy, Indonesia accelerated faster than expected in the second quarter as consumers began spending more.Indonesia surprised with its strongest growth in 10 quarters in April-June, spurring some economists to predict it will outperform most Southeast Asian nations the rest of this year.Car sales are seen as a good indicator of Indonesians�� readiness to spend. Growth in car sales turned positive in April and they have climbed since, sparking hopes the industry’s sales target of 1.06 million units - 5 percent higher than in 2015 - could be topped.Honda, which has bet on the minivan segment that accounts for almost a third of the market, increased sales 34 percent in the first half of this year versus the same period in 2015, far outpacing market leader Toyota growth and compared to the industry’s pace of 1.2 percent.Its market share was 20.6 percent in the first half, up from 7.4 percent in 2013. Toyota and Daihatsu remained stable at around 50 percent.“Our sales outlook is positive,�� said Jonfis Fandy, marketing director of Honda’s local unit PT Honda Prospect Motor, noting a potential boost for the second half from lower interest rates.PT Toyota Astra Motor and PT Astra Daihatsu Motor, joint ventures between Toyota and conglomerate PT Astra International Tbk, have also launched several new models, cranking up competition already so intense that Ford Motor Co pulled out earlier this year.“The market became full with so many players. Sales of our Xenia were eroded,�� said Amelia Tjandra, marketing director of PT Astra Daihatsu Motor, betting on the cheaper Sigra minivan as well as its best-selling Xenia.For Denny Triswijadi, who bought a new Honda at the car show on Saturday to replace his Toyota, it’s a matter of looking at something new. “I just want to try this car. This looks like its more comfortable,�� he said.	-3.833892617
KITAKYUSHU, Japan, April 6 (Reuters) - Japanese mini-vehicle maker Daihatsu Motor Co on Wednesday said that it planned to expand its presence in automobile markets in emerging countries, although it had yet to decide which market to enter next.“We are in Indonesia and Malaysia at the moment, but we haven’t made a decision on which country we’d like to enter next,�� President Masanori Mitsui told reporters during a visit to one of the company’s plants in southern Japan.“This is something we will decide with Toyota ... given our expertise, it will likely be an emerging market.”Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s largest automaker, in January announced it would buy out the shares in Daihatsu it didn’t already own in a deal worth about $3 billion which is aimed to strengthen its push into compact cars for emerging markets.

Oct 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling about 803,000 sedans, mostly its Camry, in the United States from the model years 2012 and 2013 due to potential problems with air conditioning condensers, the company said on Thursday.Globally, the recall involves about 885,000 Camry, Avalon and Venza sedans, including 44,000 in Canada, 10,600 in Mexico, 9,100 in Saudi Arabia and the rest scattered among 15 countries.Water from the condenser can leak onto the airbag control module, which could cause the airbag to inflate and deploy at the wrong time, Toyota said. Also, power steering may be affected by a leaky condenser.Toyota said the issue has led to two “minor�� injuries and no accidents.	-1.443792464
(Reuters) - Automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Hyundai Motor 005380.KS, on Tuesday reported a sharp drop in September U.S. sales, hurt by the early timing of Labor Day as sales from the holiday weekend were booked in August.The Labor Day weekend is one of the busiest car-buying periods in the United States that has automakers and dealers roll out promotions days in advance to boost sales.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it U.S. sales fell 16.5% to 169,656 vehicles in September, hurt by lower sales of its Highlander and Tacoma sport utility vehicles, as well as declining demand for sedans such as Camry and Prius.Hyundai Motor's 005380.KS U.S. sales tumbled 9% to 51,951 automobiles last month, due to lower volumes of its Elantra and Sonata sedans, while Nissan's U.S. sales plunged 17.6% to 101,244 vehicles on lower sales of its Sentra sedan and Rogue SUV.U.S. automakers are focusing on selling larger SUVs and trucks that are more profitable.While higher vehicle prices and rising interest rates earlier in the year kept car shoppers on the sidelines, analysts expect recent cuts in interest rates to boost car sales in the third quarter.The average interest rate on a finance deal fell to 5.5% in the latest quarter, more than 60 basis points lower than the first quarter, according to auto consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.In the third quarter, sales in the United States slipped 1.2% to 627,194 vehicles for Toyota, rose 5% to 173,028 vehicles for Hyundai and fell 5% to 327,354 vehicles for Nissan.U.S. car shopping website Edmunds has forecast third-quarter sales for the industry to rise by 0.8% to 4.3 million vehicles, led by volume gains at General Motors Co GM.N.

* Automakers stage rally* OPEC meeting, Italy’s referendum could trigger profit-taking - analystTOKYO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose for a sixth day on Thursday as prospects of exporters�� earnings improved after the dollar jumped against the yen, helping such stocks as Toyota and Honda.Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday on Wednesday, and investors returned to the market on Thursday to see that the dollar rose as high as 112.98 yen on Wednesday, its loftiest peak since March. The dollar was bolstered by upbeat U.S. economic reports that raised the chances for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.The Nikkei rose 1.0 percent to 18,336.09 in mid-morning trade, extending its gains into a sixth day and is poised to post the longest winning streak since mid-July. Meanwhile, the Topix gained 0.9 percent to 1,460.27, rising for a 10th day.“The Nikkei could rise further towards the end of the year, possibly above 19,000 depending on the dollar-yen and U.S. yield levels,�� said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist and economist at Mizuho Securities.But he cited that there is growing uncertainty over upcoming global events, which could be a turnaround of the current risk sentiment and trigger profit-taking.He said that investors are closely focused on a meeting of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Nov. 30 as well as Italy’s referendum that could unseat Prime Minister Matteo Renzi early next month.Automakers were in demand, with Toyota Motor Corp surging 3.3 percent, Honda Motor Co rising 3.0 percent and Nissan Motor Co up 2.4 percent.Calsonic Kansei shares were untraded amid heavy buy orders after news U.S. buyout firm KKR &amp; Co is buying the company from Nissan Motor and other shareholders for as much as 498.3 billion yen.On the other hand, drugmakers dropped, with Takeda Pharmaceutical losing 0.9 percent, Astellas Pharma down 0.5 percent and Eisai Co tumbling 5 percent.The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 1.0 percent to 13,108.94.

DETROIT, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will alert about 700,000 owners of three Lexus models built over the last several years of a problem with the emergency trunk release, Consumer Reports magazine said on Wednesday.The automaker will make the announcement next month. The affected models include 2007-2013 Lexus ES mid-size sedans, 2006-2012 Lexus IS cars and the 2013 Lexus GS sedan.In these vehicles, a lever allowing a person to open the trunk from the inside was easily broken. Toyota is replacing the release with a “more robust�� polypropylene version with supporting ridges, the magazine said.Consumer Reports flagged the problem in October after the four-year-old son of the magazine’s auto testing director found the problem with the trunk lever.The lever has been mandatory since the 2002 model year. In these models, it snaps off when pulled toward the driver’s side. It works when pulled straight down or toward the passenger side.	12.71541686
TOKYO, May 14 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Thursday it would recall another 4.8 million cars globally to replace potentially fatal air bag inflators made by Japan’s Takata Corp, already at the centre of one of the biggest automotive recalls to date.The recall comes a day after Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co said they were taking back some 6.5 million vehicles worldwide after investigations showed the Takata airbag inflators were not properly sealed and so could be damaged by moisture.Honda has so far borne the brunt of the recalls linked to the Takata air bag inflators, which can erupt with too much force, spraying shrapnel inside the car. Six deaths have so far been linked to the defective air bags, all on cars made by Japan’s third-largest automaker.

* European car sales rise for fourth month* Dec gain is biggest monthly increase since Dec 2009* Renault, VW, Ford, GM, Toyota post double-digit growthBERLIN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Renault, Volkswagen and Ford spurred monthly European car sales to their highest year-on-year gain in four years in December, industry data showed on Thursday, as the sector recovery spreads to Mediterranean markets.Registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association trading bloc jumped 13 percent to 948,090 vehicles, the fourth straight monthly gain, the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) said.Italy, the region’s fourth-biggest market, swung to growth of 1.4 percent after eleven consecutive months of contraction as all major markets increased sales. Greece and Portugal, victims of the euro zone’s debt crisis, posted double-digit growth.“The recovery process in Europe is seemingly taking hold,�� Matthias Wissmann, head of Germany’s VDA auto industry lobby said. “People are building up trust again in the strength of economies.”The December rally pared the sales decline for 2013 to 1.8 percent or 12.3 million cars, the sixth consecutive year of contraction but a more modest fall than many in the industry had feared earlier in 2013.Sales at Renault rose 29 percent, driven by a 48 percent-surge at its low-cost Dacia brand. Germany’s VW, Europe’s No. 1 carmaker by volume, gained 22 percent, with double-digit growth extending from luxury flagship Audi to the no-frills Skoda and Seat divisions.Ford registrations were up 19.5 percent and Toyota, the global sales champion, posted a 10.8 percent increase.For 2014, most industry executives and analysts expect a return in Europe to low single-digit growth while cautioning that further losses are likely as pricing remains under pressure due to chronic excess capacity.Even automakers beset with losses or lacking new models won respite across the market of 30 countries.French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen and Italy’s Fiat swung back to sales growth of 8.6 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, from declines of 1.2 percent and 5.8 percent in November.GM deliveries bounced back to 13 percent growth from a 3.8 percent contraction a month earlier, even as the U.S. carmaker is withdrawing its underperforming Chevrolet marque from Europe to focus on reviving mid-market Opel.The loss-making Opel/Vauxhall brands sprung back to 22 percent growth, after a 3.1 percent drop in November.“There were some early signs of green shoots in the final quarter�� of 2013, Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said in a Jan. 13 research note. “But it’s patchy and far from sufficient to rescue the industry.�� (Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by John Stonestreet)	-2.44147999

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Seven U.S. states and 16 major automakers are launching a joint $1.5 million advertising campaign to prod Americans to buy electric vehicles.Automakers are investing billions of dollars to develop dozens of new EVs in the face of regulatory requirements, but face slow U.S. sales.General Motors Co GM.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and many other companies, along with Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.The campaign, dubbed “Drive Change. Drive Electric,�� will focus on the benefits of electric cars.“Far too many drivers remain unfamiliar with the benefits of driving electric. Increasing sales of electric cars will deliver critical environmental and economic benefits across the region,�� said Arthur Marin, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management.Electric vehicle sales rose 25 percent in 2017 to a new record but still account for only 1.2 percent of U.S. vehicle sales.The campaign will initially focus in the northeast region and includes a website, advertising, social media, strategic partnerships and events and other content efforts.John Bozzella, who heads Global Automakers, a trade group whose members include Toyota, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and Honda Motor Co 7267.T, said more education efforts are needed as automakers offer dozens of EV models.“The companies are effectively ahead of the customer,�� Bozzella said in an interview. “We need to collectively help tell the story of the benefits of this technology and raise awareness.”Automakers are rapidly investing in EVs and say they plan to unveil dozens of new EVs in the coming years. They point to the growing range of EVs to travel on a single charge, lower battery costs and more recharging stations as all making the vehicles more attractive to customers.Joe Eberhardt, president and chief executive officer of Jaguar Land Rover North America, said in an interview at the auto show that companies must focus on consumer demand not regulatory mandates. “We need as an industry to find a way to convince customers that there is a real benefit and advantage to having an electric vehicle,�� he said.In January, Ford Motor Co F.N said it would double its electrified vehicle spending. Reuters reported that global automakers plan to invest $90 billion in batteries and electric cars in the coming years, an amount that is still growing.Investments in electrified vehicles announced to date include at least $19 billion by automakers in the United States, $21 billion in China and $52 billion in Germany.Automakers also are reacting to pressure from regulators in Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels and mandates from California to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles.��	0.4678990565
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday thanked General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI and other major automakers for ""standing with"" his efforts to bar California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules for cars and trucks.“California has treated the Auto Industry very poorly for many years, harming Workers and Consumers,�� Trump wrote on Twitter.The automakers�� decision to side with the Trump administration follows legal challenges by California and 22 states and environmental groups in September.Those challenges aim to undo the administration’s determination that federal law bars California from setting its own rigorous tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.The decision to back Trump, disclosed in a filing with a U.S. appeals court late on Monday, has prompted a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.It also poses a risk for the automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in November 2020 and reverses Trump’s actions, allowing California to set its own rules and revert to the tougher national emissions standards of the Obama era.The automakers did not immediately comment.California Air Resource Board chief Mary Nichols on Tuesday criticized automakers after noting they tried a similar tactic previously. “GM, Toyota and Chrysler are repeating the same legal arguments they lost back in 2004, hoping for a different result. Definition of insanity?�� she wrote on Twitter.U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said on Twitter automakers “caving�� to Trump’s “intimidation campaign won’t save these automakers�� and added the decision to align with Trump’s “anti-climate agenda for the sake of a little short-term profit and reprieve from @POTUS�� Twitter tirades will do long-term damage, both to the automotive industry and to our country.”Other automakers, such as Ford Motor Co F.N, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not joining the bid to intervene on the administration's side.The group backing Trump also includes Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS and Subaru Co 9778.T.In August 2018, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, reversing planned 5% annual increases.The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026 compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option. The final requirements are expected to be ready by the end of the year."	1.241429087

GRAPHIC: Thai auto-parts shares: link.reuters.com/nyb25w By Viparat Jantraprap BANGKOK, July 6 (Reuters) -- Thai auto-parts shares have unwound all the gains that they made in the past 12 months as heavily indebted households in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy tightened their purse-strings and refrained from new purchases.The automotive and parts subindex in Bangkok has fallen 0.4 percent so far this year. While that drop was smaller than the 1.3 percent decline in the benchmark SET index, it deepened a downtrend that began in September last year. The fall has also reversed all the gains that the subindex made after May last year when the junta took over the government and removed months of political uncertainty.Thai auto shares - comprising component makers such as Somboon Advance Technology Pcl and Thai Stanley Electric Pcl - surged 50.5 percent in 2012 as a tax incentive scheme for first-time car buyers boosted domestic auto sales. Since 2013, sales have fallen as the effect of the government scheme faded. The debt taken to fund those purchases has returned to haunt the market as the Thai economy cools. Yet analysts say auto shares have probably hit a bottom and point investors to now attractive valuations. The auto subindex’s earnings multiple of 14.5 is well below the broader market’s 16.9.Analysts are also bullish on exports. While auto production for the Thai market slumped 15 percent in January-to-May from a year earlier to 287,920, output for exports rose nearly 9 percent to 495,633. Global car makers are gearing up to boost exports from their Thai plants, with Toyota Motor Thailand and General Motors Thailand unveiling such plans last week. The industry, a sector promoted by the Thai government, will also benefit over the next three to five years from the second phase of the Board of Investment’s (BOI) eco-car project, which has so far drawn participation pledges from Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor and Honda Motor.“Indeed, there are signs of recovery in the second half of 2015, especially in the area of car exports,�� said Siros Satrabhaya, Thailand’s branch manager at J.D. Power Asia Pacific, a regional automotive research firm. “The recent depreciation of the baht and the measures taken by the Bank of Thailand will help to improve the competitiveness of the nation’s exports.�� (Editing by Ryan Woo)	-2.696781991
VIENNA (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE will keep its plants in Europe despite weak markets in the region that will require flexible manufacturing and could entail cuts to temporary staff, Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said.Winterkorn had told shareholders in Europe’s top carmaker on Thursday to brace for a tough year given faltering European consumer demand that is punishing the sector.In an interview with Austrian broadcaster ORF aired late on Friday, Winterkorn said VW would not follow the example of other automakers and scale back production in Europe.“No, we will not withdraw any capacity from Europe but rather preserve capacity in Europe,�� he said. But he left the door open to trimming temporary staff that the company built up in boom years.“The regular staff is certainly something we will hold on to. We will have to think about temporary staff,�� he said.Volkswagen said last month it planned to almost double production capacity in China over the next five years to grab a bigger slice of fast-growing emerging markets and offset declining demand at home.Its goal is to snatch the global sales crown from Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T in 2018.	5.697614553
EditorsNote: delete “the�� in 3rd grafDamian Lillard and CJ McCollum combined for 49 points as the Portland Trail Blazers controlled the tempo throughout their 117-107 victory over the host Houston Rockets on Wednesday at Toyota Center.Lillard posted 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists while McCollum added 24 points and six assists to lead a Portland attack that featured all five scorers tallying double figures.The Rockets lost for the third time in four games, falling behind late in the first quarter and laboring in vain to close the gap. The Rockets did string together three consecutive 3-pointers midway through the fourth quarter to pull to within 105-100 only for McCollum and Carmelo Anthony to respond with back-to-back corner 3s that allowed Portland to reclaim control.Anthony, playing in Houston for the first time since the Rockets released him early last season, posted a double-double of 18 points and 12 rebounds.Portland center Hassan Whiteside also had a double-double (18 points, 18 rebounds) while Kent Bazemore added 12 points, nine boards and sound defense on Rockets guard James Harden, who scored a season-low 13 points on just 3-for-12 shootingRussell Westbrook produced a triple-double of 31 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists while Eric Gordon scored 20 points off the Houston bench. Ben McLemore added 17 points and Clint Capela a double-double (14 points, 18 rebounds), but with Harden taking just 12 shots, Houston lacked the offensive thrust to keep pace with the Trail Blazers.Balanced scoring carried Portland early and enabled the Trail Blazers to carve a working margin bridging the first and second periods. Portland flipped a two-point deficit late in the opening quarter into a 39-31 advantage with just over nine minutes remaining in the first half as five different Trail Blazers scored during that 15-5 run.Portland didn’t shoot particularly well prior to the intermission, connecting on just 42.9 percent of its field goals, but the shared approach kept the Rockets scrambling defensively. The Trail Blazers closed the first half with an 11-6 push keyed by a Lillard corner 3, second-chance baskets from Whiteside and Anthony, and two Lillard free throws that gave Portland a 60-47 lead at the break.--Field Level Media	-0.5139186296
JAKARTA, April 8 (Reuters) - Total car sales by Indonesia’s automotive sector is expected to plunge 50% this year as domestic and export demand shrinks due to the coronavirus pandemic, the country’s industry ministry said on Wednesday, citing industry association Gaikindo.Last year, a total of 1.03 million cars were sold in the country, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, while more than 843,000 units were exported in the form of completely knocked-down or completely built-up units, data from Gaikindo shows.The industry ministry said in a statement that it has put forward Gaikindo’s request for tax breaks to the finance ministry to help automakers weather the impact of the virus, which has infected 2,738 people in Indonesia and killed 221.Globally, the virus has infected around 1.4 million and killed over 81,000, upending lives, businesses and disrupting supply chains as governments impose lockdowns to contain the spread. Travel curbs have hit demand across several sectors, including autos, as people stay at home.For Indonesia, the auto sector is an important indicator of economic health as domestic car sales are often used to gauge private consumption. The sector contributes about 4% to the GDP excluding oil and gas, according to the industry ministry.“Disruption in the automotive industry will affect the national economy as the industry has a significant contribution to GDP,�� Putu Juli Ardika, a director at the industry ministry, said in a statement.Domestic car sales in January and February fell 2.4% on-year to 159,997, while exports fell 21.5% to 103,765.Gaikindo had told the industry ministry it was facing problems procuring components from countries under lockdown, while some of its members have stopped production lines to protect workers from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Indonesia’s car market is dominated by Japanese brands, with Toyota and Daihatsu leading sales.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk’s fortunes have sure turned around fast. Just last June shares in Tesla, the electric-car maker he runs, had halved in six months as investors doubted whether a recent capital raise was enough; short-sellers pontificated about the imminent collapse of the company. Seven months and a near-160% gain later, though, and Tesla shares have hit a new high, and the company is worth just shy of $90 billion. That, like one of the acceleration settings on its cars, is ludicrous.There are reasons for optimism. The maker of the Model 3 finally hit one of Musk’s targets, delivering just enough cars last quarter to squeeze past the lower end of his goal of 360,000 to 400,000 for the year. And its factory in China is up and running, having taken less than a year to build, and can produce up to 500,000 vehicles a year.Justifying the stock price, though, requires steadfastly believing in one of two developments. The first is that Musk will soon have his company routinely selling some 3 million cars a year. That calculation is based on Tesla managing to improve its pre-tax margin, which in the third quarter was a lowly 2.8%, to around 7.6% and that as a mature, rather than fast-growing, company it trades at 8.6 times earnings �� both metrics a blend of luxury carmakers BMW and Daimler, and the best-performing mass-producer, Toyota Motor. It also assumes a 21% tax rate and that carmaking accounts for the vast majority of Tesla’s revenue.Those assumptions don’t have to be anywhere near so heady if the company is close to becoming a robo-taxi giant. Musk himself has pledged there will be 1 million self-driving-enabled Teslas on the road in 2020. Its owners could rent them out when not using them, with Musk’s outfit taking a cut as well as running its own fleet. The latter could, over time, bring in 10 times as much revenue as just selling the car, General Motors reckons.Trouble is, neither is realistic any time soon. The first would require a more than eightfold increase in production, way beyond Tesla’s current or planned capacity; the second demands regulatory approval and then customer acceptance that at present looks many years off. The most recent sales targets aside, Musk’s track record at delivering on promises is abysmal. At this point, shareholders are parking their money on a hope and a promise.Breakingviews calculator: tmsnrt.rs/35vVuyV	0.5480037008
SEOUL, Oct 25 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co reported July-September net profit of 2.17 trillion won ($1.97 billion), an increase of 13 percent and in line with market forecasts, with growth held back by labour strikes in South Korea even as overseas sales rose.A Reuters poll of 13 analysts had predicted on average a net profit of 2.13 trillion won for Hyundai, which with affiliate Kia Motors is the world’s fifth-biggest car maker.Net profit in the year-ago period was 1.92 trillion won, while Hyundai earned 2.55 trillion won in the second quarter.The industrial action in South Korea in July and August was Hyundai’s costliest ever - with lost production of more than 82,000 cars worth $1.5 billion. Hyundai has almost half its global production in South Korea.Shares in Hyundai Motor last traded more than 2.5 percent higher after the results on Thursday.The stock slumped more than 13 percent this month to Wednesday’s close, while the benchmark index lost 4 percent. Over the same period, major Japanese rivals Honda Motor Co Ltd, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp gained around 7 percent, 4 percent and 2 percent respectively.	10.55449331
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Sales at India's biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India MRTI.NS, which sells one in every two cars in the country, fell 16% in the last fiscal year, hit by a slowing economy and lean demand as well as the coronavirus outbreak. Maruti, majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T, sold 1.56 million vehicles during the year ended March 31, compared with 1.86 million in the previous year, the company said on Wednesday.The coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly 800,000 people across the world and caused more than 38,800 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. In India, 32 people have died from 1,251 confirmed infections so far.To curb the spread of the virus, the government last week sent the country into a 21-day lockdown, forcing automakers such as Maruti, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra MAHM.NS, Ford Motor Co F.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS to suspend manufacturing.Maruti sold 83,792 units in March, compared with 158,076 units a year earlier, but said the numbers were not comparable as it had to suspend operations from March 22 in the wake of the government order.“The shutdown started only last week, so the fall is still steep even if it is not comparable,�� said Shashank Kanodia, an auto analyst at ICICI Securities.“If this is the trend, we can expect to be negatively surprised by all automakers.”The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, an industry body, estimates that plant closures by automakers and auto part manufacturers are expected to lead to a daily revenue loss of more than 23 billion rupees ($305 million).In the last fiscal year, India’s Nifty auto index &lt;.NIFTY AUTO&gt; tumbled nearly 44% as slowing economic growth and the rising cost of car ownership made consumers reluctant to spend and auto sales hit record lows.(Graphic: Nifty and Nifty Auto index's monthly performance in the last fiscal year link: )In March, as financial markets across the globe were battered over fears of the impact of the virus on the economy, the auto index crashed 31.47%.(Graphic: Nifty and Nifty Auto index's comparison for the last fiscal year IMAGE link: )	3.778596521
(Fixes spelling of Patuanelli in paragraph 18)* FCA, Peugeot mandate boards to pursue binding agreement* Combination would create carmaker with 8.7 million vehicle sales* PSA’s Tavares to be CEO, FCA’s Elkann to be chairman* FCA shares jump as much as 11%, PSA’s slide as much as 14%MILAN/PARIS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA plan to join forces in a 50-50 share merger to create the world’s fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand.Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and PSA said on Thursday they aimed to reach a binding deal to create a $50 billion group with listings in Paris, Milan and New York, and with PSA’s Carlos Tavares as chief executive and FCA’s John Elkann as chairman.It was less than five months ago that FCA abandoned merger talks with PSA’s French rival Renault and the move comes as carmakers grapple with a downturn in their markets as well as hefty investments in electric and self-driving vehicles.FCA would get access to PSA’s more modern vehicle platforms, helping it to meet tough new emissions rules, while Europe-focused PSA would benefit from FCA’s profitable U.S. business featuring brands such as Ram and Jeep.However, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said that, adjusting for the differences in market value and planned dividend payments, achieving the 50-50 split would effectively see PSA paying a 32% premium to take control of FCA.FCA shares jumped as much as 11% to hit a one-year high of 14.248 euros. PSA shares fell as much as 14% to touch a two-week low of 22.38 euros.“PSA shareholders are assuming more market risk than FCA’s,�� Houchois said, although he added an PSA-FCA deal was still the most logical and attractive combination in the industry.PSA and FCA said they would seek to finalise a deal in the coming weeks to create a group with 8.7 million in annual vehicle sales, putting it fourth globally behind Volkswagen, Toyota and the Renault-Nissan alliance.They aim to make 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of savings without plant closures, and achieve around 80% within four years, at a one-off cost of 2.8 billion euros.The group will include the Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Peugeot, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands, allowing it to serve mass and premium passenger car markets as well as trucks and light commercial vehicles markets.The plan comes at a difficult time for automakers. Manufacturers Ford, Daimler and Volkswagen and supplier Continental have in the past months lowered their forecasts citing a steeper-than-expected drop in demand.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the plan, which would give Paris a say in two of the world’s top four carmakers. That contrasts with a FCA-Renault merger, which risked leaving PSA behind.“It gives us critical size to face the dual challenges of autonomous vehicles and electric cars,�� Le Maire told reporters.Paris, which has a 12% stake in PSA, was blamed for the collapse of the FCA-Renault talks by urging Renault to focus on its existing alliance with Japan’s Nissan. The French government also owns 15% of Renault.However, the PSA-FCA deal could still be subject to close regulatory scrutiny, while Rome, Paris and unions are all likely to be wary about potential job losses.Italian industry minister Stefano Patuanelli said the deal was good news provided it didn’t affect jobs in Italy.The combined group will be domiciled in the Netherlands, but have operating centres in France, Italy and the United States, and will have an 11-person board, with six members coming from PSA including Tavares, and five from FCA including Elkann.Analysts, who questioned whether FCA and Renault had the management expertise to deliver a mega-merger, said Tavares was the right man for the job, having returned Opel to profit after buying it from GM in 2017.The former Renault executive has emerged as one of the leading figures in the auto industry following the death last year of FCA’s former CEO Sergio Marchionne and the arrest of former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn.Marchionne long championed a merger for FCA, a cause that has been taken up by Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family that owns a 29.2% stake in FCA and will be the largest shareholder in a combined PSA-FCA, with a 14.5% stake.One industry source said Tavares had made savings at Opel by cutting engineering centres in Germany and consolidating activity in France. A similar move with FCA could fuel opposition in Italy.As part of the deal, FCA will pay its shareholders a 5.5 billion euro special dividend and hand them shares in its robot-making unit Comau. PSA, meanwhile, will distribute to its investors its 46% stake in supplier Faurecia.Citi analysts said the cash payout for FCA shareholders contrasted with the Faurecia shares, worth about 2.7 billion euros at Wednesday’s close, being offered to PSA shareholders, saying the latter were “being asked to remain patient.”China’s Dongfeng Motor has a 12.2% equity stake and 19.5% voting stake in PSA, and there has been speculation it might use the tie-up to sell its holdings.One banking source told Reuters Dongfeng would be able to sell its stakes, which could help ease the deal’s passage through U.S. regulators, given U.S.-Chinese trade tensions.Stricter anti-pollution rules from 2021 have triggered heavy investments into electric and hybrid vehicles as European lawmakers are forcing a 37.5% reduction in vehicle C02 emissions between 2021 and 2030, after a 40% cut between 2007 and 2021.A combination with PSA would give FCA access to the French group’s CMP modular platform, which was launched in 2019 for Peugeot’s e-208 compact city car, and donated for Opel to build the Corsa-e mini.The CMP platform was jointly developed by Dongfeng and PSA.Strategy firm PA Consulting has forecast FCA faces 700 million euros ($777 million) in emissions fines unless it radically shifts to selling more electric and hybrid cars.PSA has moved Opel and Vauxhall from nine GM platforms to just two, helping Opel to return to profit after more than a decade of losses.FCA is being advised by Goldman Sachs and D’Angelin; PSA is working with Morgan Stanley, Mediobanca’s Messier Maris &amp; Associes unit and Perella; and Lazard is advising Exor, the Agnelli’s holding company, sources close to the deal said.	0.3146678109
TOKYO (Reuters) - The total number of Japanese novel coronavirus infections hit more than 5,300 on Thursday, NHK public broadcaster said, showing no signs of slowing despite a state of emergency being imposed this week on Tokyo and six other areas.Tokyo’s nightlife districts of Shibuya, Akasaka and Ginza areas were much quieter than usual overnight as the state of emergency took effect, but cities have not shut down and many workers are still commuting to offices by day.The central bank warned that the coronavirus pandemic had created an “extremely high�� level of uncertainty for the world’s third-largest economy, with regional economies facing their worst conditions since the global financial crisis a decade ago.Japanese authorities are hoping to contain the outbreak without imposing a mandatory lockdown that could deal a major blow to an economy already struggling to cope.The state of emergency gives local governors stronger legal authority to urge people to stay home and businesses to close. In contrast to lockdowns in some countries enforced by fines and arrests for non-compliance, Japan is relying more on peer pressure and a tradition of respect for authority.Japan, where a cruise ship offshore was once the biggest source of infections outside China, had early success in limiting the coronavirus. But authorities have become more alarmed in recent weeks by a surge in local transmission.The number of infections rose by 384 on Thursday to 5,356, while the death toll edged up by 1 to 106, according to NHK.During a daily live YouTube broadcast, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said the capital had 181 new cases on Thursday, the highest daily jump.“I am asking for your cooperation to protect your life, protect your family, protect your colleagues and society�� she said.While Tokyo and the central government have been discussing what kind of businesses they will ask to close, Koike is considering making her own decision if they fail to reach an agreement, Kyodo news agency reported.Hideaki Omura, governor of Aichi prefecture, which includes the city of Nagoya and hosts Toyota Motor Corp, said he would declare a state of emergency on Friday even if the central government did not add it to the national list.“If we watch what’s happened in the last week it doesn’t look good and so we’re making preparations,�� he said.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in an afternoon press briefing that there was no need now to add Aichi and other areas to the national list.Even with less stringent restrictions compared with other countries, analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan to slip into a deep recession this year.While aggressive central bank actions across the globe have eased financial market tensions somewhat, corporate funding strains were worsening, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told a quarterly meeting of regional branch managers.“The spread of the coronavirus is having a severe impact on Japan’s economy through declines in exports, output, demand from overseas tourists and private consumption,�� he said.“For the time being, we won’t hesitate to take additional monetary easing steps if needed, with a close eye on developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak.”The BOJ cut its assessment on all of Japan’s nine regions for the first time in 11 years, saying their economies were weakening or under strong downward pressure.“The situation is quite severe. Business sentiment is souring. Firms dealing with inbound tourism and consumption are seeing sharp declines in sales,�� Yasuhiro Yamada, the BOJ’s Osaka branch manager overseeing the Kinki western Japan region, told a news conference.Orders for machine tools in March dropped 40.8% from a year earlier, preliminary data from the Japan Machine Tool Builders�� Association (JMTBA) showed on Thursday.The orders, regarded as a leading indicator on future spending on factory equipment, were especially dragged down by overseas demand, which fell 43.8% from a year earlier. Overseas orders hit their lowest level since January 2010, a JMTBA spokesman told Reuters.Shares of Oriental Land Co fell on Thursday after the operator of Tokyo Disneyland said it would keep the amusement park shut until mid-May.Entertainment facility operator Uchiyama Holdings said it was closing 43 karaoke shops and 11 restaurants until May 6.Fast Retailing said sales at its Uniqlo outlets were down 27% in March from a year earlier. But retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings Co reported a 3% rise in annual operating profit, thanks to robust sales of food and other daily necessities.At its policy meeting later this month, the BOJ is likely to make a rare projection that the economy will shrink this year, sources have told Reuters.The BOJ eased monetary policy in March by pledging to boost purchases of assets ranging from government bonds to commercial paper, corporate bonds and funds investing in stocks. The government rolled out a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package.	0.1701644923
BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE eclipsed Toyota 7203.T as the world's top-selling carmaker in the first quarter as the Japanese rival grappled with a series of production stoppages.Toyota’s worldwide sales declined 2.3 percent in the January-March period to 2.46 million cars, a spokesman said on Tuesday. VW, struggling to overcome an emissions scandal, reported earlier this month a 0.8 percent increase to 2.51 million vehicles in group deliveries.General Motors' GM.N quarterly deliveries also dropped, 2.5 percent to 2.36 million cars due to a slump in Latin America.Volkswagen’s worldwide group deliveries have so far not taken a beating from the diesel emissions-test manipulations, the carmaker’s biggest-ever corporate scandal, benefiting from strong demand for luxury Audi and Porsche models and Czech volume brand Skoda.The German group, which last week reported the biggest financial loss in its history after setting aside 16.2 billion euros ($18.31 billion) to help meet costs arising from the scandal, expects 2016 deliveries on a par with last year’s 9.93 million.Already handicapped by a one-week shutdown at domestic assembly plants in February, Toyota said earlier this month it would suspend much of its production at plants across Japan for another week after earthquakes in the country’s south led to a shortage of parts.So far this year, domestic production has accounted for roughly 40 percent of Toyota’s global output, with nearly half of all its vehicles produced in Japan exported overseas.	-5.433862931
DETROIT, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s U.S. unit said on Thursday it is recalling about 694,000 Sienna minivans in North America due to a shift lever problem.Toyota USA said that because of possible damage to the shift lock solenoid installed in vehicles involved in the recall, the minivans could shift out of “park�� and roll away without the driver depressing the brake pedal.The vehicles were made at Toyota’s plant in Indiana. The Siennas are from model years 2007 to 2009 and from 2004 to 2005.Most of the recalled vehicles, about 615,000, are in the United States. About 56,000 of the recalled minivans are registered in Canada, 23,000 in Mexico, 300 in Germany and 10 in Guatemala.Toyota spokeswoman Cindy Knight said Toyota has received reports of 21 “minor�� accidents in the United States and three minor accidents in Canada. Two of the incidents involved what Toyota called minor injuries, such as bruises.Sienna is the second-best-selling minivan in the U.S. market, behind the Dodge Caravan made by Chrysler, an affiliate of Fiat SpA. Sienna’s sales through August were up 5 percent from a year earlier at 86,459 and Caravan’s sales were down 15 percent at 94,639, according to Autodata Corp.	-1.450944265

EditorsNote: adds new final paragraphRain may have delayed the start of Sunday’s Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, but Kevin Harvick wasn’t wasting any time.On a late restart with 21 laps to go, Harvick shot out to his final lead of the night, the only one he would need, and cruised to the win.He won at the place where he earned his first Cup win back in 2001, replacing the legendary Dale Earnhardt.And he had led so much of the race Sunday, it was seldom in doubt barring a late caution to throw a wrench into his day.The race was scheduled to start at 1:06 p.m. ET after NASCAR officials moved up the start time Saturday due to expected bad weather, but rain in the morning delayed that until 3:32 p.m. ET. The green flag dropped, and they were off and running.Kyle Busch started from the pole thanks to being fastest in Friday qualifying, with Ryan Newman starting on the outside of Row 1.However, Newman dropped back quickly in his Chevrolet, and while Busch was competitive in his Toyota, it was Ford’s day.Harvick dominated the first stage of the race, shredding through the field to lead 65 of the first 85 laps to win the stage going away. He started 15th in his Ford Fusion, and the Fords have shown speed in the preseason and last week at Daytona.Ford had a redesign in NASCAR last season, but the teams running the Fusions appear to have a mature car set to compete in 2018 -- led by Harvick’s Stewart-Haas Racing team -- after the Toyota Camry of Martin Truex Jr. took the title in 2017.However, issues in the pits set Harvick back to start the second stage 19th, the last car on the lead lap on Lap 93 when the race resumed.It took him only another 20 laps to get back in the lead.Then pit stops late in the second stage set Harvick back and Brad Keselowski won it in his Ford, while Harvick finished fifth.Teams went for full fuel and four tires to start the final 155 laps to the finish.A Chevy Camaro won last week’s Daytona 500 with Austin Dillon at the wheel, but Daytona is a roll of the dice, and cars that possess horsepower, which Chevy seldom lacks, have a chance. However, the bulk of the schedule is about horsepower and aerodynamics, and the Fords appear to be ahead as the 2018 season carries on.As the race wound down, Harvick and his Ford proved to be dominant until the end.Keselowski came in second. Rounding out the top 10, in order, were Clint Bowyer, Denny Hamlin, Truex, Joey Logano, Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, Kyle Larson and Chase Elliott.--Field Level Media	-6.544824099
DETROIT Nov 12 (Reuters) - It is the automotive equivalent of Pavlov’s bell: when gasoline is expensive, U.S. car owners try to downsize, but once pump prices ring down, they salivate over big pickup trucks and SUVs.With gas prices dipping below $3 a gallon last month for the first time since December 2010, size is back in vogue.“The migration to trucks will turn into a stampede if these gas prices go lower or stay low,�� Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc, leading U.S. auto retailer, told Reuters.“Americans just love big.”Helping fuel the upswing is an improving economy and better fuel efficiency that allows people to go for size and feel less guilty about it.“A new Ford Escape (crossover SUV) is more fuel efficient than a 10-year-old Camry,�� says Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson. “The days of having to be ashamed of your Yukon seem to be fading,�� he said, referring to General Motors�� full-sized SUV powered by a V8 engine.Analysts and industry executives say SUV and truck sales have been rising already before fuel prices fell and cheaper gas could sustain the trend into 2015.In October, for instance, SUVs and trucks accounted for 72 percent of Ford’s sales, up from 68.5 percent a year ago, while Chrysler’s sales surged 22 percent thanks to strong demand for its Ram pickups and Jeep SUVs.With a greater share of big vehicles in their line-up than their European, Japanese and Korean rivals, the Detroit three - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are well placed to cash in on the trend.Pickups and SUVs remain a pillar of profitability for Detroit, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. automakers�� global pre-tax earnings, even though they make up just 16 percent of North American vehicle production.So far this year, they account for 77 percent of Chrysler’s U.S. sales, 68 percent of Ford’s and 54 percent of GM’s. compared with roughly 45 percent for Toyota and Honda and less for other rivals.Electric and hybrid vehicles that account for 2 percent of U.S. sales, are the big losers, with October sales of Toyota Prius down over 13 percent from a year ago, Ford C-Max down over 22 percent and Chevrolet Volt sales down about 29 percent.The challenge for carmakers is how do you adjust to buying patterns that follow wild swings in gasoline prices?AutoNation’s Jackson says you simply can’t and recalls 2008 when prices spiked above $4 in the summer to end the year around $1.60.“I was trading in Escalades on Smarts and by December they wanted the Escalade back.”Among Detroit’s Big Three, Ford is betting that fuel economy will remain a selling point, investing in its redesigned, more aluminum-intensive F-150 full-size pickup truck.Chrysler appears to be hedging its bets with its U.S. sales chief Reid Bigland talking of “very limited�� impact of gas prices so far. General Motors Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem struck a more optimistic note, saying the improving U.S. economy and its newly-found energy self-sustainability should sustain Americans�� appetite for size.“All else equal, Americans want large vehicle they can drive long distances.�� (Additional reporting by Paul Lienert; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)	4.840474787

Oct 4 (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators have opened an investigation to determine which automakers may have produced vehicles with gas-filled struts on rear liftgates that are prone to failure.The gas struts, made by Koblenz, Germany-based auto supplier Stabilus, were involved in four previous recalls of about 276,000 minivans sold in the United States. Now, safety regulators want Stabilus to give them a list of customers who may have used the same type of gas-filled struts.The gas-filled struts help raise, lower and support liftgates on vehicles with power liftgates. They could close unexpectedly due to a leak of pressurized gas, increasing the risk of injury, according to a filing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Also, the liftgates may drop unexpectedly after reaching the fully open position.Stabilus is a global auto parts supplier, and has U.S.-based facilities.The four past recalls all involved minivans: the Honda Motor Co Odyssey for model years 2005, 2008 and 2009; the 2004 to 2006 Toyota Motor Corp Sienna; the 2004-2006 Ford Freestar; and the 2004-2006 Mercury Monterey.The largest recall was for 196,222 Toyota Sienna, recalled in 20008. The Honda recall was in February of this year.The Freestar and the Monterey recalls were made in 2006. The Freestar and Monterey minivans are no longer in production, and the Mercury brand was killed by Ford Motor Co two years ago.An investigation is not a recall, but depending on the results of the probe, may lead to one or more of them.	4.697554698
TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday lifted its 2012 domestic sales forecast to 1.63 million vehicles, up 6.5 percent from its previous forecast and 36 percent higher than 2011.It now expects global sales to rise 21 percent to 8.58 million vehicles. Its forecast for 18 percent sales growth overseas was unchanged.	13.90460792
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Transportation Department will conduct an internal review of U.S. auto safety regulators in response to a series of safety lapses, including this week’s reports of defective air bags, a senior administration official said on Saturday.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the review of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would look at what has occurred and what can be done better to ensure safety.The safety regulatory agency has faced criticism and congressional scrutiny with millions of vehicles facing recalls over faulty airbags or ignition switches.The House of Representatives�� Energy and Commerce Committee is to hold an initial briefing with U.S. safety regulators next week to learn the details of the regional recalls affecting 10 automakers, a committee aide said on Friday.The news of the review emerged days after Toyota Motor Corp recalled 247,000 vehicles in the United States because of potentially defective Takata air bags that can rupture and spray metal shrapnel at occupants.NHTSA has urged owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors vehicles to replace installed air bags as soon as possible. The safety agency said the number of vehicles affected by the recalls is 7.8 million.(story corrects to fix name of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in second paragraph)	6.533146755
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. vehicle fleet hit a record for fuel efficiency in 2018 averaging 25.1 miles per gallon (mpg) in real-world driving as it rose 0.2 mpg, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said.The fleet is also preliminarily anticipated to jump to 25.5 mpg for the 2019 model year.The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are working to finalize rules to rollback Obama-era requirements through the 2026 model year. Officials hope to finalize the new rules by April 1 but are still working to address remaining issues.The report also showed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV purchased a significant number of vehicle emissions credits, while Tesla Inc, Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp sold credits. Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and BMW AG also bought credits.Among the 13 largest automakers, only VW and Hyundai Motor Co saw average fuel economy fall in 2018, as they sold more SUVs and fewer cars.Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said automakers were far short of the 1 mpg improvement they were supposed to meet in 2018. “The rules should be strengthened to cut pollution and save consumers money at the pump,�� Becker said.EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler cited the small annual increases as evidence the Obama era requirements are “unfeasible.”A group representing nearly all major automakers said the report “demonstrates the market challenges that exist�� and noted most automakers needed to rely on credits to comply with 2018 requirements.The Trump administration proposed in August 2018 freezing fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026, erasing the increases enacted in 2012.The draft proposal would boost the stringency of U.S. vehicle emission standards by 1.5% annually from the 2021 through 2026 model years, Senator Tom Carper said in January.Carper said the draft would result in a 40.5 mpg fleet average by 2030. The administration’s 2018 proposal would have resulted in an average fuel efficiency of 37 mpg by 2026, compared with 46.7 mpg under the Obama rules.The administration argues the rollbacks are necessary for economic and safety reasons, but California and environmentalists reject that, saying consumers would spend hundreds of billions more in fuel costs.An EPA science advisory board analysis released on Monday found “significant weaknesses in the scientific analysis of the proposed�� rollback, adding it leads to “implausible results regarding the overall size of the vehicle fleet�� by predicting hiking prices will cause the vehicle fleet to “grow substantially when it would usually be expected to shrink.”The EPA said that when finalized the “analysis backing the final rulemaking will be publicly available�� and the administration will respond to all comments.	-10.02672776
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T expects its pace of growth in China to almost halve in 2015 after failing to meet last year's target and as dealers demand compensation to atone for lackluster sales.Japan’s top carmaker said on Tuesday it sold about 1.03 million vehicles in China in 2014, up 12.5 percent from the previous year but short of its sales target of more than 1.1 million. In 2015, the carmaker aims to sell 1.1 million vehicles in the country, representing a growth of 6.8 percent.Japanese carmakers in China faced the twin challenges of a slowing economy and flares of political tension between Beijing and Tokyo over the last year. Growth of China’s auto market, the world’s biggest, halved to around 7 percent in 2014.But unlike rivals Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T, Toyota chose not to trim its China sales target. Some Toyota dealers complain that they were forced to buy stock from the carmaker due to unrealistic sales goals, resulting in bloated inventories and heavy losses.Last week, the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), representing more than 500 Toyota dealers, submitted a letter to Toyota’s joint venture with China FAW Group Co [SASACJ.UL], demanding 2.2 billion yuan ($354.14 million) in subsidies and more realistic sales targets.Song Tao, CADA’s deputy secretary, told Reuters that FAW-Toyota agreed to negotiate with the dealers through a dealers�� council. Toyota declined comment.The Jiangsu Automobile Trade Management Association, which represents dealers in the eastern province, has repeatedly complained to FAW-Toyota about its sales practices.The body said that 30 of 34 FAW Toyota dealerships in Jiangsu were losing money, partly because they were obliged to buy a set number of cars from FAW Toyota or face penalty fees.But with Chinese dealers becoming more vocal, and united, in their dispute with manufacturers over who should bear the brunt of the market slowdown, there are signs that the balance of power could be shifting.German premium carmaker BMW BMWG.DE has agreed to pay 5.1 billion yuan ($820 million) of subsidies to its dealers in China, CADA said on Monday.	7.895167895
(Adds confirmation of Lexus ES production in Kentucky)TOKYO, April 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has been offered $146.5 million worth of tax breaks from the State of Kentucky to add production capacity at its Georgetown plant where, a company source told Reuters on Thursday, it will build the Lexus ES from 2015.The offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority in a preliminary approval published on Wednesday comes as Toyota’s president, Akio Toyoda and Jim Lentz, the manufacturer’s head in North America, prepare to make an announcement on U.S. production on Friday.The pair will unveil a plan to build the Lexus ES in Kentucky, the first time the luxury model, currently made only at Toyota’s Kyushu plant, will be fabricated outside Japan, a Toyota executive said, confirming media reports in Japan about the production change.The executive spoke on condition he was not identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.A Toyota spokesman declined to comment.The Georgetown facility will eventually produce as many ES cars as Toyota sells in the U.S. and Canada, which last year added up to 59,000 cars, the source said. The ES hybrid variant will still be made exclusively in Japan, he addedExpanding output at the Kentucky facility, which is operated by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky Inc., would fit with the automaker’s strategy of adding capacity at existing plants rather than breaking ground at new locations. Toyota had previously said it would freeze plans for any new plants for the next three years.The tax incentives being offered by Kentucky would be spread over 10 years on an estimated investment of $531 million, creating 750 new jobs, according to a copy of the preliminary approval.The luxury ES, which Toyota does not sell in Japan, was the second most popular Lexus model in the United States in 2012 after the RX SUV, which it has been building in Canada for several years.When the new ES went on sale last year, Toyota executive Kazuo Ohara said Toyota was aiming to sell about 10,000 of the vehicles a month, including 5,000 in the United States and 3,000 in China. Overall, Toyota wants to sell about 500,000 Lexus vehicles globally in 2013, 23,000 more than last year.The boost to the Georgetown plant underscores an improvement in the carmaker’s fortunes in the key U.S. market where it has been buffeted by recalls, litigation and rivals such South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co aiming to grab its market share. Toyota’s U.S. sales rose 27 percent last year and 9 percent in the first three months of 2013 compared with the same period last year.Toyota and other Japanese automakers have been pushing to increase production of vehicles in the markets where they sell them to counter a strong yen that had made exporting from Japan expensive. The yen’s decline since late last year has not changed that strategy.Toyota’s 500,000 vehicle-capacity Kentucky plant makes the Camry sedan, its best-selling model in the United States, as well as the Avalon sedan and Venza crossover. It also makes hybrid variants of the Camry and Avalon, which share the same platform as the Lexus ES.

TOKYO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects its global production under the Toyota and Lexus brands to hit 8.7 million vehicles in 2013, nearly the same as the 8.74 million vehicles it expects to have produced in 2012, the Japanese automaker said on Wednesday.Global sales of Toyota and Lexus brands are expected to be at 8.9 million vehicles in 2013, up 2.5 percent from the sales expected this year.Group-wide, Toyota expects to produce 9.94 million vehicles and sell 9.91 million vehicles in 2013. The group-wide forecasts include figures at Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd.For 2012, Toyota expects its group-wide production to be 9.92 million vehicles globally, up 26 percent from a year ago, as it recovers from a huge earthquake in Japan and Thai floods that took place in 2011.It sees its group-wide global sales for 2012 to be 9.7 million vehicles, up 22 percent.	2.420574887

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is investing in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab as part of a partnership that the two companies said will allow them to collaborate on technology projects, including big data and artificial intelligence.The companies did not disclose the deal value.Grab had earlier said it planned to raise roughly $3 billion by year-end, of which it has already raised $2 billion.Last week, Reuters reported that existing backer SoftBank Group Corp was closing in on a deal to invest about $500 million in Grab as part of the funding round.Sources told Reuters that Grab is likely to tap strategic and financial firms for the remainder of the funding.Before Tuesday’s deal, it raised $2 billion in 2018, led by Toyota Motor Corp and financial firms, including Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen’s Vulcan Capital.Singapore-headquartered Grab has taken its ride-hailing business to 235 cities in eight countries in Southeast Asia in the past six years.It is looking to transform itself into a leading consumer technology group, offering services such as food and parcel deliveries, electronic money transfers, micro-loans and mobile payments, besides ride-hailing.Grab will work with Microsoft to explore mobile facial recognition, image recognition and computer vision technologies to improve the pick-up experience, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.For example, passengers will be able to take a photo of their current location and have it translated into an actual address for the driver.Other areas of the five year-agreement include Grab adopting Microsoft’s Azure as its preferred cloud platform and using it for data analytics and fraud detection services.Southeast Asia, home to some 640 million people, is shaping up as a battleground for global technology giants such as Alibaba, Tencent Holdings Ltd, JD.com, Alphabet Inc’s Google and SoftBank, particularly in ride-hailing, online payments and e-commerce.Competition for Grab is heating up with Indonesian rival Go-Jek also expanding in the region.	-2.193128753

YOKOHAMA, Japan, July 16 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor on Monday unveiled its second-generation Note model, aiming to boost the distant laggard in Japan’s compact car market led by Toyota and Honda.Nissan sold 46,475 Note vehicles in Japan in 2011, trailing in 13th place in sales of Japanese cars above 660 cc.Honda sold 207,882 Fit vehicles, ahead of Toyota’s Vitz on 128,725 Vitz cars but behind Toyota’s top-selling Prius hybrid.The Note will go on sale in Japan in September, followed by Europe and the United States in 2013. Nissan, Japan’s second biggest automaker, did not disclose the price of the car.The firm aims to sell 350,000 Notes annually, including 120,000 in Japan, said Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga.Nissan aims to sell 5.4 million vehicles globally in the business year 2012/13, up 10.4 percent from the previous year, and plans to introduce a total of 10 models globally for both its Nissan and luxury Infiniti brands during that period.The Note will be built in Kyushu, southern Japan, for the Japanese market and at its Sunderland plant in Britain for the European market.The U.S. version of Note, known as the Versa, is expected to go into production early next year in Mexico, then on sale in the spring.Globally, the vehicle will compete with cars such as the Ford Fiesta.Nissan has sold about 940,000 Note vehicles globally since the first-generation model went on sale in 2005.Compact cars made up about 30 percent of Japan’s auto sales in the first six months of 2012.	8.473906168
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Headlights on a third of U.S. midsize car models do a poor job, and only one, the Toyota Prius v, performed well enough with an optional upgrade to earn a good rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in results released on Wednesday.While they currently meet U.S. government standards, better headlights could reduce U.S. accident deaths and improve safety, the Arlington, Virginia-based group said.In its first ratings of vehicle headlights, the insurance group tested midsize cars to see how well they illuminate the road and whether they create excessive glare for oncoming vehicles. The group’s ratings carry weight with consumers so automakers work to win high marks in its tests.Government rules allow for significant variation in the amount of illumination that headlights provide in actual on-road driving, IIHS said.Of 31 midsize models it tested, 11 earned an acceptable rating, nine were rated marginal and 10 were poor. The Prius v was rated good when equipped with optional LED headlights and a feature that turns off high beams when there is an oncoming car.Vehicles getting acceptable ratings include the Audi A3, Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima. Vehicles with poor ratings include the Kia Optima, Chevrolet Malibu and Volkswagen Passat.Many luxury vehicles have poor-rated headlights, and many cars only get higher ratings with option packages. For example, the base Prius v, which has halogen lights, gets a poor rating.Some headlights are inadequate because they are not aimed properly at the factory. “Many headlight problems could be fixed with better aim,�� said IIHS engineer Matthew Brumbelow.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement Tuesday that its revised new car assessment program will give incentives for automakers to improve headlight performance.“NHTSA is committed to promoting a higher standard of safety, including in headlighting systems,�� spokesman Bryan Thomas saidA spokesman for the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and others, declined to comment.A 2007 NHTSA report found that 49 percent of passenger traffic deaths occur at night, while 25 percent of driving occurs at night. It’s not clear how much the fatality rate is related to lighting, versus driver behavior at night like speeding or intoxication.	-5.483271375
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N tumbled to nearly the bottom of an annual survey of vehicle reliability due to flaws in its touch-screen navigation and entertainment system, while Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T swept the top three spots.In a Consumer Reports survey released on Monday, Ford fell seven spots to 27th of 28 brands surveyed overall, while its upscale Lincoln brand fell 12 spots to 26th place.Two years ago, Ford placed in the top 10 with more than 90 percent of its models being average or better.Glitches in its small car transmission as well as its MyFord Touch and MyLincoln Touch systems have hurt the second-largest U.S. automaker in the rankings.“Only two years ago, Ford was Detroit’s poster child for reliability,�� Consumer Reports magazine said. “Since then, a perfect storm of reliability problems has dropped Ford to next to last among the 28 brands in our survey.This year, 60 percent of Ford models and half of Lincoln models were rated below average. None were rated above average.Sixteen of the 27 models in Toyota’s lineup won the highest rating. Toyota’s youth-oriented Scion brand kept the No. 1 spot on the survey. The Toyota nameplate rose four spots to No. 2. The luxury Lexus brand dropped one spot to third place.Touch screen entertainment and navigation systems now play a pivotal role in attracting car shoppers, but automakers have struggled to create systems that are both intuitive and safe.MyFord Touch was launched in 2010, but consumer complaints about speed and ease of use prompted Ford to upgrade the system in March. Still, Consumer Reports said it was too complex even after the upgrade.Ford’s top executives, including Chief Executive Alan Mulally, got smaller cash bonuses for 2011 when Ford fell short of quality goals partly due to the MyFord Touch glitches.“We listen closely and value feedback on our vehicles whether it’s from customers or third parties, such as Consumer Reports,�� Ford said in a statement on Monday. The company added that consumers who had the upgrades were 25 percent more satisfied.Ford’s worst performing model was the Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Sixteen percent of consumers who purchased an Explorer complained about the control systems, said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports director of automotive testing.Ford was also hurt in the rankings because three of its most reliable models, the Escape crossover and Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans, were redesigned for the 2013 model year.For the reliability survey, Consumer Reports uses data for the last three model years, except those redesigned for the 2013 model year.Like Ford, Chrysler sank in the reliability rankings this year, when Consumer Reports had enough data to rate the smallest U.S. automaker’s revamped lineup. The Dodge Charger’s rating was well below average, the magazine said, while the V8 Jeep Grand Cherokee had declining reliability.General Motors GM.N jumped in the rankings led by its Cadillac nameplate, which rose 14 spots to 11th place to become the highest-ranking U.S. brand. GM's other brands GMC, Buick and Chevrolet also improved.“The Volt extended-range electric car continues to have above-average reliability, and the compact Chevrolet Cruze, dismal in its first year, improved to average,�� Consumer Reports said in its survey.Fisher said that Cadillac’s reliability ranking may suffer in the future as consumers provide feedback about the recently launched CUE entertainment and navigation system.Audi, Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE luxury brand, shot up 18 spots, the largest gain of any brand. The brand, which has typically been near the bottom, landed in eighth place.The top seven spots in the survey were earned by Japanese brands. None of the brands produced a vehicle that was below average reliability, the survey showed.	11.66903317

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T expects its global vehicle sales to stay at record highs in 2020, even as demand shows signs of slowing in China and the United States, the world's top car markets. The Japanese automaker said it planned to sell a record 10.77 million vehicles next year, including cars sold under the Toyota, Lexus and Daihatsu brands along with Hino trucks, a touch higher than its plans to sell 10.72 million units for the year ending December.Competition to sell more vehicles is tight among the world’s biggest automakers as they try to boost sales to achieve economies of scale and reduce costs at a time when they are investing heavily to develop next-generation technologies including self-driving vehicles and electric cars.Germany's Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE has been the top-selling automaker for the past five years, delivering 10.83 million vehicles including its MAN and Scania heavy trucks in 2018.	-1.650396798
WELLINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - The number of new cars registered in New Zealand climbed 15.4 percent in March from the previous month, figures from the New Zealand Transport Agency showed on Thursday.Data showed 6,499 registrations for new cars last month, rising 6.9 percent on the year earlier and reversing a year-on-year fall in February, when they decreased nearly 25 percent.The number of used car registrations, which mainly comprise imported used cars, rose 7.2 percent on the month, but they were 7.9 percent lower from March 2011 and fell for a third consecutive month on a year-on-year basis.The number of new commercial vehicle registrations rose 30 percent to 1982 on the previous month, but were down nearly 8 percent on a year ago.Toyota cars accounted for the top-selling make at 1,005, followed by Hyundai with 674 autos. Registrations of cars made by Holden, a unit of General Motors , came in at 659.	-6.165036966
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Sunday will officially take the wraps off its long-awaited Ranger midsize pickup truck, a year ahead of its arrival in showrooms, as rivals consolidate positions in a segment Detroit automakers once gave up for dead.Ford executives did not disclose prices or fuel efficiency ratings for the new Ranger during a briefing for the media ahead of the official unveiling at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.More than two years ago Ford telegraphed its decision to re-launch the Ranger midsize truck in North America after killing the model in 2011. At the time, Ford executives said they could satisfy pickup truck demand - and make more money - by widening the price range and engine options of its larger F-150 pickup model line. Detroit rivals General Motors CoGM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NVFCHA.MI abandoned the segment around the same time.However, in late 2014, GM launched new Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Sierra pickups, and Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp7203.T and Nissan Motor Co7201.T reinvigorated their midsize pickup trucks, aiming at customers who wanted to haul bikes, surfboards and other bulky recreational gear, not sheets of plywood.As gasoline prices stabilized, more customers turned to the new, smaller pickups. GM in 2017 sold more than 145,000 Colorado and Canyon trucks. Toyota, the segment leader, sold more than 198,000 Tacoma trucks in 2017, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier and 27 percent ahead of 2014, according to figures compiled by Autodata.Sales in the U.S. compact pickup segment as a whole grew in 2017 to more than 417,000 vehicles, up more than 70 percent from 2014, according to Autodata.“We see more of an opportunity that didn’t exist five years ago,�� Ford truck marketing manager Todd Eckert said.Ford executives said the North American Ranger will share engineering and some design elements with a work-oriented pickup the company builds and sells in Southeast Asia and other markets. The exterior and interior styling of the North American Ranger will be aimed at a more affluent, recreational use buyer.The new Ranger will start arriving in North American dealerships in early 2019 and be assembled at its Wayne, Michigan, factory in suburban Detroit. Ford’s decision to invest $850 million in the Wayne plant to build the Ranger and a new Bronco SUV won praise last year from U.S. President Donald Trump.	-2.123650069
* To rise past 20,000, Nikkei needs to attract new money - analyst* Shares of Toyota Motor fall after disappointing profit outlook* Takeda Pharma soars on solid forecastTOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks were flat in choppy trade on Thursday morning as optimism from the weakening yen offset mixed performances in U.S. shares overnight, while Toyota Motor declined after its forecast undershot analyst expectations.The Nikkei share average rose 0.1 percent to 19,922.78 points in midmorning trade, while the broader Topix fell 0.1 percent to 1,583.78 points.Toyota Motor Corp fell nearly 2 percent, after the automaker forecast operating profit to decline 20 percent on the year to 1.6 trillion yen ($14.06 billion) for this fiscal year to March.The dollar was slightly up on the day at 114.31 yen after earlier rising as high as 114.37, its highest since March 15.Traders said investors were cautious with the Nikkei benchmark index near the key resistance line of 20,000 points.“Most of the recent rallies were due to short-covering by foreign investors who had sold in March and April on geopolitical concerns before such concerns receded,�� said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.Foreign investors sold a total of 1.6 trillion yen of Japanese stocks and futures between mid-March and mid-April, according to data from the Japan Exchange Group, the operator of Tokyo Stock Exchange.In the last week of April, foreign investors bought 569.65 billion yen in Japanese stocks.“Short-covering seems to be continuing and will likely run its course shortly,�� Miura said. “In order for new money to come in, we need to see solid gains in U.S. markets first as it’s an indicator of investors�� appetites.”In Japan, eyes were also on corporate earnings.Takeda Pharmaceutical soared 2 percent after the drugmaker expected a 16 percent rise in its operating profit for the year through March.Conversely, TDK Corp dropped 2 percent after forecasting a 62 percent decline in its net profit for this fiscal year.The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 was flat at 14,145.18 points.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus unit said on Tuesday it is ending its partnership with film and TV production firm The Weinstein Company after allegations that co-founder Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women.“Lexus has chosen to terminate its agreements with The Weinstein Company that saw the luxury automaker working with the film studio on certain film and television projects,�� a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail to Reuters.Toyota’s luxury brand had been a sponsor of reality television show “Project Runway�� which has been produced by Weinstein Co.The company’s cars will no longer appear on the show after the current 16th season, which has already been filmed, the spokeswoman told Reuters by phone.Lexus will also no longer partner with Weinstein Co for its Lexus Short Films series, which invited emerging filmmakers to submit their films for a chance to be produced by Weinstein Co.Hachette Book Group, the U.S. publishing house of French group Lagardere LAGA.PA, earlier said it had terminated the Weinstein Books imprint.Harvey Weinstein was fired as chief executive by Weinstein Co earlier this month. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Weinstein Co did not immediately respond to requests for comment.	3.032532287
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is still struggling to revive sales in China, part of a broader slump Japanese car firms are suffering as a result of a diplomatic row between the countries.Toyota’s sales in China totaled roughly 60,000 vehicles last month, a senior company executive said, compared with 81,800 cars the company and its Chinese partners sold in November last year.The pace of the last month’s decline - roughly 25 percent from a year earlier - eased from the previous two months but was still “far off from our more normalized and targeted sales pace,�� said the Toyota executive who declined to be named because the information had not yet been made public.Toyota’s numbers indicate that sales in China by other Japanese carmakers are also likely to be down. For most of those firms, sales are still falling at double-digit rates from 2011 levels, though the pace of decline has slackened recently.Toyota is expected to announce its China sales data for November on Monday, according to a Beijing-based company spokesman. He did not respond to calls seeking comment on November sales.“It probably won’t be until March or April when we see sales return to a pre-September pace,�� the senior executive said, echoing a consensus expressed by officials from other Japanese brands.Demand for leading Japanese car brands in China virtually halved in September and October. That reduced the Japanese firms�� collective market share in China’s passenger car market, which excludes trucks and buses, to about 17 percent from 19 percent at the end of August, according to the China Association of Automotive Manufacturers.Toyota’s sales fall in November followed a decline of 44 percent in October, and almost 50 percent in September.Violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September after Japan nationalized two East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese, by buying them from their private owners.Some Chinese consumers have since avoided Japanese-brand cars. In a widely reported incident during the height of anti-Japanese sentiment, a Chinese man was attacked by angry protesters for driving a Toyota Corolla. The driver was so severely beaten that he was partially paralyzed.At the start of the year, Toyota said it aimed to sell 1 million cars annually in China. This target is unlikely to be met until 2013 at the earliest.	12.05930423
YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T on Thursday cut its annual operating profit forecast by 43%, hit by a slump in vehicle sales and heaping more pressure on new management to fix a company still reeling from the scandal surrounding former leader Carlos Ghosn.Nissan’s sharply waning earnings power has already prompted plans to slash jobs, close manufacturing sites and drop product offerings, sources have said, as the automaker steps back from an aggressive pursuit of market share championed by Ghosn.The dismal outlook comes after Japan's No. 2 automaker posted its first quarterly net loss in nearly a decade, and contrasts with upbeat forecasts from rivals Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T.“We are making progress, but sales volumes have been weak so we need to do more restructuring than initially planned,�� Makoto Uchida, Nissan’s new CEO and its third since September, told reporters.He did not elaborate on what steps might be taken but added that the company’s financial position would continue to be tough in the next business year as it would take time to repair profitability in the United States, its No. 2 market.Nissan now expects operating income of 85 billion yen ($775 million) for the year to March, far less than an average forecast for 134.5 billion yen from 20 analysts polled by Refinitiv.It also said it would not pay a dividend for the second half and that its annual dividend would be 10 yen per share, a steep drop from the 57 yen paid a year earlier.The automaker, which has suspended operations in China due to the coronavirus epidemic, said it would restart output at three vehicle plants on Feb. 17. Two plants, including one in Hubei Province, the epicentre of the outbreak, will remain shut until at least Feb. 20.The outbreak has also caused Nissan to reduce production at three domestic vehicle factories throughout February due to a lack of parts and logistics issues.Nissan’s global vehicle sales tumbled 11% during the quarter, its brand image hurt badly by years of heavy discounting in the United States and other countries.Sales dropped 18% in the United States, with once popular models like its Rogue SUV crossover and its Sentra sedan falling out of favour. In China, the world’s biggest auto market, sales slipped 0.6%.It now expects to sell 5.05 million vehicles for the entire year, which would be its weakest sales performance since 2013.During the October-December third quarter, operating profit tumbled 78% and it booked a net loss of 26.1 billion yen.For an interactive chart on Nissan's vehicle sales and operating profit, click on tmsnrt.rs/38fKyYxSources have said Nissan is set to eliminate at least 4,300 white-collar jobs and shut two manufacturing sites as part of broader plans to add at least 480 billion yen to its bottom line by 2023.The moves, an expansion of a plan unveiled in July, will also include fewer car models, options and trims on offer, while marketing budgets as well as jobs at head offices in the United States and Europe will be slashed, the sources said.Ghosn, who was also head of alliance partner Renault RENA.PA, was arrested in Japan in November 2018, accused of understating his salary and using company funds for personal purposes. He has denied any wrongdoing, and staged a dramatic escape to Lebanon in December while awaiting trial. Nissan on Wednesday said it had filed a civil lawsuit in Japan against Ghosn, seeking 10 billion yen in damages over his alleged misconduct.	-22.58294684
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and rival Mazda Motor Corp are expected to announce plans on Friday to build a $1.6 billion U.S assembly plant as part of a new joint venture, a person briefed on the matter said.The plant will be capable of producing 300,000 vehicles a year, with production divided between the two automakers, and will employ about 4,000 people when it opens in 2021, the person said.A new auto plant would be a major boost to U.S. President Donald Trump, who campaigned on promises to increase manufacturing and expand employment for American autoworkers.The source, who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity, said the plant in a yet-to-be-determined U.S. location was expected to build Toyota Corolla cars and a Mazda crossover utility vehicle.Japan's Nikkei reported earlier on Thursday that Toyota would take a roughly 5 percent stake in Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T to develop key electric vehicle technologies and jointly build a factory in the United States.The source confirmed the Japanese carmakers planned future joint efforts on electric vehicles.Toyota said the two companies have been exploring various areas of collaboration under a May 2015 agreement, and added that the group intended to submit a proposal to its board on Friday regarding Mazda. It did not comment further.“The industry pace of electrification has really picked up,�� Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, widely known as the father of the Prius hybrid, said at an event outside Tokyo on Friday, declining to comment on the U.S. plant or a Mazda deal.He defended Toyota against concerns the company has fallen behind its competition on electric cars, citing new technology.Mazda said in statement that “nothing has been decided yet�� and added the company would have a board meeting today. It did not comment further.“Mazda needs electrification technology. In the past they’ve poo-pooed EVs, they’ve felt that they can make internal combustion engines more efficient, but the bottom line is that globally you need to have this technology,�� said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.With an R&amp;D budget of around 140 billion yen ($1.27 billion) this year, a fraction of Toyota's 1 trillion yen, Mazda has said that it lacks the funds to develop electric cars on its own. Subaru Corp 7270.T, Japan's smallest major automaker, also has a partnership with Toyota.Toyota, the world’s second-largest automaker by vehicle sales in 2016 and Japan’s dominant car company, has been forging alliances with smaller Japanese rivals for several years, effectively consolidating the Japanese auto sector.A new U.S. assembly plant would likely become the prize in a fierce competition among Midwestern and Southern states eager to expand manufacturing jobs.The plan comes as demand for cars has fallen sharply. Toyota’s Corolla sales in the United States are down nearly 9 percent this year.In North America, Toyota builds Corolla cars in Canada and Mississippi and announced plans in 2015 to shift Canadian Corolla production to a new $1 billion plant in Mexico.Mazda, whose annual global vehicle sales are one-eighth that of Toyota, currently exports vehicles from Japan and Mexico to supply the U.S. market, where it generates roughly one-third of its global vehicle sales.It caters to a niche audience in North America with its design-conscious sedans and SUVs, and has been focusing on developing more fuel-efficient gasoline engines.Trump in January criticized Toyota for importing cars to the United States from Mexico. The Republican president also threatened to impose a hefty fee on Toyota if it were to build Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico.But since January, Trump has praised Toyota for its U.S. investments. Toyota said in January it planned to invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years to meet demand.Last month, Trump complimented Toyota for completing its long-planned new North American headquarters in Texas.“We want to be the car capital of the world once again and we are taking steps to achieve that goal,�� Trump wrote.The White House declined to comment on the Toyota-Mazda joint venture.	-0.01759943682

(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)March 6 (Reuters) - Automakers and technology companies racing to develop self-driving vehicles are running into a problem: cars that can think are no good without affordable and reliable technology that allows cars to see.With the notable exception of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc , most automakers have said their self-driving cars will rely on a detection system known as lidar. The state of the art sensors use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car.Pressure to launch self-driving cars is already pushing many players to place bets on the technology. General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and BMW are expected to deploy sensors from well-funded lidar startups Velodyne and Innoviz on their initial self-driving cars over the next two years.More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been plowed into some 50 lidar startups over the past three years, including a record $420 million in 2018, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data.For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2EAsKuCVelodyne and Swedish supplier Veoneer Inc will provide lidar for Ford’s first automated vehicle in mid-2021, according to a source familiar with the project. Velodyne President Marta Hall describes the program as “a billion-dollar-plus deal�� for the privately held lidar pioneer, whose $75,000 HDL-64E can be seen on the roofs of many self-driving prototypes in Silicon Valley.But automakers and large suppliers have yet to settle on a winning technology, meaning there are no real sector standards for the sensors to date that would encourage mass production and lower the cost.The initial payoff for investors and startups looks thin. Automotive lidar is expected to generate only $2.5 billion in revenue by 2025, according to industry researcher IHS Markit.“You can overcome certain things with additional capital, but you can’t overcome physics�� in trying to rapidly develop, package and implement the latest lidar technology, said Austin Russell, chief executive and co-founder of lidar startup Luminar, which has funding from Volvo Cars and development deals with Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG’s Audi brand.“That’s the fundamental barrier that’s holding the vast majority of the industry behind.”Interviews with two dozen executives at startups, automakers, suppliers, investment and research firms underscored that there is plenty of chatter, but little consensus on lidar.Toyota has partnered with several lidar startups, including Blackmore and Luminar, but the Japanese automaker continues to evaluate new sensing technologies and is not keen for a shakeout to start yet, said Ryan Eustice, senior vice president of automated driving at Toyota Research Institute.“We want to see an ecosystem happen. There’s a diversity of technology that we’d like to gauge (and) different strengths and weaknesses in how you approach the technology. It’s also good to have competitive market pressure,�� Eustice said.Eventually, the lidar sector could be squeezed down to just five or six key players �� as happened with the far more mature radar sensor technology. But that is not likely to unfold until after 2025 and perhaps not until 2030, executives and researchers told Reuters.“It’s going to be a long runway,�� IHS Senior Analyst Jeremy Carlson said.That presents a big risk: investing in technology that may be obsolete by the time large numbers of those vehicles start rolling off assembly lines after 2025.If a vehicle assembler gets “too wrapped up in a technology, you might be at a disadvantage�� because a newer, less expensive system could come along, said Chris Heiser, CEO of automated vehicle software company Renovo.Even experts do not seem to agree on the etymology of the name lidar, which is either a mashup of light and radar, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, or an acronym for light detection and ranging (or, in some references, laser detection and ranging).Nor is there full agreement on whether lidar is really necessary to make self-driving cars work.Tesla CEO Musk insists the electric carmaker’s so-called “Autopilot�� system does not need it, relying instead on a combination of radar, cameras and software.Lidar remains a relatively young technology that is still in flux, with bulky electromechanical devices such as Velodyne’s popular rooftop unit rapidly transitioning to newer, more compact and more capable solid-state devices designed to sell for less than $10,000 in limited quantities, and eventually as little as $200 in mass production.“This requires quantum leaps in innovation in lidar technology,�� Thomas Sedran, in charge of evaluating Volkswagen’s autonomous strategy in commercial vehicles, told Reuters Tuesday at the Geneva motor show of the need to cut costs.Aptiv PLC has been among the most active suppliers in developing automated driving systems, investing in three lidar startups: Innoviz, Quanergy and LeddarTech. It is also a key supplier of automotive radar, a sensing technology often paired with lidar.Glen De Vos, Aptiv’s chief technology officer, said lidar could follow radar’s extended maturation process, with technology, size, cost and reliability optimized over time as demand and production volume ramp up.“It takes a few generations and iterations for that cost curve to come down,�� he said. “It could be a five- to 10-year process.��	4.264756056
(Adds comments from Toyota spokesman)BEIJING Sept 2 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is counting on a trio of significantly redesigned cars to help gain sales momentum in China and is on track to meet its goal to sell 900,000 vehicles in the country this year, a company spokesman said on Monday.Speaking after releasing data that showed a 4.2 percent year-on-year decline in its China sales last month, Takanori Yokoi, a Beijing-based Toyota spokesman, said the drop was due largely to its customers holding off purchases ahead of the launch of the redesigned RAV4 compact sport-utility vehicle.The new RAV4 began hitting showrooms in China during the final week of August.Toyota and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 72,100 automobiles in China in August, down 4.2 percent from a year earlier, it said in a texted message sent to reporters.That followed a 3.5 percent year-on-year drop in July and a 9 percent rise in June.Despite the two consecutive months of year-on-year sales declines, Yokoi said the Japanese company expects its China sales to regain momentum now that the new RAV4 is becoming fully available at its dealers across China.He said two additional products - the redesigned Vios and Yaris small cars that Toyota plans to launch in China during the fourth quarter - are also likely to add to that momentum.Toyota recently set the pricing for the new Yaris car, and Yokoi said its starting price has been set at 69,800 yuan ($11,400). The company has not announced its pricing strategy for the Vios.“We’re fairly confident that we are going to meet our sales goal�� of selling 900,000 vehicles this year, up 7.1 percent from 2012, Yokoi said.The spokesman said Toyota generally sells slightly more than 10,000 RAV4 cars a month. But as customers postponed purchases in anticipation of the freshly redesigned RAV4 model, volume dropped to slightly more than 1,000.“That sales drop alone more or less fully explains our August sales decline,�� Yokoi said.In the first eight months of this year, through the end of August, Toyota sold a total of about 564,600 vehicles in China, down 5.3 percent from a year earlier.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group.

BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - China sales by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners rose 68 percent in April from a year earlier to about 81,700 vehicles, according to a company spokesman.For the first four months of the year, the Japanese auto maker sold a total of about 293,200 vehicles, a 14.3 percent increase from the same period last year, said the spokesman, Takanori Yokoi.Yokoi said the large year-on-year jump in April sales was due chiefly to the fact that sales during April last year were comparatively low because of the massive earthquake on March 11 last year. The earthquake and tsunami paralyzed production of key components and affected Toyota’s vehicle production around the world, including China.Still, Toyota’s sales momentum was “fairly strong�� so far this year, said Yokoi. Because the company’s sales performance was so bad last year due to the impact from the earthquake Toyota “should be able to post double-digit sales growth at least for the next several months,�� the Beijing-based spokesman said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T forecast a bigger-than-expected 35 percent tumble in net profit for the current year due to the sharp appreciation of the yen, ending three straight years of record profits driven in part by a weak currency.The Japanese automaker said on Wednesday profit for the year ending in March 2017 will fall to 1.5 trillion yen ($13.81 billion) from 2.31 trillion yen in the prior year, far short of the average 2.25 trillion yen for the current year estimated by 28 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Lower profits forecast under the weight of a strengthening yen will make it harder for Toyota, the world’s most valuable automaker, to keep investing in new technologies and products even as competition intensifies in areas such as autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles.For the current year, Toyota said it was assuming the dollar would average 105 yen this year, versus a far more favorable 120 yen JPY= last year. Foreign exchange losses would therefore have a negative impact of 935 billion yen on operating profit this year, it said. “Earnings results in the past few years have been largely helped by foreign exchange rates,�� said Toyota’s President and Chief Executive Akio Toyoda at an earnings briefing, describing the yen’s weakness as “tailwind��.“But since the start of this year the tide has changed.”The yen’s sudden strength is creating a tough business environment for Toyota. Volatility in the yen’s value can have a major impact on Toyota’s earnings, as it exported nearly half of its domestic production in the past year.Each 1 yen move in the dollar/yen rate affects its operating profit by 40 billion yen. Toyota's smaller domestic peers Nissan 7201.T and Honda 7267.T are relatively less impacted by the yen's moves because a greater chunk of their production is done outside Japan. Nissan and Honda are reporting results later this week. ‘NO MAGIC WAND’Toyota Executive Vice President Takahiko Ijichi said the company plans to keep investing in technologies and expects fixed costs, which include investments, to remain at similar levels as the recent past.He reiterated Toyota’s goal of maintaining an operating margin of 5 percent and posting an operating profit even if the yen rises to 85 per dollar or 100 per euro.There is no “clever scheme�� or “magic wand�� to counter forex headwinds, said Ijichi, noting Toyota now has the experience of overcoming erratic currency swings through cost-cutting and other efficiency-boosting measures.The company expects operating profit, which excludes earnings in China, will drop 40 percent this year to 1.7 trillion yen. That does not take into account any impact caused by production stoppages that followed the deadly earthquakes in southwestern Japan last month, it said.Toyota, which was eclipsed by Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE as the world's top-selling car maker in the first quarter, said it expected global sales to inch up to 10.15 million vehicles in the year to March, from 10.094 million last year.Toyota shares have lost about a quarter of their value in 2016. In a bid to support them, Toyota announced a share buyback of up to $4.6 billion.	4.835432751
(Adds comments)BANGKOK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Thailand’s total domestic car sales are expected at 900,000 units this year, up 3.4 percent from 2017, Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Tuesday.Toyota, which commands about a third of the Thai market, estimates its own 2018 car sales in the Southeast Asian nation at 300,000 vehicles, up 24.9 percent from last year, the company said in a news conference.“Toyota’s exports of completely built up units (CBU) are expected to be maintained at 300,000 units due to situations in the Middle East, one of the most important export markets,�� Toyota Motor Thailand’s President Michinobu Sugata said in a statement.The company’s exports to the Middle East declined on low oil prices last year, Executive Vice President Chatchai Taveeesakulvadchara said.However, the company believes that exports to the U.S. and Australia would help it achieve targets, Sugata added.Thailand is a regional production and export hub for the world’s top carmakers, and the sector accounts for about 12 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T will begin production at its new Mexico factory in January, the carmaker's chief said on Wednesday, describing the plant as a key foreign base for the Japanese company as it pares its reliance on domestic output.“I just visited the Mexican plant and all preparations are complete,�� Mazda’s head, Masamichi Kogai said at a press conference at the Tokyo Motor Show. “This factory will become a crucial overseas base for Mazda,�� he added.Selling just over a million cars a year and with most of its vehicles built in high-cost Japan, Mazda has struggled to compete with bigger automakers that are 10 times its size. In the four years to March 2012, the company chalked up combined net losses of nearly 250 billion yen ($2.5 billion).Since losing the backing of Ford Motor Co F.N, which once owned a third of the Hiroshima-based company, Mazda has drawn closer to Toyota Motor Co 7203.T winning access to its hybrid technology. Mazda will also build cars for Toyota at the Mexico plant.	-5.791352638
TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it expected a third straight year of record profit, with rising sales in the U.S. auto market helping it to a modest improvement after a bumper year powered by foreign exchange windfalls and cost cuts.After net profit jumped 19 percent in the year ended March to 2.17 trillion yen ($18.1 billion), the world’s top-selling automaker said it expects net profit to rise 3.5 percent in the current fiscal year to 2.25 trillion yen. That’s below the average estimate of 2.44 trillion yen from a Thomson Reuters survey of 27 analysts.Toyota is forecasting operating profit will edge up 1.8 percent this year to 2.80 trillion yen. Its projections assume the dollar would average 115 yen this year - conservative compared with around 120 yen currently, boosting the value of U.S. sales converted back into the Japanese currency.

* Toyota less likely than rivals to cut FY f’casts on China row* July-Sept net profit seen at $2.9 bln, treble yr-ago* Regains global top seller slot in Jan-Sept* But may never regain peak U.S. market share - analysts* Toyota shares up 20 pct YTD, easily beating Honda, NissanBy Yoko KubotaTOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - For most companies, trebling quarterly profit to almost $3 billion and outselling all global rivals would be welcome news. But for Toyota Motor Corp , Japan’s biggest car maker, it’s still too early to say it has emerged from years of crisis.Toyota is likely to say later on Monday that it earned a net profit of 228.8 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in July-September, close to three times its year-ago profit when it was still reeling from the Japan earthquake and tsunami and Thai floods that ruptured its supply chain.This year has seen improved sales in the United States, Toyota’s biggest market, and in Southeast Asia. Over the first nine months of the year, Toyota and its group companies sold 7.4 million vehicles, more than any other car maker.Toyota is less likely to cut its full-year forecasts than Nissan Motor Co, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, or Honda Motor Co, which slashed its forecasts last week - even though sales in China virtually halved in September and October amid often violent protests against Japanese goods in a row over islets in the East China Sea.Due to accounting methods, the full impact of that may not be felt until the current and fourth quarters of Toyota’s business year. Toyota has around a 7 percent market share in China, the world’s biggest autos market, but is less exposed than rivals to that market. China accounted for about 12 percent of its global sales last year, some way below Nissan’s 27 percent and Honda’s 20 percent.Some experts expect Toyota, which provides more conservative forecasts than others, to offset much of the China hit through solid performances elsewhere - in the United States, Asia and in the Middle East.After a series of crises - from the global financial meltdown and damaging recalls to natural disasters and the China row - Toyota is again making money, but profitability in its core car business is much lower than its financial services unit, which brings in just 5 percent of revenue, but a quarter of operating profit.Investors and executives want to see real signs that Toyota is fixing its core problem. As the company’s president Akio Toyoda puts it: having to make “ever-better cars��.Toyota, which blazed a trail for mass producing quality cars, but then tripped up by expanding too fast into the U.S. muscular SUV and truck market at a time when the yen, too, was rising, has been on a relentless cost-paring binge.“From the Lehman shock to U.S. congressional hearings (over major 2009 recalls) and the earthquake and Thai floods, we faced many challenges and that has made us stronger,�� Vice President Mitsuhisa Kato said in August. “We are changing a lot from what we were. We want to prove how we have changed through our products, and we want to ask everyone to wait a little bit more.”One sign of change is Toyota’s more controversial designs tested on recent models. For example: the “spindle grille�� on some luxury Lexus models - a prominent grille pinched in the middle - gives the car a bolder, more aggressive look.“We are starting to think about how we can produce cars that stand out, rather than cars that are accepted by everyone but have no unique identity,�� said Toyota designer Ryo Ikeda.Another is the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), a new framework to build better cars and cut costs by developing multiple models simultaneously to use more common parts. Shared parts mean suppliers can produce a larger number of fewer parts, cutting the unit price. The framework focuses on three platforms, each carrying 8-10 models, Toyota employees said.The first car to be fully developed by the TNGA will be the revamped Prius for late-2014 release, followed by the subcompact Vitz and the next generation Camry - the perennial U.S. best-seller - around 2016, analysts said.As the global market evolves, Toyota is looking to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, and plans to double its China sales to 1.8 million cars by 2015. It has positioned Southeast Asia as a “second mother-base�� after Japan.Shares in Toyota - worth almost as much as Honda, Nissan and Hyundai Motor combined - are up by a fifth this year, easily outpacing Honda’s 2 percent gain and Nissan’s near 3 percent fall.But the U.S. market remains key to Toyota’s recovery.Toyota and Lexus�� U.S. market share jumped to 13.9 percent through October from 12.3 percent a year ago, and the brand is able to sell its mid-sized sedans with relatively low discounting. But experts question whether it can ever regain its 2009 peak share of 16.4 percent, given the increased competition.“It’s tough for Toyota to dominate the market again with its current product line-up. It needs to improve overall product attractiveness, including design and ride quality,�� said Masatoshi Nishimoto, autos analyst at IHS Automotive in Tokyo.In the past five years, South Korea’s Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors have almost doubled their U.S. market share to 8.9 percent, and the Detroit Three - General Motors , Ford and Chrysler - have increased their combined share to 47 percent from just above 44 percent after the global financial crisis.“All around the world, automakers were affected by multiple factors in the last four years. They are now all finally standing at the starting line ... The next few years are crucial to see if Toyota can bring its growth back on track again,�� said Nishimoto.	4.818684696
SYDNEY (Reuters) - New car sales in Australia fell for the 18th consecutive month in September, suggesting back-to-back interest rate cuts in June and July had failed to lift consumer spending as banks contain their lending.Data released by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) on Thursday showed total sales for September skidded nearly 7% to 88,181 vehicles from a year earlier. For January-September were down about 8% from the same period in 2018.The weak data will disappoint the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which cut interest rates for a third time this year on Tuesday to a record low of 0.75% in an effort to revive employment growth, consumer spending and inflation.The June and July cuts led banks to reduce mortgage rates, lifting the housing market out of its doldrums. But there have been few signs so far that those cuts boosted other businesses.In a statement, FCAI chief executive Tony Weber said slower car sales are “in line with the broader economic environment in Australia�� while also noting stringent lending standards as a factor.“Of particular concern to the industry is the restrictive regulatory lending conditions currently facing consumers,�� he said.Weber also said sales figures raise the question of whether “we have made it too difficult for people to finance basic purchases��.Annual loan growth in Australia fell to an eight-year low of 2.9% in August and total credit card debt was the lowest level in nine years.“Responsible lending�� has become a significant issue in recent days with the government as well as the RBA governor urging banks to loosen their purse strings.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told a property forum in Sydney that a balance needs to be struck while making loans as an “unduly restrictive application of these obligations can do as much harm as an overly lax one.”�It is in everyone’s interest that the aspirations of hard working families are not collateral damage in this regulatory process,�� he added.Thursday's data showed Toyota 7203.T held its top spot in the Australian car market with a 17.2% share followed by Mitsubishi 8058.T at 10.2% and Mazda 7261.T at 9.3%. 	7.134146341
TOKYO, June 16 (Reuters) - Japanese share prices tumbled on Thursday, with the broad Topix index falling to a four-month low, after the Bank of Japan refrained from introducing more stimulus.Although such an outcome had been widely expected, there had been some speculation about easing due to the fragile state of the Japanese economy and BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s history of surprising markets with policy decisions.The Topix fell as much as 2.2 percent to 1,249.04, its lowest level since mid-February while the Nikkei average fell up to 2.2 percent to 15,576.60, its lowest level since mid-April.Carmakers were among the worst hit, as the BOJ’s decision pushed the yen more than one percent higher to a near 22-month high of 104.505 yen per dollar.

* Nissan to extend China holiday production halt* Toyota says to suspend production at 2 factories from Wednesday* Suzuki says cuts one of two shifts in China* Output adjustments come on top of cuts linked to slower China econBy Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co. are cutting back production in China in the wake of anti-Japan protests that shuttered dealerships and darkened their sales outlook in the world’s biggest car market.Production slowdowns are a normal feature of the auto industry in mature markets like the United States and Japan, where they are used to keep inventories from ballooning and avoid pressure for automakers to offer deep discounts that erode profitability.But the steps by the Japanese automakers to cut output in China are an anomaly in a market that has driven the industry’s global growth over the past decade and where most automakers had been adding capacity until China’s economic slowdown in recent months. That caused production to outpace sales, resulting in larger-than-normal inventory levels at many car dealers.“For the time being I think you’re going to see Japanese automakers�� sales in China down by 20 to 30 percent,�� said Koji Endo, auto analyst at Advanced Research Japan.“The last time we had protests like this in 2010, the effects only lasted about a month, but I think this time is going to be different. This is going to have a serious impact.”Nissan, Japan’s top automaker in China, said it would halt production at a joint venture in China starting on Thursday, three days earlier than planned, and extending through next week’s national holiday period.Toyota plants in Tianjin and Guangzhou will also suspend production from Wednesday through the holiday, Tokyo-based spokeswoman Shino Yamada said, a few days earlier than planned. Production at factories in China may be further curtailed depending on market conditions, she said.As a result, a senior Toyota executive in Beijing said the company probably won’t be able to meet its goal of selling one million cars in China this year. In 2011, Toyota with its local Chinese partners sold about 900,000 cars in the country.“It’s very difficult to sell cars right now, but that’s true with every Japanese brand. Not just us,�� said the executive, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.In addition to Toyota and Nissan, Mazda Motor Corp. has decided to halt production in China on Friday and Saturday, giving workers two extra days off as part of the national holiday production shutdown.Suzuki Motor Corp. said it also had stopped one of two shifts that it normally runs in China.Anti-Japan sentiment in China escalated earlier this month after Japan said it would buy a group of disputed island in the East China Sea, called Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan, from a private owner. It sparked the latest flare-up in tensions between the Asian neighbors that has smoldered since the end of the World War Two.In protests across China, angry demonstrators vandalized properties of Japanese companies, including a Toyota outlet in the eastern city of Qingdao that was torched.A senior Beijing-based Toyota sales executive said the long-term impact of the dispute on Japanese brands was uncertain.“Unlike before, when sales recovered fairly quickly, things seem very different this time,�� he said. “But it’s still very difficult to gauge what kind of long-term fallout we are going to have.”The executive, involved with sales and marketing of Toyota’s Lexus brand in China, said all Lexus outlets in China had reopened and are operating normally.“But customers are expressing fears about owning Japanese-branded cars,�� he said, “and that worries me a bit.”The latest auto production adjustments come on top of general cutbacks Japanese auto makers had been making prior to the protests. Global auto makers in general have been coping with slower-than-anticipated auto sales in China this year.China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in more than three years in the second quarter. A factory survey in August showed China’s manufacturing sector contracted at its sharpest pace in nine months.In the auto sector, Japanese auto makers had a roughly 19 percent combined share of China’s passenger car market in August before the protests. That was down from 20 percent in July, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Bin Wang said his checks with Japanese auto dealers in Guangdong province since the protests showed that sales were down on average by 60 percent, adding that the slowdown had boosted sales for German, American and Korean brands.Endo, at Advanced Research Japan, said he expected Japanese automakers would continue to adjust production if sales remain weak and could take measures such as cutting shifts or slowing line speeds to keep inventory from building.As a result, he said, parts suppliers in both China and Japan would have to cut output as well.	-1.665183679
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s passenger vehicles sales are set to fall for a tenth consecutive month in August, forcing analysts to slash their 2019 sales forecasts and strengthening the automakers�� case for tax cuts to boost demand.Sales data from India's top six car makers, including Suzuki Motor Corp's 7269.T and Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Indian businesses, shows that passenger vehicle sales for August fell 34% compared with the same period a year ago. These six manufacturers make up more than 90% share of the market. Data from Tata Motors TAMO.NS and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra MAHM.NS, which together account for about two-thirds of the commercial vehicles market, show that sales of trucks, an indicator of economic activity, fell by almost 40%. The steep decline in sales to dealers is worrying industry executives who are renewing calls for a tax cut on cars, two-wheelers and trucks while auto analysts are cutting their sales forecasts for the year.The crisis in the autos sector is a huge problem for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government which last week announced a series of measures to boost bank lending for car buyers and dealers. The government is expected to provide further stimulus especially after data released on Friday showed that India’s GDP growth fell to a six-year low in the April-June quarter.“The (latest sales numbers) only highlight the need for the government to consider reducing the GST (goods and services tax),�� said Rajan Wadhera, president of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), adding that cutting taxes to 18% from 28% at present would lower the cost of vehicles and create demand.Wadhera said the government’s recent measures have done little to boost sales growth and buyers are still cautious of spending while there is a trust deficit in lending money to dealers.The dismal sales numbers come in a week when company executives and government officials are expected to discuss the stress in the sector at SIAM’s annual conference in New Delhi on Thursday - one of the industry’s biggest gatherings in India.Analyst IHS Markit has slashed its 2019 growth forecast for India and expects car sales to fall by 11% for the year.“It is not just lack of buyer interest but a loop of negative sentiment with automakers cutting jobs and production,�� said Puneet Gupta, associate director at IHS Markit, noting that his initial forecast for 2019 had been growth in sales of 5%.Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS, India's biggest car maker by market share, reported a 36% drop in passenger vehicle wholesales for August and has also slashed production for the month by about a third. Tata Motors, which reported a 58% decline in sales of passenger vehicles and 45% decline in sales of trucks to dealers to help them reduce their inventory, plans to offer discounts in the festive season starting this month to boost sales.	-0.2812191229
TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co plans to spend about 30 billion yen ($376 million) on a new plant in Thailand in 2014 to diversify production in the wake of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China last month, the Nikkei business daily said on Wednesday.Nissan, which is under pressure to chase Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co in Southeast Asia, plans toput the plant onstream with an annual output of around 100,000 vehicles, including 1-tonne pickup trucks and passenger cars, the paper said.Production capacity will later be expanded to an annual 200,000 vehicles, doubling Nissan’s current production capacity in Thailand, it said.Spokesman Chris Keeffe declined to comment on the report.Nissan, which is heavily focused on China, is seeking to diversify production in Southeast Asia to catch up with Toyota and Honda, which both plan to ramp up production there, the paper said.Nissan is behind its rivals in Southeast Asia in both sales and local production capability.Nissan, which had previously planned to jointly produce pickup trucks with Mitsubishi Motors Corp, decided to build the new plant as Mitsubishi’s Thai plant is running at full capacity to meet demand for Mirage vehicles, the paper said.Nissan also plans to beef up its lineup of hybrid cars with five mid-sized vehicles, including the Altima sedan, the Sankei newspaper said.Nissan shares were down 1.1 percent, in line with the Nikkei average’s 1 percent fall.	10.65012279
WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. electric luxury car Tesla Model S was named by Consumer Reports magazine on Tuesday as its overall top pick for 2014, while Japanese models took just five of the top 10 spots, their worst showing in the 18-year history of the annual rankings.The Ram 1500 was named the top pickup truck, the first time a Chrysler model has cracked the top picks list since 1998. In a separate ranking of brands, however, Detroit automakers had the four lowest scores of 23 brands rated.South Korean automaker Hyundai, and German brands BMW and Volkswagen’s Audi had models topping the 10 Consumer Reports vehicle categories.“The competition in the marketplace has grown fierce. There was a time when a handful of brands dominated our top picks list, but in recent years we’ve seen a more diverse group make the cut,�� Rik Paul, Consumer Reports�� automotive editor, said in a statement.The top picks were chosen from more than 260 vehicles tested by Consumer Reports for reliability, safety and road-test performance.The battery-powered Tesla Model S was chosen best overall for its “exceptional performance and its many impressive technological innovations,�� Consumer Reports said, noting it was “pricey�� at $89,650.California-based Tesla Motors Inc, which was founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk in 2003, said it expects to deliver about 35,000 of the model this year. By comparison, the best-selling car in the United States last year, the Toyota Camry, sold about 408,000 in 2013.Consumer Reports hasn’t named a best overall since a Lexus model took the top honors in 2010.Honda and Subaru were the only automakers with more than one model in this year’s top picks. Honda’s Accord won best midsize sedan, and its Odyssey was named top minivan. The best compact car went to Subaru’s Impreza, and its Forester model was picked as the top small SUV.Toyota’s Prius hybrid, with its 44 miles-per-gallon overall fuel efficiency, was named best green car for the 11th consecutive year.The Audi A6 took top honors in the luxury car rankings for the second year in a row, while the BMW 328i was chosen best sports sedan, also for a second straight year.Japanese automakers, which historically have taken more than 70 percent of the top picks, managed to win only five of the 10 categories, the worst showing since Consumer Reports began publishing the list in 1997.Consumer Reports also released its annual report card on car brands. It rates each manufacturer’s individual brands, with a composite score based on reliability and road testing.Lexus, Toyota’s luxury brand, came out on top for the second straight year, with a score of 79. Honda’s Acura was second with 75, followed by Audi with 74.Consumer Reports said of Lexus: “Its models are usually quiet, comfortable, and fuel efficient, and they’re among the most reliable cars made.”Subaru and Toyota tied for the fourth spot. Mazda, Honda, Infiniti, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW rounded out the top 10.Detroit-based manufacturers fared poorly in this ranking, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Jeep tying Ford for worst of the 23 brands listed. Consumer Reports said both Jeep and Ford models had reliability problems.Fiat Chrysler’s Dodge and General Motors Co’s Cadillac were also among the four lowest-scoring brands.GM’s Buick and GMC tied for 12th, the highest rating for Detroit automakers.Consumer Reports said it didn’t have brand report cards for Fiat, Tata Motors Ltd’s Jaguar and Land Rover brands, Ford’s Lincoln, BMW’s Mini, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Fiat Chrysler’s Ram, Toyota’s Scion, Daimler’s Smart and Tesla because of a lack of data.	-2.379304378

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group and LG Chem Ltd 051910.KS are considering establishing an electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing joint venture in Indonesia, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.The investment size and production capacity have not been decided, the person said, declining to be identified as discussions are private.Global automakers are moving to secure batteries in anticipation of a rise in EV sales due to government subsidies and quotas designed to cut carbon emissions.In recent years, LG Chem has set up ventures with General Motors Co GM.N and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175.HK. LG Chem also supplies batteries to automakers including Hyundai and Tesla Inc TSLA.O.LG Group Chairman Koo Kwang-mo met Hyundai Motor Group Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung on Monday to discuss cooperation in EV batteries, including future technology.LG Chem and Hyundai Motor Group confirmed the meeting but said nothing had been decided concerning a potential venture.“Hyundai Motor Group is collaborating with LG Chem on various projects. However, no concrete discussion has been made on a battery joint venture in Indonesia,�� Hyundai said in a statement to Reuters.A battery cell joint venture would be the first for Hyundai, viewed as a relative latecomer to the EV market.

(Adds updated comment from Toyota)TOKYO, March 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday said it was close to agreeing a monthly base wage increase of 1,500 yen ($13.22) for the coming year, which would be half of the 3,000 yen rise demanded by its labour unions.“The details are being finalised regarding a provisional agreement to meet the union’s original request for bonus and to offer a wage increase of 1,500 yen per month for the average union member,�� a Toyota spokesman said.The company added that it was also planning to meet in full the unions�� demand for a one-off bonus worth 7.1 months of wages.The world’s largest automaker said it will announce its final agreement with unions on Wednesday.An increase of 1,500 yen would be far less than the 4,000 yen monthly increase agreed a year ago.The Nikkei reported last week that Toyota was hoping to agree on a deal centred on a 2,000-yen hike in base wages.Toyota is seen as a bellwether for wage talks that take place across the country’s companies in spring.Modest pay awards would hamper Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to stoke demand and defeat deflation.

DETROIT (Reuters) - In an escalation of the auto industry’s war of words over future green technologies, a senior Toyota Motor Corp executive singled out Elon Musk and other rival executives on Tuesday and made a bold prediction for its hydrogen car.Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice president for automative operations, said in a speech that he believed a hydrogen fuel cell car it plans to launch next year could eventually be as successful as its pioneering Prius gasoline-electric hybrid.Carter said “naysayers�� who have spoken out against the technology would be proven wrong and referred to Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc, Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan Motor Co, and former Volkswagen executive Jonathan Browning by name.“Personally I don’t really care what Elon and Carlos and Jonathan have to say about fuel cells. It’s very reminiscent of 1998, 1999 when we first introduced the Prius,�� Carter said at a conference held in conjunction with the Detroit auto show.The comments underscore just how big the stakes are in the race to take the lead in the next generation green car.While Toyota is investing heavily in fuel cells, others such as Nissan, Volkswagen and Tesla are betting on electric vehicles as the next big thing while publically questioning whether hydrogen could ever develop into a practical automotive fuel.At the Los Angeles auto show in November, Browning, who was then chief of Volkswagen’s U.S. operations, ruffled feathers by saying electric was a more viable technology because it was a lot easier for consumers to find electric sockets than hydrogen stations.Toyota’s Carter addressed the infrastructure issue on Tuesday, arguing that the number of hydrogen fuelling stations would grow in time, helped by private-public partnerships such as the one established in the state of California.By placing stations in better locations, Carter estimated that if all cars in California were running on hydrogen that the state’s fuelling needs could be met with 15 percent of the nearly 10,000 gasoline stations currently in operation.Fuel cell cars convert hydrogen to electricity, emit only water vapor and have a similar range to conventional petrol-driven cars.Toyota believes that makes them the best next-generation technology to succeed the hybrid vehicle, of which it has cumulatively sold nearly 6 million since the first Prius rolled off the production line.“Ten years from now, I have a hunch our fuel cell vehicle will be viewed in similar terms. We truly believe it has the same potential as the first Prius,�� Carter said.	-3.599229932
(Reuters) - Chinese automaker Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd 601238.SS said on Thursday it was in early talks with Tesla challenger Nio Inc NIO.N about a financing proposal, but any potential investment would not exceed $150 million.The U.S.-listed electric car startup, which last month flagged an urgent need for more funding, said on Wednesday it was exploring financing and strategic opportunities with Guangzhou Automobile (GAC Group).Nio did not specify the size of the potential funding but earlier in the day Sina Finance and other media reported it was in talks for up to $1 billion, sending its shares up as much as 17% in heavy trade.GAC Group said in a statement that the potential financing of up to $150 million would include funds it would raise itself and not have a material impact on its own finances.It also said that there is “still great uncertainty as to whether an agreement can be reached.�� Shares in GAC Group fell more than 1% in morning trade.Nio declined to comment on GAC’s statement.Nio on Dec. 30 warned in its quarterly report that the company did not have adequate cash for continuous operation in the next 12 months and it was looking for external financing.Electric-car makers are battling uncertain demand in the world’s largest car market as the government rolls back subsidies amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on government funding.Sales of new energy vehicles, once a bright spot in the market, fell 4% last year and officials from the country’s top auto association said on Monday that they expect 2020 sales to stay at a similar level or slightly increase.Nio said on Wednesday the New York Stock Exchange had contacted it after the unusual market activity in its American Depositary Shares.The firm has about lost a third of its value since its 2018 listing and currently has a market capitalization of $4.52 billion.GAC Group operates in nearly 18 markets worldwide and sold over 2.1 million cars in 2018, including those made in partnerships with automakers Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.The Guangzhou-based automaker has been looking to enter the U.S. market since 2017, but put off its plans indefinitely in May last year amid trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.	-0.5139186296
(In next to last paragraph, adds dropped letter to Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner’s name from Carl)March 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has reached a settlement of more than $1 billion with automaker Toyota Motor Corp, stemming from its handling of consumer complaints over unintended vehicle acceleration, a person briefed on the matter said.The settlement could be announced as early as Wednesday, according to the source, who declined to be identified because the agreement was not yet public.The deal, which the source said would include a deferred prosecution agreement, follows a four-year investigation by U.S. authorities. Under the deal, the government agrees to delay or forgo prosecution if a company meets certain conditions.U.S. officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder, Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx and Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, were scheduled to announce a “significant criminal law enforcement action�� at a press conference in Washington at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT)Toyota faces hundreds of lawsuits over acceleration problems, which gained public attention after the deaths of a California highway patrolman and his family that was reportedly caused by the unintended acceleration of his Lexus, which is made by Toyota.The faulty acceleration prompted Toyota to recall millions of vehicles, beginning in 2009.Last year Toyota received approval on a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve economic loss claims, and is currently negotiating the settlement of hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits.The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan first subpoenaed Toyota in 2010, seeking documents related to unintended acceleration and financial records. The office later sought documents related to recalls of steering relay rods.Toyota said it was cooperating in the investigation.“Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in this matter for more than four years,�� Toyota spokeswoman Carly Schaffner said on Wednesday. “During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements.”The FBI, which was also involved in the investigation, is currently probing General Motors Co for failing to disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 12 deaths and that led to a recall last month, a source familiar with the matter said.

* Sees FY op profit at 2.7 trln yen vs 2.5 trln yen previously* Ups dollar-yen assumption to 109 yen vs 104 yen* Nudges up North America sales view, trims Japan, Asia, Europe* Q3 op profit rises 27 pct to 763 bln yen, beating analyst view (Adds operating profit margin forecast, executive comment, regional sales projections)By Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp lifted its operating profit guidance on Wednesday in a widely expected move, as a weaker yen increases the value of sales overseas and makes up for slumping demand at home.The yen’s decline has been a boon for Toyota, which exports roughly half of its vehicles produced in Japan. Cost-cutting undertaken when the yen hovered at record highs in recent years has also helped the automaker’s bottom line.The world’s biggest automaker now expects record profit of 2.70 trillion yen ($22.93 billion) for the year ending March 31. That is 8 percent higher than the previous forecast of 2.5 trillion yen and compares with the 2.762 trillion yen average estimate of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The revised guidance puts Toyota’s operating profit margin forecast at 10.0 percent from 9.4 percent based on the previous projection.“This is the result of our efforts started during the strong-yen era to boost per-vehicle profitability and lower fixed costs,�� Managing Officer Takuo Sasaki said of the margin.For October-December, Toyota said operating profit grew 27 percent to 762.88 billion yen, versus the 690.21 billion yen estimate of 15 analysts. It also changed its U.S. dollar-yen exchange rate assumption to 109 yen for the current year, from 104 yen.In the United States, Toyota’s biggest market, the automaker has outperformed Japanese rivals thanks to a line-up that spans all vehicle categories. Cheaper fuel has hit sales of the Prius and other green models but fanned demand for its Lexus luxury brand, pickup trucks and other high-margin vehicles where Japanese peers have fewer offerings.On Wednesday, the company nudged up its annual sales forecast for North America to 2.75 million vehicles from 2.74 million, while trimming its projections for Japan, Asia and Europe.Company watchers are now awaiting the end of Toyota’s three-year freeze on new factories through March 2016, aimed at preventing unchecked expansion. In the meantime, capacity constraints are widely expected to curb sales growth.Last month, Toyota said it expects its global sales to drop 1 percent this calendar year, dragged down by a sharp decline in Japan, where car sales are dwindling due to the lingering effect of a sales tax hike last April.Shares of Toyota ended 2.4 percent higher ahead of the earnings announcement, versus a 2.0 percent gain in the benchmark index.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New rules enacting President Donald Trump’s reductions in fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles through 2026 moved closer to reality on Tuesday when U.S. agencies sent proposals to the White House for final review.After more than 17 months of discussion, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) submitted proposed rules for 2021 through 2026 model year fuel efficiency to the White House Office of Management and Budget, the agencies said.Final rules are expected as early as late February or March, officials said.The administration of former President Barack Obama had required car manufacturers to achieve roughly 5% annual increases in vehicle fuel efficiency through the 2026 model year.The Trump administration proposed in August 2018 freezing fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026, erasing the increases the Obama administration enacted, but officials will not finalize that proposal.“We’re not going to be flat, as was proposed,�� Acting NHTSA Administrator James Owens told Reuters in a recent interview. “We’re going to set standards that are reasonable and achievable.”Several automakers told Reuters they anticipate annual fuel efficiency increases of about 1.5%, much less stringent than the Obama rules, but administration aides said the proposal, which is around 2,000 pages, underwent significant revisions.EPA said the final rules “will benefit all Americans by improving the U.S. fleet’s fuel economy, reducing air pollution, and making new vehicles more affordable for all Americans.”The administration has argued that the rollbacks are necessary for economic and safety reasons, but California and environmentalists reject that analysis, saying consumers would spend hundreds of billions more in fuel costs.The administration’s 2018 proposal would have resulted in average fuel efficiency of 37 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2026, compared with 46.7 mpg under rules adopted in 2012.The Trump administration’s “preferred option�� would have hiked U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day by the 2030s but reduced automakers�� regulatory costs by more than $300 billion.Trump has sought to reverse Obama’s climate change policy, which was aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.In November, California and 22 other states challenged the administration’s decision in September to revoke California’s authority to set stiff vehicle tailpipe emissions rules and require a rising number of zero emission vehicles. They also vowed to sue when the administration finalized the new requirements.Major automakers - including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - backed the administration’s effort to bar California from setting tailpipe standards.	0.5668771527

* European car sales fell 10.3 pct in March vs year ago -ACEA* Peugeot, Toyota led March sales declines -ACEA* Retail incentives rose in Jan-Feb -dataPARIS, April 17 (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen and Toyota led European car sales 10.3 percent lower in March, as the unrelenting market contraction spread north, unnerving automakers.Registrations dropped to 1.35 million cars last month, according to data published by the Association of European Carmakers on Wednesday.That completed a near-10 percent decline for the first quarter that has prompted industry CEOs to trim their 2013 sales outlooks and prepare the ground for possible profit warnings.Defying earlier industry predictions of a second-half rebound, European car sales are headed for a sixth straight annual decline to a two-decade low, threatening to undermine the best-laid turnaround plans and survival strategies.While struggling Peugeot was among March’s worst casualties, with a further 16.3 percent sales slump it can ill afford, European No. 1 Volkswagen AG posted a 15 percent decline for its namesake brand compared with a year ago as the German market shrank even more sharply.Domestic sales are “still a critical driver of German (carmaker) earnings and the current trend is quite disturbing��, Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said in a note this week.“The risk is that Europe remains structurally very weak for many years.”It is a worrying prospect, and not just for Peugeot - which is cutting 8,000 jobs and a domestic plant to stay afloat. Chief Executive Philippe Varin says the outlook has worsened since the company forecast a European market decline this year of between 3 and 5 percent.Ford Motor Co, also scrapping European plants and thousands of jobs, lost more ground as its sales tumbled 15.9 percent in March, eroding its quarterly market share to 7.3 percent from 8.2 percent.Daimler AG, whose Mercedes-Benz cars have gained on BMW and VW’s Audi so far this year, has nonetheless cautioned that it may have to trim 2013 profit expectations.Mercedes sales bucked the decline with a 0.8 percent monthly gain, while the BMW brand fell 4.5 percent and Audi dropped 8.6 percent.Fiat SpA also put up resistance with a modest 1.2 percent slide in group sales. That has not stopped CEO Sergio Marchionne from warning that its loss-making European operations may be further weakened by a drawn-out slump.Toyota’s 16.6 percent registrations decline in March compared with a year ago was worsened by a bigger drop in sales of its upscale Lexus models.With no rock bottom in sight, cut-throat price competition can only toughen, piling up more losses for automakers in the region.Average retail sales incentives in the top five markets - Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain - rose 13 percent to almost 2,400 euros ($3,200) per vehicle among volume automakers in January-February, according to industry data seen by Reuters.South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co, among the biggest mass-market gainers last year, sounded a cautionary note even after lifting its combined market share with affiliate Kia Motors Corp by another half-point to 6.2 percent in the first quarter.Hyundai is sticking to a more modest 2013 goal of defending its existing share of European sales, the brand’s regional boss, Allan Rushforth, said in an emailed statement.“No company is immune to the challenges facing the industry, so we’re pleased to have maintained our momentum,�� he said.	14.02471789
HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Flying cars are almost a thing. Toyota Motor is investing close to $400 million in Joby Aviation, a startup that wants to cut commutes by floating over congestion. China’s Geely is backing rival Volocopter; Hyundai is collaborating with Uber Elevate. But an investment by a $232 billion automaker lends much cred to what was once a metaphor for the impossible. New technology has put air taxis within reach, and regulators are wrapping their heads around the idea. The trick is finding customers.The hardware is in place, thanks to advances in software and materials. A 2019 catalogue of so-called vertical take-off and land craft, or VTOL, lists more than 250 electric models for sale. Engineers have conducted successful test flights in Singapore and San Francisco. Last month, the European Aviation Safety Agency approved Volocopter’s designs. Proponents say that compared to the helicopter, flying cars are easier to control, plus cleaner and quieter �� qualities aviation regulators appreciate. Ambitious companies hope to launch commercial products and services in the next two years.The final barrier is profit. Carmakers like Toyota can add value by helping the engineers produce at scale. But demand looks limited. Early targets are wealthier passengers making point-to-point trips over low-density urban areas, in places where the ground infrastructure is clogged. Use cases include short airport transfers, for example, or quick hops between islands.There are other potential applications in cargo and agriculture. China’s EHang, which listed on the Nasdaq in December, has multiple revenue streams including the sale of autonomous passenger vehicles and aerial drone display services. But its prospectus recorded a net loss of $6.7 million in the first nine months of 2019. Other startups are similarly unprofitable, according to an analysis by PitchBook.Today’s flying cars may be variations of the helicopter, but that industry was worth less than $50 billion in 2018 including military craft, according to Fortune Business Insights. Refinitiv data shows Airbus Helicopters, one of the few that publishes financials, posted negative EBITDA for three years ending in 2018.The pursuit of clean vehicles is straining carmaker’s finances. Flying cars are fun, but until consumers climb aboard, investors might get taken for a ride.	-5.990493499
DETROIT (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry in April rebounded sharply from a bitter and extended winter, with car sales rising 8 percent from the previous year.Six of the top seven automakers reported year-to-year sales gains on Thursday, but only four topped analysts�� expectations.The industry delivered 1.39 million cars in April, up 8 percent from the previous year, according to research firm Autodata Corp.Tapping consumer demand that began to increase as the bad weather broke in late March, General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS beat expectations, with Toyota and Nissan both posting double-digit increases.Chrysler Group LLC, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FIA.MI, also registered a double-digit sales gain in April, but narrowly missed expectations, as did Ford Motor Co F.N whose April sales slipped 1.0 percent. Honda Motor Co 7267.T, up 1 percent, also missed.“Sales momentum from March rolled into April, pushing the industry to its best back-to-back monthly sales pace since the fall of 2007,�� said Bill Fay, general manager of Toyota brand.Toyota group sales, including the Lexus and Scion brands, totaled 199,660, up 13 percent. Nissan sales, including Infiniti, were a record 103,934, up 18 percent. Honda sales, including Acura, were 132,456.Chrysler said U.S. auto sales rose 14 percent to 178,652. GM said sales increased 7.0 percent to 254,076. Ford sales fell to 211,126.Combined Hyundai and Kia sales in April climbed 8 percent to 119,783.April was seen as a second strong month in a row, after the cold and snowy weather in January and February dampened car buyers�� enthusiasm.“The economy continues to strengthen,�� said Kurt McNeil, head of GM’s U.S. sales operations. “Retail demand was steady in April, and truck sales and transaction prices were especially strong.”The industry sold cars at an annual rate of 16.04 million in April, according to Autodata. Economists polled earlier by Reuters expected the industry’s annual sales rate in April to come in at 16.2 million vehicles, which would be slightly slower than March.Negative publicity over GM’s recall earlier this year of 2.6 million vehicles linked to 13 deaths does not appear to have had a significant impact on the company’s image or the appeal of its brands to U.S. consumers, said Larry Dominique, executive vice president at industry researcher TrueCar.The GM recall, for which the automaker took a $1.3-billion writedown in the first quarter, is “almost a bigger industry story than a consumer story,�� Dominique said.All four of GM’s U.S. brands reported year-to-year increases in April. Chevrolet and Cadillac were each up 5.0 percent, Buick jumped 12 percent, and GMC rose 13 percent.Sales at both the Ford and Lincoln brands declined in April - Ford down 0.3 percent and Lincoln off 11 percent.Sales at Chrysler’s Jeep line, which is to be the primary global brand of a merged Fiat and Chrysler expected later this year, rose 52 percent in April from a year earlier.Jeep U.S. sales of 205,593 in the first four months of the year were 46 percent higher than a year earlier. Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne has set a target of 1 million sales globally for Jeep for the year.Sales of large pickups remained strong in April, driven by hefty discounts from manufacturers and dealers.Chrysler’s Ram truck sales rose 17 percent to 36,674. Ford’s best-selling F-series pickup climbed 7.0 percent to 63,387, the best April tally since 2006. GM’s Chevrolet Silverado jumped 9 percent to 42,755.Two of the best-selling green cars in the country, the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt, have had mixed results this year, although sales for both picked up in April.The battery-powered Leaf saw sales rise 8 percent to 2,088, with year-to-date sales up 33 percent to 7,272. Sales of the Volt gasoline-electric hybrid were up 19 percent in April to 1,548, but year-to-date sales are off 7 percent to 5,154.Sales among smaller manufacturers were mixed.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. new vehicle sales in July continued to show signs of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Monday posted its lowest sales decline since the COVID-19 outbreak slammed the sector in mid-March.The Japanese automaker said that its sales in July fell 19% versus the same month in 2019, to 169,484 units. That was Toyota’s best month since before the pandemic shuttered North American production for two months and led to closed showrooms across numerous U.S. states.The rebound in U.S. auto sales since hitting a bottom in April has seen major automakers scramble to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships, especially in states where they remained open throughout the shutdowns.The rebound in sales, though, could be threatened by spiking cases in southern and southwestern U.S. states, which have increased uncertainty over the U.S. economic recovery.Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS reported a modest year-on-year 0.6% gain in U.S. sales for July, selling 57,677 units. “Achieving an overall sales increase despite the ongoing pandemic is a tremendous accomplishment and speaks to the depth and quality of our product lineup and resiliency of our dealers,�� Hyundai’s North American sales chief, Randy Parker, said in a statement.	5.727768286
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Tuesday with a Saudi Arabian government agency to conduct a feasibility study into producing vehicles and parts in the Middle Eastern nation.The move, if firmed up, would be a big step for the Saudi economy as the government tries to diversify beyond oil exports and create jobs as part of the kingdom’s 2030 Vision.So far, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf oil exporters have failed to significantly develop industries such as automaking because they lack broad industrial bases and a skilled local workforce.“The study would take into account the evaluation of development of a local supply base using materials produced by major Saudi companies like Sabic, Maaden, Petro Rabigh, and other major industrial companies in the kingdom,�� the official Saudi state news agency reported.The MOU is with Saudi Arabia’s National Industrial Clusters Development Program (NICDP).Meanwhile, state-run Saudi Aramco has signed MOUs with five Japanese entities during a business forum that both nations hosted on Tuesday, coinciding with a visit by Saudi Arabia’s King Salman this week.Saudi Aramco and Japan's biggest oil refiner JX Nippon Oil &amp; Energy 5020.T agreed to consider a refinery joint venture in a third country and cooperation in trading and technology of oil and petrochemical products.Aramco also agreed to consider a possible future cooperation in crude oil supply and downstream business with Idemitsu Kosan Co 5019.T.In addition, Aramco and state-run Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC) formally agreed to expand crude storage capacity in Japan by 300,000 kilolitres (about 1.9 million barrels) from the current 6.3 million barrels from April 1.Japan treats crude oil stored by Aramco as quasi-government oil reserves, counting half of the barrels stored by Aramco as national crude reserves.Companies and government organizations in both nations signed a total of 20 MOUs on Tuesday, including cooperation between the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) and Japan's three megabanks - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 8306.T, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group 8316.T and Mizuho Financial Group 8411.T - on increasing investments in the kingdom.The MOUs also included cooperation in seawater desalination.	-6.287530908

BEIJING, April 21 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co Ltd,, which is backed by U.S. investor Warren Buffett, on Tuesday reported a 41.9% drop in 2019 net profit as China’s EV subsidies cut hit customer demand.BYD reported 1.61 billion yuan ($227 million) net profit in 2019, down from 2.78 billion yuan in 2018. Its revenue dropped 1.78% to 127.74 billion yuan last year, from 130.05 billion yuan a year earlier.The Shenzhen-based car company, which has partnerships with Japan’s top automaker Toyota and German Daimler’s partner in China, sold 461,399 vehicles in 2019, 11.4% lower from a year earlier.It said in a stock exchange filing that China’s subsidy cut on electric vehicles and emission rule changes caused the sales slide in the world’s biggest auto market.In 2019, China’s overall auto market dropped 8.2% from a year earlier while sales for new energy vehicles, which include battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, fell 4%.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - A Houston trial lawyer who won a multi-million dollar verdict against Merck &amp; Co over its Vioxx painkiller has been tapped to lead the first personal injury case in nationwide litigation against Toyota Motor Corp for the unintended acceleration of its vehicles.Mark Lanier, 52, was selected last week by Leiff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein and Conley Griggs Partin, the lead plaintiffs firms in the personal injury case, to represent the estate of Ida St. John, who crashed her Camry into a school gymnasium and broke her vertebrae in 2009.The multidistrict litigation against the Japanese car giant consolidates roughly 155 personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits before a federal judge in California.St. John’s is the first of the personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits expected to go to trial in November and could determine the fate of the other cases before Judge James Selna, who is overseeing the cases.In December, Toyota agreed to pay roughly $1.1 billion to settle related economic damage claims, but the agreement left the personal injury and wrongful death cases unresolved.St. John claimed in 2010 that her car abruptly accelerated while she turned into an elementary school driveway in Columbus, Georgia. She said she could not stop the vehicle despite stepping on the brakes.St. John blamed “defective�� Toyota equipment, including a sticky accelerator pedal, for the mishap, and sought damages of at least $75,000 before she died last summer.Toyota, which chose to try the St. John case first, said in court records that St. John, who was 84 years old at the time of the accident, may have been negligent and that Toyota was in no way liable.Lanier said in an interview that he plans to show that defective Toyota equipment caused the accident and that if Toyota had installed a brake override system in St. John’s vehicle, the crash could have been prevented. Lanier said it is unlikely St. John confused the gas and brake pedals because she had not done so in her 60-year driving history.“All I’m thinking about is how to beat Toyota into submission,�� Lanier said.A Toyota spokesman said a brake override system, which reduces engine power when the brake and accelerator pedals are pressed simultaneously, “is by no means a universal remedy for unintended acceleration, including in cases of pedal misapplication.”Cale Conley, a lawyer with Conley Griggs, said he and Lanier also intend to pursue wrongful death claims against Toyota because St. John’s health deteriorated after the crash.Those claims, without sufficient medical evidence, could be difficult to prove, said Houston trial lawyer Lee Kaplan, who is not involved in the litigation. Kaplan noted that St. John’s age would likely be brought into question.Lanier is known for securing the first guilty verdict against drug company Merck in litigation that claimed the arthritis drug Vioxx caused heart problems.Lanier’s client was a Texas woman who claimed her husband died after taking Vioxx. Lanier won a $253 million jury verdict in Texas District Court, which led to Merck’s eventual $4.85 billion settlement with other litigants.	0.2240841777

TOKYO (Reuters) - Uncertainty over Japan’s economic outlook is “extremely high�� as the coronavirus pandemic hits output and consumption, central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said, stressing his readiness to take additional monetary steps to prevent a deep recession.While aggressive central bank actions across the globe have eased financial market tensions somewhat, corporate funding strains were worsening, Kuroda told a quarterly meeting of the Bank of Japan’s regional branch managers on Thursday.“The spread of the coronavirus is having a severe impact on Japan’s economy through declines in exports, output, demand from overseas tourists and private consumption,�� he said.Japan recorded 503 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday - its biggest daily increase since the start of the pandemic - as a state of emergency took effect giving governors stronger legal authority to urge people to stay home and businesses to close.In contrast to stringent lockdowns in some countries, mandating fines and arrests for non-compliance, enforcement will rely more on peer pressure and a deep-rooted Japanese tradition of respect for authority.The balancing act underscores the difficulty authorities have in trying to contain the outbreak without imposing a mandatory lockdown that could deal a major blow to an economy already struggling to cope with the virus outbreak.Hideaki Omura, the governor of the central Japan prefecture of Aichi, said he would declare a state of emergency for his prefecture on Friday.Omura said Aichi, which includes the city of Nagoya and hosts Toyota Motor Corp, was talking with the central government about being included in the national state of emergency as well, but felt he could not wait any longer to restrict movement.“Looking at things the past week and watching the situation - the rise in patients, the number without any traceable cause - we judged that it was a very dangerous situation and wanted to make preparations,�� he told a news conference.Even with less stringent restrictions compared with other countries, analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan to slip into a deep recession this year as the virus outbreak wreaks havoc on business and daily life.Shares of Oriental Land Co 4661.T fell on Thursday after the operator of Tokyo Disneyland said it would keep the amusement park shut until mid-May.Entertainment facility operator Uchiyama Holdings 6059.T said it was closing 43 karaoke shops and 11 restaurants until May 6.“For the time being, we won’t hesitate to take additional monetary easing steps if needed, with a close eye on developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak,�� Kuroda said.Kuroda’s remarks highlight the strong concern policymakers have over the outlook for Japan’s economy and how companies continue to struggle to generate cash, despite government and central bank promises to flood the economy with funds.At its policy meeting later this month, the BOJ is likely to make a rare projection that the world’s third-largest economy will shrink this year, sources have told Reuters.The BOJ eased monetary policy in March by pledging to boost purchases of assets ranging from government bonds, commercial paper, corporate bonds and trust funds investing in stocks.The government also rolled out a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to soften the economic blow.Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.	0.1701644923
TOKYO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday that it had stopped making vehicles under a joint venture at an assembly plant in Vladivostok, eastern Russia, as a weak Russian economy weighs on the country’s once-booming auto industry.The joint venture with Japanese trading firm Mitsui &amp; Co and Russian automaker Sollers had been assembling Toyota’s Land Cruiser Prado sport-utility vehicle but production was discontinued in late June, a Toyota spokeswoman said.Toyota now exports about 1,030 Prados per month to Russia - about the same number previously assembled at the Vladivostok plant - from its plant in Tahara, Japan, she said.Global automakers have been struggling to maintain sales in the once-promising Russian market. Vehicle sales have halved from their peaks in 2012-2013 as lower oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis fuel an economic crisis.General Motors Co said in March it would shut its St. Petersburg plant by mid-2015 to cope with a prolonged sales slump.Toyota, however, remains bullish, saying it has no plans to pull out of the country. It said its plan to double vehicle output to 100,000 units per year at its now sole Russian plant in St. Petersburg by the end of 2015 was still on track.“There will be waves in the (Russian) market but we as Toyota want to increase sales, not shrink,�� the spokeswoman said.

Dec 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will begin talks to potentially settle hundreds of lawsuits alleging that defects caused some of its vehicles to unexpectedly accelerate, according to a court filing.Thursday’s order from U.S. District Judge James Selna in California federal court put a halt to the lawsuits while lawyers for Toyota and the plaintiffs try to resolve the cases. A similar process will be established for cases in California state court, Toyota said.Toyota is facing hundreds of lawsuits over acceleration issues, which prompted the Japanese automaker to recall millions of vehicles starting in 2009.The settlement process, which is open to all plaintiffs, is slated to begin in February, according to the order. It will apply to personal injury, wrongful death and property damage lawsuits arising from the alleged acceleration issues.Cases that do not settle during the initial process will proceed to formal mediation and, if not resolved, will go to trial, the order said.A spokeswoman for Toyota, Carly Schaffner, said the company stood behind the safety and quality of its vehicles.“In our view, the process will bring greater efficiency to the resolution of pending cases and provide a clear path forward for those claims that cannot be resolved outside of trial,�� she said in an emailed statement.Elizabeth Cabraser, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, called the order “an encouraging step, and at an appropriate time in the litigation.”Toyota has been hit with more than 200 proposed class action and 500 individual lawsuits alleging personal injuries or property damage caused by the alleged acceleration problems, according to a regulatory filing from the company.A handful of cases have gone to trial so far. The first federal trial in Brooklyn ended in a win for Toyota in 2011. The second, in California state court, resulted in jurors absolving Toyota of liability for a crash that killed the vehicle’s driver.The latest trial, in Oklahoma, settled in October on confidential terms after a jury returned an initial verdict ordering Toyota to pay $3 million to plaintiffs.In July, Selna gave final approval to a settlement valued at more than $1.6 billion to resolve economic-loss claims, such as reduced resale value, resulting from the alleged safety defects.The federal case is In re: Toyota Motor Corp Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, No. 10-2151.	0.6321112516
TOKYO, April 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it will commercialise rehabilitation robots later this year when it makes its robotic walk assist system available for rent, joining Honda Motor Co in marketing mobility devices for Japan’s ageing population.A decade after it began developing rehabilitation robots, the world’s No.2 automaker on Wednesday said the system would be ready to hit the market by the end of 2017, two years after Honda launched a similar device.Hospitals and other care providers would be able to rent the system, designed for patients with lower limb paralysis, for 350,000 yen ($3,196.93) per month plus an initial fee of 1 million yen.“The (system) will help to provide assistance to the elderly by enabling them to live more independent lives and to also provide support for their care-givers,�� Toyota said in a statement.Japan is greying faster than the rest of the world, with the number of people aged 65 or older accounting for 26.7 percent of the population in 2015, dwarfing the global average of about 8.5 percent.Demand for aged-care services has boomed as the shrinking working population means that fewer able-bodied adults are available to look after the elderly.Globally, sales of robots for elderly and handicap assistance will total about 37,500 units in 2016-2019, and are expected to increase substantially within the next 20 years, according to the International Federation of Robotics.In 2015, Honda launched a rental service for its mobility contraption. Worn around the waist and attached to the thighs, it helps patients improve their stride.Such systems are a new frontier for major automakers, which are already competing to develop self-driving cars with an eye on the elderly as a major future market.Toyota has invested heavily in artificial intelligence as part of its push into self-driving cars, and has said it may become a maker of A.I. robots to help the elderly.

The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.Japan’s carmakers are passengers in a wild currency ride. Their shares have crashed since Britain voted to quit the European Union. Fears about an economic slowdown and tariffs on UK-made cars play a role, but gyrations in foreign-exchange markets are mostly to blame.At the close on July 4, shares in Japan’s “Big Three�� �� Toyota, Nissan, and Honda �� and smaller peers Mitsubishi, Suzuki and Fuji Heavy stood between 6 and 13 percent lower than on June 23, before Britain opted for Brexit. Mazda, the worst hit, has lost more than a fifth of its value.Those moves actually suggest investors are looking past short-term weakness. Goldman Sachs analysts, for example, have slashed current-year operating profit forecasts for Japanese car and truckmakers they assess by an average 18 percent.Several factors are at play. First, economic uncertainty in Britain and across the continent is likely to dent demand for big-ticket purchases such as cars. Second, British exports to the EU might be hit with tariffs. That would especially hurt Nissan, which has the biggest UK presence. But as the terms on which Britain and the EU will eventually trade are still in flux the impact is nearly impossible to assess.The third and largest effect comes from foreign exchange: a stronger yen, coupled with a weaker sterling and euro. For Japan’s Big Three, the hit is mostly in the form of translating overseas earnings into local currency. Three-quarters of the cars Toyota sells in Europe are also made there. So results reported in yen will fall even if the underlying European business is unaffected.Smaller players like Mitsubishi or Mazda, which manufacture more at home, face a more severe impact. Japanese components and cars have now become more expensive in pounds or euros. So either overseas prices must rise, endangering market share, or margins must fall.There is not too much the carmakers can do about this, apart from hoping that Japan’s leaders will find a way to weaken the yen again. The smaller manufacturers, in particular, do not produce in sufficient volumes to justify the outlay and risk of setting up new plants overseas. The selloff highlights just how exposed the sector is to currency market swings.	16.21567448

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey unveiled its first fully domestically-produced car on Friday, saying it aimed to eventually produce up to 175,000 a year of the electric vehicle in a project expected to cost 22 billion lira ($3.7 billion) over 13 years.The project has been a long-time goal of President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party as a demonstration of the country’s growing economic power.Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Erdogan said Turkey aimed not only to sell the car domestically but also wanted it to become a global brand, starting with Europe.“We’re all together witnessing Turkey’s 60-year-old dream become reality,�� he said, referring to failed plans in the past to build a fully home-produced car. “When we see this car on roads around the whole world, we will have reached our goal.”Following his speech, a red SUV model of the car and another grey sedan one were raised onto the stage, sporting the TOGG label of the consortium that is building them.Erdogan said the charging infrastructure for electric cars would be ready nationwide by 2022.Turkey is already a big exporter to Europe of cars made domestically by firms such as Ford F.N, Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI, Renault RENA.PA, Toyota 7203.T and Hyundai 005380.KS.The new project, launched in October, will receive state support such as tax breaks, and establish a production facility in the automotive hub of Bursa in northwest Turkey, according to a presidential decision in the country’s Official Gazette.Five models of the car will be produced, the statement said, adding the government had guaranteed to buy 30,000 of the vehicles by 2035.Erdogan first revealed plans in November 2017 here to launch a car made entirely in Turkey by 2021.The consortium, called Turkey's Automobile Initiative Group (TOGG), was established in mid 2018 by five industrial groups: Anadolu Group, BMC, Kok Group, mobile phone operator Turkcell TCELL.IS and Zorlu Holding, the parent of TV maker Vestel VESTL.IS.TOGG’s CEO is former Bosch executive Gurcan Karakas and its chief operating officer is Sergio Rocha, former General Motors Korea chief executive. It said it would begin production in 2022 with compact SUVs.In October, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE said it had postponed a final decision on whether to build a car plant in Turkey amid international criticism of an October Turkish military operation in Syria.($1 = 5.9339 liras)	-0.1557191393
BUENOS AIRES, Aug 31 (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker General Motors Co will halt its production line in Argentina for four days during September due to weak demand from Brazil, the main buyer of Argentine-made vehicles, a company spokesman said on Monday.The reduced output spells more trouble for Argentina’s auto industry, which is battling a slump in orders from recession-hit Brazil and struggles to import parts because of a squeeze on dollars in Latin America’s No. 3 economy.“GM has decided to suspend production for four days during the month of September,�� GM said in a statement. “The objective is to adjust to Brazil’s current demand.”GM is not the first carmaker operating in Argentina to reduce production runs or scaleback workers�� shifts. Other manufacturers, including factories assembling electronic goods, have been hurt by the dollar shortage.Car production in Argentina fell 8.3 percent in July compared with the same month a year earlier, and 16.4 percent against June, the ADEFA association of vehicle makers said. July vehicle exports fell 9.4 percent on the previous year.Car makers operating in Argentina include Ford Motor Co , Honda Motor Co Ltd, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG, Peugeot SA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

TOKYO, March 14 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is set to raise base monthly salaries by more than 1,300 yen ($12.18) for the year beginning April, local media reported, which would mark the fifth straight year the automaker lifted workers�� pay.However, the increase is less than the 3,000 yen demanded by its union. Toyota, considered a bellwether in the country’s annual wage negotiations, will announce the figures later on Wednesday.A Toyota spokeswoman declined to say by how much the automaker planned to raise workers�� monthly pay, but added it was considering raising wages and other benefits, such as family allowances, so that all unionised workers would on average get a 3.3 percent -- or 11,700 yen -- boost in monthly payment.Big Japanese companies will announce annual wage hikes on Wednesday, and while workers will probably get more than last year’s 2 percent, and possibly the most in years, they will likely fall short of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s goal of a 3 percent hike.The results of the “shunto�� spring wage negotiations between corporate managements and unions, announced by the big automobile and electronics companies, will set the tone for wage hikes across the nation and could provide hints about future consumer spending.Abe has been campaigning for a 3 percent gain to spur consumption and banish the deflation that has dogged Japan’s economy for nearly two decades. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has also urged a 3 percent raise to nudge up inflation to the BOJ’s long elusive 2 percent target.	-1.130769231
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T is considering pulling out of South Korea, the Financial Times reported on Friday, as political and trade tensions between Japan and South Korea have caused sales of Japanese products in the neighboring country to plummet.Nissan and other Japanese firms have been a casualty of consumer boycotts of products ranging from cars to beer in South Korea, triggered by sudden export curbs by Tokyo earlier this year as trust between the two countries has eroded over wartime issues.Citing unnamed sources, the FT said that besides stopping sales in South Korea, Nissan is also mulling its involvement in an assembly plant in Busan owned by Renault Samsung Motors Co, a joint venture with Nissan's French automaking partner Renault SA RENA.PA. The plant makes cars mainly for export markets.Nissan spokespeople in South Korea and Japan declined to comment on the report.Japan’s second-biggest automaker has been trying to strengthen governance, slash costs and boost flagging profitability amid persistent allegations of financial misconduct stemming from former chairman Carlos Ghosn’s 20-year reign.Nissan's market share in South Korea has long lagged its domestic rivals. Along with its luxury Infiniti brand, the automaker has sold just 3,581 cars in the country in January-August this year, down 27% from a year ago and trailing far behind Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co said on Thursday it would open its third U.S. research lab in Ann Arbor, Michigan in June for the study of artificial intelligence, robotics and materials science to spur the development of self-driving cars.The Japanese automaker already has a research lab in the Silicon Valley technology hub of Palo Alto, where it works with Stanford University, and another in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where it collaborates with MIT. Its new facility near the University of Michigan will have a staff of about 50 employees.The world’s top-selling automaker announced in November that it would invest $1 billion in research and development over the next five years in artificial intelligence technologies, which are critical to the computer brains of self-driving cars.Toyota’s investment in R&amp;D comes as competition in the fast-moving field of autonomous vehicles expands beyond carmakers in Asia, Europe and the United States to non-traditional sources such as Alphabet’s Google and Apple.The new Ann Arbor facility will focus primarily on fully autonomous driving, in which the car takes full control, the company said. The Palo Alto lab will concentrate on what Toyota calls “guardian angel�� driving, in which the car assists for safety functions, but the driver is always engaged at the wheel. The Cambridge lab will focus on simulation and deep learning.Some 30 projects are already underway with researchers at Stanford and MIT, Toyota said, adding that it would continue to collaborate with other automakers, suppliers, technology companies and universities to jointly develop autonomous technologies.The CEO of the Toyota Research Institute, Gil Pratt, announced the move at the GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California.	1.937214385

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia began courting Toyota two years ago to build a large car plant as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s grand plan to wean the kingdom off oil revenues and create jobs for young Saudis.But the Japanese carmaker has rebuffed Riyadh’s overtures following talks that dragged on without tangible results because high labor costs, a small domestic market and a lack of local supplies gave Toyota pause for thought, four sources said.Securing a deal with a major automaker by 2020 for a car plant is a key target in the Gulf state’s national industrial strategy, part of a broader agenda to diversify the economy of the world’s largest oil exporter.Failure to do so would be a setback for Prince Mohammed, coming after the listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco was shelved and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi tarnished the kingdom’s image.“Nobody would say ‘No, full stop�� ... but they politely conveyed they’re not interested,�� said an industry source familiar with the Toyota talks.Toyota said it could not comment on the current internal discussions and communication with the Saudi government.Saudi Arabia’s ministry of energy, industry and mineral resources and the government media office did not respond to requests for comment.As part of measures designed to create 1.6 million manufacturing and logistics jobs by 2030, Prince Mohammed wants to localize half the production of imported vehicles and weapons - which are expected to account for up to $100 billion in spending by Saudi government entities and consumers by 2030.Under the deal Toyota signed in March 2017, the Japanese company agreed to conduct a feasibility study for an industrial project to make vehicles and car parts in the kingdom.Two sources familiar with the matter said Toyota concluded after the study and negotiations that Saudi Arabia would need to provide huge subsidies for the project to be viable.“They found that production costs will be similar to other countries only if there is a 50% government incentive. But even then, they aren’t sure it will be profitable,�� said one source with knowledge of the negotiations.(GRAPHIC: Saudi Arabia GDP breakdown - tmsnrt.rs/2WDjAZb )When it comes to establishing manufacturing, Riyadh hopes to replicate its 1980s push into petrochemicals - the cornerstone of an industrial drive that turned Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) into the world’s fourth biggest petrochemicals firm.Hundreds of thousands of Saudis work in petrochemicals, one of the biggest contributors to the economy outside oil. But it took decades to build up the industry, even with huge government funding and cheap raw materials.Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, is spearheading the drive to localize military spending. It aims to generate $10 billion in revenue over the next five years and hopes to generate 30% of revenues from export markets by 2030.For cars, the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP) wants half the roughly 400,000 vehicles bought each year in Saudi Arabia to be made there by 2030, one source said.But Toyota, which has a 30 percent market share, only proposed a small plant producing up to 10,000 vehicles using imported goods and the Saudis wanted a bigger factory, the industry source and the source familiar with the talks said.A strategy document posted on NIDLP’s website acknowledged that Saudi Arabia had a major competitive disadvantage and state incentives would be needed to create “substantial commercial justifications�� to attract carmakers.It did not provide specifics about the disadvantages, nor the size and kind of state incentives required.At NIDLP’s launch in January, the state approved 45 billion riyals ($12 billion) of incentives to develop an auto sector, including duty rebates, human resources subsidies and tax holidays, but it wasn’t enough, the industry source said.NIDLP did not respond to requests for comment.Asked if it would consider the project if the economic conditions changed, Toyota said: “We do not comment on assumptions about the current and future situations.��(GRAPHIC: Economy by sector in 2018 - tmsnrt.rs/2IUeZbs)The NIDLP is aiming to create 27,000 jobs in the automotive sector by 2030 by attracting so-called original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).One obstacle, though, is the absence of a local supply chain for car parts, three automotive industry executives said.Riyadh would need to build integrated economic districts producing components such as windows, batteries and wheels to lower costs, a senior executive at a Western auto firm said.“If I have to open a manufacturing process in Saudi and then import every single component from abroad, I do not have any economical plus,�� he said. “The problem is not really setting up a plant, but having the entire value chain.”The local market is also relatively small. Demand for cars in Saudi Arabia has fallen by some 50% over three years to about 450,000 cars in 2018, as a drop in oil prices and departure of expatriates hit consumption, said Subhash Joshi, director of mobility practice at research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan.“Saudi Arabia and (Gulf) countries have been persistently disappointing in terms of sales in recent years, so it’s not as if OEMs would be entering a booming market,�� said Justin Cox, director of global production at LMC Automotive.Cox said countries such as Egypt and Turkey had more advantages for carmakers.Toyota has a 1.2 billion euro plant with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles in Turkey, which is in a customs union with Europe. A plant Nissan set up in Egypt in 2005 with a $200 million investment will produce 28,000 cars this year.Cars imported into the GCC customs union which includes Saudi Arabia only attract a 5% tariff, offering little protection against cheap imports for countries trying to get domestic car production off the ground.Turkey and Egypt also provide experienced, cheap manpower while Riyadh has been reducing the number of foreign laborers to create jobs for Saudis, who prefer higher-paying public jobs. Some 10 million foreigners have been doing the strenuous, lower-paid jobs largely shunned by the 20 million nationals.Khalid al-Salem, who oversees the development of industrial cities, said the authorities were working on incentives to lure Saudis to industrial jobs instead of retail, where entry requirements are easier and pay is higher. He did not elaborate.It’s not the first time Saudi Arabia has attempted to lure automakers.In 2012, Jaguar Land Rover signed a deal to explore producing 50,000 Land Rovers a year in the kingdom at a cost of 4.5 billion riyals ($1.2 billion), but it never moved forward.The industry source said the British luxury brand, owned by India’s Tata Motors, got a better offer from a European country.“We continually review our global manufacturing footprint. At this time, our focus remains on our manufacturing presence in the UK, China, Brazil and mainland Europe,�� Jaguar Land Rover said in an emailed response when asked about the Saudi project.Two of the sources said Riyadh has also approached Nissan Motor Co in recent years.They said the Japanese firm considered contract manufacturing through a 75% Saudi-owned venture - without the Nissan brand - but the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year meant it was off the table for now.Nissan declined to comment.While Saudi Arabia is struggling to lure carmakers, it does have a truck assembly industry. But analysts say assembling vehicles imported in kit form requires less investment and doesn’t create as many jobs as building cars from scratch.Economists say, however, that Saudi Arabia does have the potential to build competitive industries and create jobs in the mining and pharmaceutical sectors.The state is looking to triple mining’s contribution to gross domestic product by 2030 by focusing on untapped reserves of bauxite, phosphate, gold, copper and uranium.Saudi authorities estimate the country holds 500 million tonnes of phosphate ore, about 7% of global proven reserves and a new mining law to boost foreign investment is being drafted.Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said investment in mining infrastructure would likely have the most direct impact on developing new manufacturing industries.Pharmaceuticals is another strategic sector for NIDLP. About 25 local manufacturing plants produce 30% of prescription drugs consumed now and the government wants to double the sector’s contribution to non-oil gross domestic product to 1.97% by 2020.Suhasini Molkuvan, program manager at Frost &amp; Sullivan, said the target was almost close to reality though a lack of investment in research and development and intellectual property left local firms dependent on multinationals.“Diversity is easier said than done,�� said a senior Riyadh banker. “It might be achievable in 15 to 20 years if they continue to make the push.��	3.96134494

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE third-quarter underlying profit tumbled by a fifth as the deepening slump in European car markets and costs of a technology overhaul weighed on the auto maker's results.Operating profit declined to 2.34 billion euros ($3.04 billion) from 2.89 billion a year earlier, the company said on Wednesday, just short of a 2.35 billion euro consensus in a Reuters poll.Europe’s largest carmaker reaffirmed its goals to increase vehicle sales and revenue for the group in 2012 and to match last year’s operating profit of a record 11.27 billion euros.The downturn in European auto markets cut monthly delivery growth of VW brand vehicles to the slowest pace in eight months in September. VW’s flagship brand even conceded a double-digit decline in car sales across the European Union.“The increasingly worsening economic situation in western Europe burdened the auto industry�� between July and September, VW said in the report.Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW, which aims to replace Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T as the world's biggest car maker by 2018, is saddled with costs to roll out a new car platform, or architecture, to factories to assemble small and medium-sized vehicles including the Golf hatchback and the CC coupe.($1 = 0.7714 euros)	10.55449331

TORONTO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Chrysler Group’s Canadian arm extended its year-over-year sales growth streak in September, selling the most cars for that month in 13 years, the company said on Tuesday.The automaker sold 19,858 vehicles last month, 1.5 percent more than in the same period last year. Year to date, total sales were up 6.5 percent.Car sales edged up 0.4 percent to 3,616, while truck sales rose 1.8 percent to 16,242. Several Chrysler models posted sales declines, but an increase in Dodge car and Chrysler truck models helped offset the drops.Toyota Canada reported record sales for its cars, trucks and Lexus luxury unit, bolstered in part by new models of the Canadian-built Corolla and RAV4. September sales gained 2.6 percent to 17,268 cars and trucks sold.Sales for Honda’s Canadian arm advanced 8 percent from a year ago to 13,964 as sales of its Fit and Accord models doubled from a year ago. Total sales are up 11.2 percent so far this year to 121,890 units sold.	1.644994517

DETROIT, March 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it was recalling about 124,050 Avalon large sedans globally, with most in the United States, to fix an electrical issue that may cause the front airbags to inadvertently deploy.The Japanese automaker said late on Thursday the 2003 and 2004 model-year cars are being recalled because certain circuits in the airbag control module may be damaged by exposure to electrical noise from other electrical components. In addition to the airbags, the seatbelt pretensioners could inadvertently deploy as well.A Toyota spokeswoman said there was one report of a minor injury, but no accidents or fatalities.Dealers will address the issue by adding an electrical noise filter to the airbag control module, Toyota said.About 119,000 of the cars, built at the company’s plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, were sold in the United States, about 4,000 in the Middle East, about 1,000 in Canada and another 50 in China, a spokeswoman said.Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified of the recall by mail, Toyota said.

BEIJING Nov 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 82,400 automobiles in China in October, up 80.6 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Friday.That follows a 63.5 percent year-on-year jump in September and a 4.2 percent fall in August.The sharp rise in sales was due partly to the low base from last year. Last September, Japan nationalized disputed islands in the East China Sea, sparking anti-Japan riots that hit sales of Japanese brands in the following months.In the first 10 months of this year Toyota sold about 719,200 vehicles, up 4.9 percent from a year earlier.Toyota officials said in August the Japanese automaker and its two local joint-venture partners were on track to sell 900,000 vehicles in China this year, up 7.1 percent from 2012.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co's 005380.KS Czech car plant was the first in the central European country to get back to work on Tuesday after a three-week outage, potentially easing some of the strain on the hard-hit economy.The car sector accounts for a tenth of economic output and a quarter of exports in the Czech Republic, and employs 150,000 directly and even more indirectly.All three of the country’s major carmakers have been offline since around the middle of March as part of efforts to curb the coronavirus and authorities have forecast at least a 5% economic contraction this year.Yet while Hyundai's plant in the east of the country returned to work, there was gloomier picture elsewhere. TPCA, a joint venture of Toyota Motor Co 7203.T and Peugeot PEUP.PA, said it would extend its outage to May 4, scrapping plans to relaunch later this week.The country's top exporter, Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Skoda, is for now planning to leave workers at home until April 27.By contrast tiremaker Continental CONG.DE relaunched its Czech plant employing over 5,000 in the east of the country with limited production on Tuesday, having temporarily halted it last month.Hyundai, whose output of 309,500 cars last year was nearly all for export, said it would run two out of three shifts. The down shift will be used for disinfecting operations.The virus’s outbreak has put most of Europe on lockdown and left numerous factories idled. The car plant closures have hit auto part makers along the supply chain.The Czech government has introduced aid schemes for companies and workers hit by measures to curb the virus.The Czech Automotive Industry Association said at the beginning of April that 90% of the sector was crippled by the crisis and a third was forced to halt operations.	-4.959752825

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Rival militiamen battled each other for hours with anti-aircraft guns and grenades across Tripoli on Thursday, killing at least one person and wounding 12 in the worst fighting for months in the Libyan capital.The second outbreak of street fighting within days shows how the government is struggling to contain militias which helped overthrow Muammar Gaddafi two years ago but kept their guns after the NATO-backed uprising.A security source told Reuters that a heavily-armed group from the central city of Misrata had entered the capital in the evening to take revenge for the killing of one of its fighters in a smaller shootout in Tripoli on Tuesday.Gunfire broke out while young people were enjoying a water pipe on the seafront and families were shopping or dining at the start of the weekend.Toyota trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns arrived in several parts of Tripoli, opening fire as they tried to storm the eastern Suq al-Juma district, witnesses said. Panicked diners ran for cover, while drivers abandoned their cars.The fighting killed at least one person and wounded 12 others, a medic told Reuters. One woman was shot in the leg. Dubai-based al-Arabiya television said two persons had been killed and 21 wounded.The Radisson Blu, one of Tripoli’s best hotels, evacuated some frightened guests after windows in the reception area were smashed by stray gunfire, an employee said.Rival militiamen fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) at the attackers from a bridge, witnesses said. Heavy shooting could be also heard in at least three other districts close to the foreign ministry, state television building and embassies. Gunmen were seen loading anti-aircraft guns mounted on trucks near the ministry.The conflict started on Tuesday when rival gunmen battled for almost four hours. Three people were wounded and one, a leader of a Misrata militia, later died - prompting the revenge attack as news of his death spread on Facebook, the source said.A militia on government payroll had initially arrested the driver of a car without number plates and detained him briefly in a security office in Suq al-Juma. He later came back with friends in armed militia cars, triggering clashes.Although embassies and ministries have been attacked before in Tripoli, the capital generally has been spared the violence seen in the eastern city Benghazi, where assassinations and bombings occur almost daily.As fighting spread through Tripoli, residents carrying guns and RPGs rushed out of their houses searching for the attackers. Others set up several checkpoints to stop more militiamen entering central parts of the capital.“They’re stopping any car from Misrata,�� one resident told Reuters, while anti-aircraft rounds flew overhead.Fighters in a Toyota truck mounted with an anti-aircraft gun shouted “Allah Akbar�� (God is great) while driving at great speed near the foreign ministry.In the Suq al-Juma area, residents tore down street lamps to build makeshift barricades to prevent more militiamen entering the area, witnesses said by telephone.Libya’s government is finding it harder to contain former fighters and Islamist militants in a country awash with weapons.Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has sought to co-opt militia that helped topple Gaddafi by integrating them and their weapons from the revolt into the nascent army and police. But in practice, most continue to report to their own commanders or tribes.Strikes and armed protests by militia and tribal gunmen demanding payments or political rights have also shut much of the OPEC member’s oil output for months and deprived the government of its key source of income.	-3.878464317
CANBERRA (Reuters) - The Australian arm of Ford Motor F.N said it will close its operations for almost one week, after a parts supplier was put into administration over rent dispute.About 1,800 workers would be stood down at two plants in the state of Victoria, and production would cease at the close of business on Thursday and would not resume until next Wednesday, a Ford spokeswoman said.“We won’t be producing cars on Friday, Monday or Tuesday,�� she said. “Obviously the whole process needs a bit of time to happen before we can start our production line again.”The shutdown follows the news that Ford’s parts manufacturer CMI Industrial has been put into administration, leading to a breakdown of suspension parts supply.When contacted by Reuters, an executive from CMI Industrial who declined to be identified, confirmed the company had been put into administration.Ford is one of the three car makers in Australia, which, including GM Holden GM.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, are struggling with the global downturn and a strong Australian dollar undermining competitiveness.Last week, Toyota axed 350 jobs from its manufacturing plant in Melbourne under a plan originally announced in January.Australia made about 224,000 vehicles in 2011, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, down by 8.1 percent from the previous year.	-6.367723903
BERLIN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Germany’s Volkswagen narrowly beat General Motors Co. in the global auto sales race last year, finishing as runner-up behind sales champion Toyota Motor Corp..VW group deliveries increased to 9.73 million passenger cars, vans and heavy trucks in 2013, a spokesman said on Thursday, around 5 percent more than in 2012.GM sold 9.71 million vehicles last year, up 4 percent year-on-year, while Toyota said its sales rose 2 percent to 9.98 million cars.VW has pledged to surpass Toyota to snatch the global sales crown no later than 2018, though analysts have said it could meet that goal as early as this year.Toyota regained the top spot in world auto sales charts in 2012, after slipping to third place behind GM and Volkswagen in 2011, following natural disasters in Japan and Thailand. Previously, Toyota had been on top from 2008 through 2010.	-1.010805159
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is aiming to halve the number of car models it sells at home by 2025, a person briefed on the matter said - the second time this month that a Japanese automaker has emerged with plans to sharply scale back in a shrinking domestic market.Car sales in Japan have been on a declining trend for more than two decades as the population rapidly ages and young people are losing interest in car ownership. At the same time, global automakers are increasingly focusing their R&amp;D efforts on electric cars and self-driving technologies.Toyota offers about 60 car models in Japan, where consumers clamor for variety. But it aims to gradually cut that to about 30 by 2025 to make better use of resources, the person said, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.But even halved, the new domestic model portfolio would still beat the 25 models available in North America, Toyota’s biggest market.The plan comes on the heels of Honda Motor Co Ltd’s announcement last week that it aims to end production at a domestic factory by 2022, cutting output in Japan by 24 percent to focus on electric cars and other technologies.Toyota spokeswoman Akiko Kita declined to comment on product plans but said the company was pursuing a number of strategies to maintain sales of at least 1.5 million Toyota-branded vehicles annually in Japan. It currently sells around 1.6 million a year.The domestic line-up for Japan’s No. 1 automaker includes the popular Prius gasoline hybrid and the Aqua compact hatchback, versions of which are also available overseas. It also sells lower-volume models, including the Premio sedan, that are often derivatives of other models.“As Toyota begins to develop EVs for markets including China, Europe and the United States, they will likely focus on making models which can be sold both at home and abroad,�� said Yoshiaki Kawano, manager of Japan/Korea vehicle sales forecasts at IHS Automotive.	2.013150418
TOKYO (Reuters) - Global sales of Japanese automakers slumped 21.3% on-year in June, the fourth straight month of double-digit losses, as most automotive factories and dealerships remained closed during the lockdown, data from the companies showed on Thursday.The country's seven major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T, sold a combined 1.88 million vehicles last month, down from 2.39 million units a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on sales data released by the companies. The decline in monthly sales has slowed ever since a 50% drop posted in April, and compared with a 38% fall in May.Global production at these automakers last month fell 26.1% to 1.65 million units on-year, while there was a 62% slump reported in May.Global demand for cars has been falling since March due to stay-at-home orders in many countries to control the virus outbreak. This led to a drop in visits to car dealerships, while people concerned about their finances also reconsidered big purchases.Many countries have been easing the lockdown restrictions, but industry experts anticipate that it could take up to five years for demand to recover to 2019 levels.	10.96866097
* Bosch says to use money to fund investments, acquisitions* Denso says no change to technology and business tie-ups (Adds Denso comment, background)FRANKFURT/TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - German auto parts supplier Bosch said it sold its 5 percent stake in Japanese peer Denso for roughly 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to fund investments and strategic acquisitions.Bosch, the world’s biggest auto parts supplier, said on Thursday that the roughly 46 million shares it held in Denso, the second-biggest parts maker, since the mid-1950s were considered to be only a financial investment and that they were sold in recent days.Denso spokesman Shuji Kojima said there will be no changes in existing technological and business tie-ups between the two auto parts makers.“We will continue to seek further cooperation within our existing tie-up framework,�� he said.Bosch and Denso, while competitors, have license agreements under which they share certain powertrain-related technologies.They also have a joint venture in the United States that manufactures fuel pump parts, and another one in Japan that produces car navigation systems.Denso is owned 22.5 percent by Toyota Motor Corp.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to slash production in North America by nearly a third through October due to the coronavirus crisis and expects it will take some time for output to return to normal, a person familiar with the matter said.Toyota will build about 800,000 vehicles, including its RAV4 SUV crossovers and Camry sedans, at plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico from April through to the end of October, the person told Reuters.That’s down 29% from the Japanese automaker’s output in the same seven months of 2019 and 32% lower than its forecast in January for production during the period.The source declined to be identified because the information is not public.A Toyota spokeswoman declined to comment on production plans.The drop in Toyota’s production highlights the pain for carmakers around the world due to the fallout from the virus. Besides weak demand, problems with procurement and social distancing measures at plants are also expected to hit output.Analysts expect a slow and patchy recovery from the pandemic to curtail spending while social distancing may also curb the need for some to commute, dampening the need for new cars.Toyota is gradually resuming output at its seven North American sites from Monday.Its production in many countries ground to a halt in mid-March as governments locked down economies, forcing factories to close as workers were unable to commute.The source said Toyota plans to keep May production at less than 10% of last year’s levels - after zero output in April - before ramping up to normal levels in July.By September, monthly vehicle production will be outpacing levels the previous year, as Toyota catches up with lost output.North America is a major production centre for Toyota with the United States alone accounting for about 14% of its global output in 2019, making it the carmaker’s third-largest factory hub after Japan and China.Toyota announces its full-year financial results on Tuesday.	3.553299492

(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce next week it would reopen a review of 2022-2025 vehicle emissions requirements after automakers urged the Trump administration to reverse a decision under former President Barack Obama, a source said on Friday.Last week, trade groups representing General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Ford Motor Co F.N, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and others formally asked new EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to withdraw an Obama administration decision to lock in vehicle emission rules through 2025.A person briefed on the matter who had seen the draft order restarting the review said it was expected to be unveiled next week. The source was not authorized to discuss contents of the order publicly.The EPA notice is expected to say that the agency plans to work in tandem with the U.S. Transportation Department to set consistent standards for corporate average fuel efficiency and emissions limits, the source said.A White House spokeswoman and an EPA spokesman declined to comment.The EPA had until April 2018 to decide whether the 2022-2025 standards were feasible under a “midterm review�� but in November moved up its decision to Jan. 13, just before Obama left office.The auto group requests follow a separate letter to President Donald Trump earlier this month from the chief executives of GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU.NFCHA.MI, along with the top North American executives at Toyota, VW, Honda, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and others urging Trump to revisit the decision.GM CEO Mary Barra told reporters on Tuesday that automakers were “looking to actually have the midterm review.�� She said the review needs to look “at all the different dynamics that are occurring.”Automakers say the rules impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. Environmentalists say the rules save drivers fuel costs and should not be changed.In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.In July, EPA said because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it now estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025.Earlier Friday, eight environmental organizations urged Pruitt not to reopen the issue. These included the Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, League of Conservation Voters and Natural Resources Defense Council.“EPA should stay the course and look to the future, to protect our climate and the workers developing clean car technologies,�� council President Rhea Suh said in a statement.	-3.888052431
SYDNEY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Sales of new motor vehicles in Australia slipped in October, taking a breather after two straight months of solid gains as sports utility vehicles snapped their meteoric run.Government figures out on Thursday showed new vehicle sales fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent in October to 95,720, following rises of 4.6 percent and 4.3 percent in the past two months. But sales were still up a hefty 8.6 percent compared to October last year.Sales of sports utility vehicles fell 3.0 percent to 26,712. Sales of passenger vehicles declined by 3.1 percent, while sales of other vehicles, including trucks, eased 1.6 percent.Industry data out earlier in the month showed new vehicle sales jumped 12.2 percent on October last year. Toyota retained top spot on the sales ladder with 19.4 percent of the market in October.The Holden unit of General Motors regained second spot with 10.7 percent, while Ford recovered to 8.8 percent. Mazda eased to fourth with 8.1 percent, while Hyundai took fifth spot with 7.9 percent. (Reporting by Ian Chua)	7.88686768
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are looking beyond the industry trend to develop self-driving cars and turning their attention to robots to help keep the country’s rapidly graying society on the move.Toyota Motor Corp said it saw the possibility of becoming a mass producer of robots to help the elderly in a country whose population is ageing faster than the rest of the world as the birthrate decreases.The country’s changing demographics place its automakers in a unique situation. Along with the issues usually associated with falling populations such as labor shortages and pension squeezes, Japan also faces dwindling domestic demand for cars.Toyota, the world’s second largest automaker, made its first foray into commercializing rehabilitation robots on Wednesday, launching a rental service for its walk assist system, which helps patients to learn how to walk again after suffering strokes and other conditions.Toyota’s system follows the release by Honda Motor Co of its own walking assist “robotic legs�� in 2015, which was based on technology developed for its ASIMO dancing robot.“If there’s a way that we can enable more elderly people to stay mobile after they can no longer drive, we have to look beyond just cars and evolve into a maker of robots,�� Toshiyuki Isobe, chief officer of Toyota’s Frontier Research Center, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.Speaking to reporters, he added that mass producing robots would be a natural step for the company which evolved from a loom maker in 1905 into an automaker whose mission is to “make practical products which serve a purpose��.“Be it robots or cars, if there’s a need for mass produced robots, we should do it with gusto,�� Isobe said.Japan is graying faster than the rest of the world, with the number of people aged 65 or older accounting for 26.7 percent of the population in 2015, dwarfing the global average of about 8.5 percent.As a result, demand for care services for elderly people has boomed and a shrinking working population means that fewer able-bodied adults are available to look after them.Globally, sales of robots for elderly and handicap assistance will total about 37,500 units in 2016-2019, and are expected to increase substantially within the next 20 years, according to the International Federation of Robotics.At the same time, car sales in Japan have fallen 8.5 percent between 2013-2016, as older drivers stop buying cars while car ownership becomes less of a priority among younger drivers.Like most major automakers, Toyota is still competing fiercely to develop self-driving cars, committing $1 billion to a robotics and A.I. research center.Isobe conceded that it took Toyota longer to develop robots than cars, as it stretched the company further beyond its comfort zone. As a result, Toyota’s new walking assist system took more than 10 year to bring to market.“The biggest challenges have been in determining the needs of the robot market, which is relatively new, and to ensure that our products are safe,�� Isobe said.Still, industry experts said that automakers were well placed to compete with medical technology companies including Switzerland’s Hocoma and robot manufacturers such as ReWalk Robotics of the United States, both of which have developed robotic walking assist systems.“Cars operate using engines and other components which enable mobility and control,�� said Nagayoshi Nakano, research vice president at Gartner Research’s IoT Center of Excellence.“On top of that, many of them have been partnering with the likes of Google and other companies looking at applying artificial intelligence, which will put them in a strong position to compete in robot services for the elderly.��	2.140526013

TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks ended higher on Thursday as a rapidly weakening yen, which hit a near 10-month low versus the dollar overnight, lifted export-focused automakers, but the gains were capped by concerns over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.The benchmark Nikkei average ended up 0.3% at 23,479.15, while the broader Topix added 0.2% to 1,674.48.Both indexes erased most of their early gains on news that two passengers from the virus-hit cruise ship moored near Tokyo have died and 29 people were in a serious condition, analysts said.About two-thirds of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished in positive territory, with mining , transport equipment and paper and pulp being the top three performers.The yen dived to its lowest level since early May versus the dollar of overnight, providing a tailwind for Japanese exporters as a weaker local currency boosts corporate profits when they are repatriated.Toyota Motor Corp advanced 2.8%, while Honda Motor Co Ltd rose 2.2% and Subaru Corp added 2.4%.The Nikkei’s heavyweight SoftBank Group climbed 3.4% after the tech conglomerate said it plans to borrow up to 500 billion yen ($4.5 billion) from 16 domestic and foreign financial institutions using almost a third of its stake in telco SoftBank Corp as collateral.Seven &amp; i Holdings tumbled 8.8% after Bloomberg reported that the retail group is in exclusive talks to buy Marathon Petroleum Corp’s Speedway business.

(Repeats story with no changes to headline or text)BOSTON, April 3 (Reuters) - An ignition switch defect linked to deadly crashes and mounting recalls are raising anxiety in General Motors Co showrooms, according to dealers who increasingly are fielding calls from customers concerned about the safety of GM cars.The Ancira Auto Group in San Antonio, Texas, expected a banner March after a strong February, but it came up 28 vehicles short of its goal of selling 200 cars and trucks, Vice President April Ancira said in an email.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Wednesday endured a withering attack at a U.S. Senate hearing that opened with accusations that the company fostered “a culture of cover-up��, and Ancira said the bad news centered on the ignition switch issue contributed to her group’s sales miss.“It will take some time for the brand to gain back the customers it lost,�� she said. “But I have got to believe that General Motors will use this opportunity to really focus on improving the safety of their product.”Interviews with more than 20 U.S. GM dealerships this week revealed concerns that sales would be pressured, even in a recovering auto market. Dealers also made clear there’s an escalating number of jittery current GM owners, and demands for repairs threaten to clog some repair facilities.“They are calling for information. People are a little confused about what they need to do. There are a lot of these cars out there,�� said Al Belford, fixed operations director at Ed Bozarth Chevrolet in Las Vegas, which has been getting about 50 customer calls a day for the last three weeks.Jacqueline Aguilar, service coordinator at Brickell Buick GMC in Miami, said the dealership handles was getting up to 40 calls a day between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.Holland, Michigan’s DeNooyer Chevrolet has been getting 10-15 calls per day, sales manager Dominique DeNooyer told local television, adding that the dealership was finding the “influx�� of people challenging.Since February, GM has recalled 2.6 million vehicles due to concerns about ignition switches that unexpectedly turn off engines during operation and leave airbags, power steering and power brakes inoperable. And so far this year, GM has recalled a total of nearly 7 million vehicles, or about the same number recalled in the previous four years combined.In January 2010, Toyota Motor Corp recalled nearly 2.6 million vehicles in the United States and Canada to fix sticky accelerator pedals. The recall and the controversy leading up to the decision punished sales.Less than two weeks after the recall, Toyota reported a 16 percent drop in January 2010 U.S. sales. Sales fell again in February before rebounding in March. Still, the automaker’s U.S. market share hasn’t regained its peak of 17 percent, set in 2009.In contrast, GM’s numbers improved in March, the month after the first stages of the recall were announced. Dealers delivered 256,047 vehicles in the United States in March, fueling a 4 percent increase in total sales from year-ago levels. Retail sales were up 7 percent and GM said it gained retail market share.Overall, the auto market is in recovery mode, and a lot of dealership executives, are staying optimistic, including Brad Sowers, owner of Jim Butler Chevrolet in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton.“I’m still in the mode that it’s going to be a good year for us and the marketplace has cars that are 11 or 12 years old and rates are really low,�� Sowers said.“Our sales have been average,�� said James Mardenli, general sales manager at Cerrone Chevrolet Buick &amp; GMC Truck dealership in South Attleboro, Massachusetts. “April should be a good month in terms of sales because April, May, and June are usually the months where the most cars are bought.”But Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a research note that his uncle, a car dealer in Canton, Ohio, was concerned.“I think April’s gonna hit rock bottom for us. We know we’ll get through this, but are just hoping this issue passes as soon as possible,�� Jonas quoted his uncle as saying. Jonas didn’t name his uncle or respond immediately to a call about the discussion.At GM dealerships near the major U.S. cities of Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Miami, and San Antonio, managers agreed they were spending a lot more time allaying customer concerns.They reported offering more rental cars, agreeing to more trade-ins and telling customers to lighten their key chains.Several dealership executives conceded the bad news is distracting their teams from making their sales pitch in the showroom.Some customers, however, don’t want to wait weeks for their cars to be repaired. GM has offered some incentives for trade-ins and dealers say the offer is being taken up.Andy Sweis, general manager at Jennings Chevrolet in the north Chicago suburb of Glenview, Illinois, said the dealership has taken in about a half a dozen Chevy Cobalts for trade-in since the recall.

NAIROBI, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Tsusho Corporation’s African head wants the continent to deliver 30 percent of the Japanese conglomerate’s total revenue over the next 20 years, up from 10 percent now.The trading arm of Japan’s Toyota Group bought French distribution company CFAO in 2012, giving it access to businesses ranging from retail to healthcare across Africa.These businesses have now been integrated with Toyota Tshusho’s own operations, which were mainly involved with vehicle sales, and employ more than 15,000 people.“In the coming 20 years, we should increase from 10 to 30 percent,�� Richard Bielle, CFAO’s group chairman and CEO, told Reuters, with reference to Africa’s contribution to Toyota Tsusho’s total annual revenue of $60 billion.That goal was based on forecasts which show Africa’s population of 1 billion would account for a third of the world’s population by 2050, from about 17 percent now.The Africa division is investing 100-150 million euros each year as it seeks to boost its food retail, production and consumer goods sales businesses, Bielle said.CFAO’s automotive business, which includes distribution of Toyota and Mercedes Benz cars in Kenya, contributes 60 percent of revenue while healthcare, including pharmaceutical distribution, make up a third.The rest comes from its technology and energy, which includes renewable energy generation plants.Bielle said the company wanted to achieve a balance where all the businesses contribute close to an equal share of revenue, which it would do through increased investments.The main risk facing global firms doing business in Africa was the uneven growth of countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, Algeria and Angola, which rely on commodities and whose growth was hit when prices crashed in 2015.“We have seen in the last two years that countries that are too much dependent on raw materials like oil are not able to have sustainable growth,�� he said.

SEOUL, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co said it will lower the price of its Tucson fuel cell electric vehicle by 43 percent in South Korea and consider cutting prices of the car overseas to compete with models from the likes of Toyota Motor Corp.The South Korean automaker - the world’s fifth-biggest when paired with sister Kia Motors Corp - hopes to popularise fuel cell cars in its home market by cutting the price of the Tucson ix to 85 million won ($77,189).In developing more environmentally friendly technology, Hyundai has long trumpeted fuel cell electric vehicles over battery-powered alternatives, but the high price tag and a lack of refuelling stations have been roadblocks to adoption.South Korea has only one hydrogen fuelling station, with another to be opened in the first half of this year and a government goal to increase the number to 200 by 2025.The carmaker said it had sold only 200 electric vehicles so far, including in the United States and to European governments.“A significant price cut in the fuel-cell driven Tucson line of vehicles will allow higher supply volume for fuel-cell vehicles in general by making them more affordable for consumers,�� Hyundai said in a statement on Monday.In December, Japanese rival Toyota launched its Mirai fuel cell sedan with a pre-tax price tag of 6.7 million yen ($56,934). Toyota said on Jan. 15 that it planned to sell at least 3,000 Mirai fuel cell sedans at least in the United States by the end of 2017.Hyundai Motor Group has said it would invest 11 trillion won in eco-friendly car development by 2020 and launch its second fuel cell model by 2020.	3.379357693
WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Tuesday said it will scale back investment in a planned plant in Mexico by 30 percent to $700 million and cut planned annual capacity in half to 100,000 vehicles as it shuffles its production plans to meet market demands.Toyota Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said the decision was made to enable the automaker to produce more of its pick-up truck models, which are in strong demand in the its key North American market.“Our biggest concern today in the way we produce cars in North America �� we don’t have enough trucks,�� Leroy told reporters at the Tokyo Motor Show.“We now can have a hub between Texas, Baja, California, and the new plant in Mexico, and in the three different locations we will produce the Tundra and the Tacoma, which is the best in terms of global supply for the North American market.”He added that the change in plans, under which the company initially intended to build a $1 billion dollar plant, did not alter the automaker’s our long-term commitment to Mexico, saying that it could raise production capacity in the future.In August, Toyota and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T said they would jointly build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant, with Toyota saying it would build Corolla cars at the new venture rather than in Guanajuato, and switch to building Tacoma pickups in Mexico.Spokesman Scott Vazin said the change was not a result of fears that the United States could withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, but came after Toyota went “back to the drawing board on rationalizing our production strategy for North America,�� following the Mazda deal.“We are not moving production back to the United States,�� Leroy said. “We just had an opportunity to develop a new factory with Mazda.“We are not playing any political games,�� he added.U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs to curb auto imports and is working with Republican officials to woo investment in domestic production.	3.032532287
GDYNIA, Poland, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Poland’s new car registrations fell to 32,628 in September, down 22.4 percent year-on-year, the Samar research institute said on Wednesday, citing more restrictive regulation on fuel consumption measurement which came into effect Sept. 1Registrations of cars, vans and small trucks dropped 47.3 percent versus August and for the first time after 41 consecutive months of growth.“The drop in the number of registrations results from the record result in August this year.

TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp trimmed its group-wide production forecast for calendar year 2012 by 1.6 percent to 9.89 million vehicles from its previous outlook of 10.05 million vehicles, in the wake of plunging car sales in China following a territorial row between Asia’s two biggest economies.Toyota’s original production target, which includes output at Daihatsu Motor and Hino Motors, would have made Toyota the first automaker to produce more than 10 million vehicles in a year.The automaker, which earlier on Monday posted a July-September net profit of $3.2 billion, also cut its group-wide global sales forecast to 9.66 million vehicles from the previous outlook of 9.76 million vehicles.	5.440669621
* Toyota, Honda lose marks; GM, Chrysler gain points-study* Gap between leaders, laggards shrank, 2012 study shows* Fewer buyers at Japanese cos familiar with “Toyota Way”DETROIT, May 14 (Reuters) - Auto suppliers�� relations with Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co have soured to the worst level in 11 years, but U.S. automakers have won more trust, a survey showed.The two largest Japanese automakers managed to retain the top two slots, respectively, in an annual survey of suppliers about their rapport with automakers that make cars and trucks in North America.But their scores fell to the lowest point since the study introduced its “working relations�� index in 2002. General Motors Co and Chrysler Group LLC continued to occupy the bottom two slots, but they achieved their highest marks yet.The narrowing gap suggests that the six major automakers in the United States are “converging toward mediocrity,�� said John Henke, president of Planning Perspectives Inc, which conducted the survey released on Monday.Salespeople from 439 major suppliers were polled in late March and early April. There were 564 respondents.About 70 percent of the parts in a car are provided by suppliers, which make everything from seats to screws to sensors. Having good relationships with the supply base can help automakers build better vehicles more efficiently.Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co held their spots at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively.From 2004 to 2008, Toyota and Honda earned high marks from suppliers because of their willingness to work with companies to lower costs. During that period, the three U.S. automakers adopted a more combative approach, which cost them in the rankings.But during the recession, Toyota and Honda offered buyouts for employees, leaving them with a less-experienced workforce, Henke said. The supply crunch triggered by the tsunami in Japan last year exacerbated the problem.“The buyers, the folks who have the day-to-day responsibilities, just aren’t doing the right thing,�� he said. “We’ve had suppliers tell us in a couple cases that they don’t know the Toyota Way. That’s creating some problems for them.”At the same time, Chrysler and GM have adopted a more collaborative approach. The gap between top-rated Toyota and Chrysler, which was ranked last, shrank to 48 points in 2012 from 106 points in 2011.NO AUTOMAKER GETS AN ‘A’Automakers with scores above 350 are considered to have a “good�� or “very good�� relationships with the supply base - much like an “A�� grade. A mark below 250 signals “poor�� or “very poor�� relations. Between those two points is “adequate.”Suppliers are more willing to offer discounts and invest in new technology for their favored customers. They give fewer concessions to automakers that are intractable and unfair negotiators or make last-minute engineering changes that can hurt a supplier’s bottom line.For the fourth straight year, not one of the six automakers in the survey showcased a good relationship with the supply sector. It is possible for Toyota and Honda to recover their lost ground within four years, Henke said.It can be difficult to restore trust with suppliers, but not impossible. Ford, which ranked last in 2007, jumped to the third spot in 2010 at a time when the entire company was restructuring. It has been in the No. 3 spot ever since.GM and Chrysler, the two U.S. automakers that took federal bailouts three years ago, have languished at the bottom of the list since 2008, but have both made strides.Under former purchasing chief Dan Knott, Chrysler made the biggest improvement of any other automaker on the list in the last three years. In 2010, 71 percent of suppliers described their relations with Chrysler as poor. By 2012, that shrank to 46 percent, on par with Ford.Henke projected that GM and Chrysler could continue to improve their rankings over the next three to four years, but only if the Detroit automakers do not slip back into their old ways as some suppliers have noted.“A couple of them said, ‘We helped them out when things were bad; they seem to have forgotten that,’� Henke said.	-4.466750314
(Reuters) - The performance of modern pedestrian detection systems varies widely between carmakers, with high-end luxury brands generally faring better and other models failing to recognize pedestrians altogether, according to a study released on Tuesday by a U.S. insurance research group.The assessment comes at a time when pedestrian deaths on U.S. roads are spiking, with an estimated 6,283 people on foot killed by vehicles in 2018, a year that saw the highest number of cyclist and pedestrian deaths since 1990.Automakers are beefing up crash avoidance technology on new cars, increasingly making the systems part of their standard equipment in 2020 models.Pedestrian detection systems, enabled by windshield-mounted cameras or radar sensors in a vehicle’s front grill, are coupled with a car’s automatic emergency braking system and intended to stop the vehicle if it detects a pedestrian in its path.The study by the U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found that not all systems perform equally well. Of the 19 latest-year editions and models IIHS tested, 13 avoided pedestrians entirely, or at least managed to reduce speeds significantly.While the best-performing cars included luxury models Audi A4, BMW 3 series and a version of the Mercedes-Benz C-class, IIHS also gave its best rating to the Nissan Maxima and Volvo S60.The Chevrolet Malibu, a Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima, were among tested cars that did not reduce speeds in some tests or failed entirely.The IIHS testing scenarios included an adult crossing the road, a child darting out from behind an obstacle and an adult walking near the edge of the road - situations that account for more than half of all pedestrian deaths.All tests were conducted during the day and on dry roads, as those are the only scenarios for which automakers currently commit their technology, said IIHS President David Harkey.“This technology is in its infancy,�� Harkey said in a phone interview. “But let’s acknowledge what the automakers are doing well and encourage them to do more.”Tests by the American Automobile Association (AAA) earlier this month showed more devastating results when the technology is tested at night, a time when 75% of pedestrian fatalities occur.None of the 2019 test cars - a Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Camry - was able to detect an adult pedestrian in the dark.IIHS’s Harkey called on automakers to also develop better headlights to allow systems to spot pedestrians at night.	0.8559919436
(Reuters) - Three major automakers said on Wednesday they were forming a consortium to help draw up safety standards for self-driving cars that could eventually help create regulations in the United States.General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp said in a statement they were joining forces with automotive engineering group SAE International to establish autonomous vehicle “safety guiding principles to help inform standards development.”The group will also “work to safely advance testing, pre-competitive development and deployment,�� they added.Regulators in the United States have been grappling with how to regulate self-driving cars, with other countries watching closely to see how implementation of the emerging technology pans out.Last year, U.S. lawmakers, unable to agree on a way forward, abandoned a bid to pass sweeping legislation to speed the introduction of vehicles without steering wheels and human controls onto roads, but may resurrect the effort later this year.The new group, dubbed the Automated Vehicle Safety Consortium, will begin by deciding priorities, with a focus on data sharing, vehicle interaction with other road users and safe testing guidelines.Randy Visintainer, chief technology officer at Ford’s Autonomous Vehicles unit, said the goal was to work with companies and government “to expedite development of standards that can lead to rule making.”Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked the public if robotic cars should be allowed on streets without steering wheels or brake pedals as they try to set the first legal boundaries for their design. NHTSA’s existing rules prohibit vehicles without human controls.The regulator will for the first time compare a vehicle in which all driving decisions are made by a computer versus a human driver.Concerns are mounting about automated piloting systems.A fatal 2018 accident involving a self-driving vehicle operated by Uber Technologies Inc and two deadly plane crashes involving highly automated Boeing 737 MAX airliners have put a spotlight on the ability of regulators to assess the safety of advanced systems that substitute machine intelligence for human judgment.The new consortium cited as a successful model a standards group that helped create a collection of some 4,500 aerospace standards covering airframe, engine and other aircraft parts.	0.7372214941

TOKYO, March 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday that it will brief the media in Tokyo at 4:30 p.m. (0730 GMT) regarding its management structure, with President Akio Toyoda to attend.Toyota was expected to reshuffle its line-up of top executives as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the plan, as the president tries to dismantle a regimented decision-making hierarchy at the world’s top-selling automaker.	1.962661561
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Wednesday its global sales topped 2.5 million vehicles in the recent quarter, up 0.5 percent as it posted its best showing since 2005 for a second quarter.In the first half of the year, GM’s sales were 4.92 million vehicles, up 1.4 percent. That is behind Volkswagen AG’s first-half 2014 global sales figure of 4.97 million vehicles, up 6 percent.Toyota Motor Corp will issue its second-quarter and half-year global sales figures in August. The Japanese automaker was the 2013 sales leader at 9.98 million vehicles, ahead of VW at 9.73 million and GM at 9.71 million.General Motors sold 2,505,889 vehicles in the second quarter, gaining 8 percent in China and 7 percent in the United States, its two largest markets.GM’s sales have diversified quite a bit since 2005.This year, the United States accounted for 32.2 percent of GM’s second-quarter global sales. That compares with 51.4 percent of GM’s sales coming from the United States in the second quarter of 2005, when it sold 2.6 million vehicles around the world.Toyota has been the global auto sales leader since 2008, other than 2011 when GM was tops. But that was the year Toyota was hampered by an earthquake and tsunami in Japan.VW’s figures for the first half of this year do not include its brands MAN and Scania.	-0.9883426254
TOKYO (Reuters) - Eiji Toyoda, who helped steer Toyota Motor Corp’s global rise and pioneered the automaker’s vaunted production system, died on Tuesday, the Japanese automaker said. He was 100.Toyoda, cousin of the automaker’s founder, died of heart failure in Toyota City, the company said in a statement.A taciturn engineer, Toyoda served as president between 1967 and 1982. He was chairman until 1994 and remained an honorary advisor at Toyota up until the time of his death.Over his career, Toyoda presided over Toyota’s rise in the U.S. market from the launch of the Corolla in the late 1960s to the decision to begin making cars in the United States in the late 1980s.Toyoda was also instrumental in developing what became the automaker’s much-imitated method of producing cars with as little waste as possible and continual quality improvements, a system that became known as the “Toyota Way��.In 1950, company founder Kiichiro Toyoda sent Eiji, a graduate of the University of Tokyo, to Ford Motor Co’s massive Rouge Plant to learn about car making from the company that had pioneered mass production.In a story that is still shared at Toyota training sessions, Toyoda returned to Japan impressed with U.S. materials and machinery but convinced that he could make improvements to Ford’s world-famous production system.“Japan’s automobile industry facilities and engineers are good but our machine tools are inferior. If we can solve this problem, we can manufacture good and economic vehicles that are equal to America’s,�� Toyoda wrote after his month and a half of training at Ford’s major factories.At the time of his death, Toyoda was being treated at a hospital the company had first founded as a clinic for its factory workers in 1938.	2.618709576

TOKYO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Japan’s auto recall enforcement division, whose 16 members work from a cramped office on the eighth floor of the transport ministry building in Tokyo, only found out about safety issues with Takata Corp air bags in late-2008 - more than three years after the company says it first learned of problems.The ministry, which doubles as Japan’s safety regulator, then took a largely passive approach to the crisis unfolding in the United States - Takata’s biggest market where more than 10 million cars have since been recalled - rubber-stamping recall filings by automakers after incidents reported abroad.“We had no idea there were already accidents in the United States, so there was no reason for us to be concerned at the time,�� said Masato Sahashi, director of the recall office.To be sure, Japan’s automakers are not obliged to report overseas accidents to officials in Tokyo unless it leads to a recall. And, while defective Takata air bags have been linked to at least five deaths, all in Honda Motor cars, there have been no reported fatalities or injuries in Japan.But more than half a dozen air bag inflators have ruptured in cars at Japanese scrap yards, officials have said, and one of those incidents, in a 2003 Toyota WiLL Cypha, is being investigated and could prompt a wider recall. There have also been four explosions of Takata air bags in cars that were in use between 2011-14 that led to recalls.Now, the ministry, concerned about a broader reputational fallout for the entire Japanese auto industry as recalls escalate, is finally scrambling into action.Late last month, it set up an eight-person task force to speed up recalls and learn more about why Takata’s air bags can explode with dangerous force in accidents. Honda, Takata’s biggest customer, opened its own investigation into the air bag problems in 2007.The task force is in daily contact with Takata and holds regular meetings with a company representative, demanding information as the ministry weighs up whether to order an expanded recall in Japan - as the U.S. regulator has done - said a person with knowledge of the closed-door proceedings.At the same time, a small group of officials at the powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is in touch with Takata and Japanese automakers about how to ensure the timely supply of millions of air bags to fix those recalled, an official involved told Reuters.“We want to see Takata moving with a bit more urgency,�� the official said.To date, around 2.6 million vehicles have been recalled in Japan for potentially defective Takata air bags, out of a worldwide total of more than 16 million.“NOT A TRUE WATCHDOG”Japan’s regulator has come under fire in the past over a perceived leniency towards an industry that’s a national champion.When Toyota Motor initially chose not to recall its Prius hybrid in 2010 for braking issues, politicians floated proposals to toughen the government’s monitoring and enforcement authority over recalls. Reporting requirements were tweaked, but critics say officials blocked wholesale changes.“There’s no sense of tension between the regulator and the industry here. They’re not a true watchdog,�� said Yoshitaro Nomura, a Tokyo-based lawyer who sued Mitsubishi Motors Corp on behalf of drivers after the company was found to have concealed information about its vehicles for decades to avoid recalls.Japan’s auto regulator outsources the testing for defects to the National Traffic Safety and Environment Laboratory - a team led by nine retired engineers from major automakers. To avoid possible conflicts of interest, engineers don’t investigate vehicles made by their former employers. The agency declined to say whether its staff were investigating Takata air bags.Japan also lacks a U.S.-style class-action system, and lawsuits against companies over product liability are seen as costly and time-consuming, discouraging many consumers from filing complaints.The far bigger U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has also been criticised for a piecemeal approach to the Takata crisis and for its earlier handling of a massive General Motors recall for faulty ignition switches.The flurry of activity by Japanese regulators came after Takata baulked at NHTSA’s suggestion - since upgraded to an order - that it cooperate in an expanded recall, and after Takata’s chief safety officer testified before a U.S. Senate panel.“Japan needs to consider preventative measures and take proactive action to investigate problems,�� said Hiroshi Osada, a professor at Bunkyo University who was an outside quality management adviser to Toyota during its 2010 recall crisis.“If Japan is serious about improving the management and quality of Japanese firms, the related agencies have to be more committed to prevent accidents even before there’s been a fatality. That should be their role,�� he said. (Additional reporting by Chang-Ran Kim, Antoni Slodkowski and Norihiko Shirouzu in Tokyo; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)	-1.597369039
Keselowski charges to Nationwide win at CharlotteBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeCONCORD, N.C. -- In the closing moments of Friday night’s Drive for the Cure 300 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, with an air of inevitability, Brad Keselowski tracked down teammate Ryan Blaney and made the pass for the win on Lap 187 of 200.With frequent cautions giving crew chiefs multiple options and scrambling tire strategies, Keselowski had four fresh tires for the restart on Lap 182. It was simply a matter of time before he passed Blaney, who had gained seven positions with a two-tire stop under caution on Lap 169.Keselowski finished .377 of a second ahead of runner-up Kyle Busch, who got past Blaney for the second spot on Lap 189. Matt Kenseth ran third and Blaney held off Kyle Larson for the fourth position.The NASCAR Nationwide Series victory was Keselowski’s fourth in nine starts this year, his third at Charlotte and the 31st of his career. But before he made the winning pass, Keselowski had a moment of doubt.“Under the yellow (that preceded the final restart), I was confident,�� Keselowski said. “Then (Blaney) took off in those first five laps and I went, ‘Uh, oh.�� I wasn’t holding back, and he was driving away, and then the pendulum swung.“His car seemed to fall off -- whether it was the two tires or just the nature of his car, I don’t know -- but it came back to us. Yeah, when the yellow was out, I would have definitely said I was very confident, but after those first five laps, it swung back to us.”Busch had a one-second lead over Keselowski with 40 laps left, but his winning chances suffered when NASCAR called a caution on Lap 167 after a suspension part came to rest on the backstretch apron.“They were faster than us tonight,�� Busch said of Keselowski’s No. 22 Team Penske Ford. “Just knew that with about 60 (laps) to go that we had a tire advantage over them, and that was going to be the way for us to win the race.“But bizarre debris cautions always ruin those things for you. It’s a shame.”For the first two-thirds of the race, pole-sitter Chase Elliott looked to be the driver to beat.Elliott pitted off-sequence on Lap 18, restarted 19th on Lap 22 and worked his way up to fifth before a cycle of green-flag pit stops put him in the lead on Lap 61.When NASCAR called a debris caution on Lap 68, only four drivers remained on the lead lap -- Elliott, Regan Smith, Brendan Gaughan and Dylan Kwasniewski. That yellow was a godsend for Elliott, who could pit on Lap 70 without losing the top spot.Though Smith took the lead briefly after a restart on Lap 74, and held it through a caution for a multicar wreck near the start/finish line on Lap 74, Elliott regained the point on Lap 83 and pulled away to a lead of 2.5 seconds over Smith as the race reached its halfway point.But varying tire strategies shuffled Elliott backward after Busch passed him for the lead on Lap 146. And after the final restart on Lap 182, Keselowski asserted his superiority and successfully held off the fast-closing No. 54 Toyota of Busch.Elliott came home eighth but extended his series lead to 42 points over Smith, his JR Motorsports teammate who finished 11th Saturday.The Lap 74 accident proved the undoing of Ty Dillon, whose No. 3 Chevrolet suffered enough damage in the crash to force its retirement from the race. Dillon entered the race third in the series standings, but the wreck effectively ended his championship hopes.Dillon finished 30th and dropped to fifth in the standings, 64 points behind Elliott with three races left in the season.NASCAR Nationwide Series Race300 Miles Of CourageCharlotte Motor SpeedwayConcord, North CarolinaFriday, October 10, 20141.

BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is backtracking on an aggressive promotion of three-cylinder engines in China that saw some Buick and Chevrolet models offered only in that option - a move which proved highly unpopular and helped sales slide, people familiar with matter said.Three-cylinder gasoline engines are cleaner and more fuel efficient than their conventional four-cylinder counterparts, and automakers are keen to promote them, particularly in China which has some of the world’s most stringent fuel economy and emission rules.GM went further than competitors, discontinuing four-cylinder versions for many models in the world's largest auto market. By comparison, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and BMW BMWG.DE also offer three-cylinder cars in China, but the models are an option in addition to four-cylinder versions.Many Chinese consumers, however, perceive cars with three-cylinder engines as noisier and prone to vibrating, and sales began to tumble in third quarter of 2018. Last year, GM’s China sales fell 15% to 3.09 million vehicles, its second straight year of steep declines and the lowest level since 2012.The move was “too quick, too radical and lacked sophisticated planning,�� a senior Shanghai-based sales manager at a Buick dealership told Reuters.The sales manager, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified, said his company was among hundreds of dealers which lobbied GM to change the plan at dealer conferences.GM China President Matt Tsien told investors in New York on Wednesday that consumers have been reluctant to accept three-cylinder engines, and confirmed that later this year the automaker will offer four-cylinder engines in certain models currently offered only with the smaller engines.By resurrecting four-cylinder options for key models, the hope is that GM, which reports fourth-quarter earnings later on Wednesday, can regain some of the ground it has lost at a time when the new coronavirus is threatening to sink sales in the first quarter.The outbreak is only adding to pain caused by to a slowing economy, U.S.-China trade tensions, and new emission rules, as well as fierce competition from Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE. SAIC-GM, the Detroit automaker's main venture with SAIC Motor 600104.SS, is seeking approval for four-cylinder versions of two mass-market sedans, Buick's Excelle GT and Chevrolet's Cruze, government documents show.Those two versions are slated to hit the market sometime in the second quarter, two people with knowledge of the matter said, adding that four-cylinder versions of the Buick Verano sedan and Encore GX sport utility vehicle were also under consideration.A Shanghai-based GM spokeswoman said the automaker will continue to offer three- and four-cylinder engines in the future but declined to comment on product plans.	-10.30906012
(Adds GM, Honda sales)DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO, April 1 (Reuters) - The top five automakers in the United States on Tuesday reported higher March sales, beating forecasts and raising expectations April could show an even stronger sales rebound after a long winter.Sales rose 5.7 percent in March to an annualized selling rate of 16.4 million vehicles, well beyond the expectations of 40 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. They on average expected a 2 percent increase for an annualized selling rate of 15.8 million vehicles.Cold weather and snow kept many consumers away from dealer show-rooms in early March. But the second half of the month showed promise that April will be a strong sales month, said sales executives from Ford and Toyota.Ford Vice President of U.S. Sales John Felice said the sales momentum in late March shows “the trend positive heading into April.”Bill Fay, general manager for Toyota brand U.S. sales, said, “We’re optimistic that momentum will spring us in into April.”General Motors Co U.S. sales rose 4 percent, Ford Motor Co reported a 3 percent rise in U.S. sales, Toyota Motor Corp a 5 percent rise and Chrysler Group, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, a 13 percent increase from a year ago.All beat expectations by industry research firm Edmunds.com.No. 5 in the U.S. market for March, Nissan Motor Co , also came in ahead of estimates, selling 149,136 vehicles in the month, up 8 percent.GM’s 4 percent sales gain beat estimates of a 0.5 percent rise. But most of the attention on GM on Tuesday was focused on Chief Executive Mary Barra’s appearance at a congressional hearing on the company’s slow response to defective ignition switches, blamed for at least 13 deaths.Alec Gutierrez, analyst with industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, said it was too early to tell if GM’s recall crisis has hurt its sales, but said that it is possible that buyers may stray to other automakers soon.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see some conquest activity maybe in April or May,�� said Gutierrez.GM shares closed down 0.2 percent at $34.34, after trading higher earlier in the day. Ford shares added 4.6 percent to $16.32. The wider S&amp;P 500 index was up 0.7 percent.Auto sales are an early indicator of U.S. consumer demand for big-ticket items that comes right at the start of a new month, before government reports on retail sales and durable goods. The economy sagged in the first two months of year, as did auto sales, amid massive snowstorms over much of the United States. But there were signs of a pickup since then.The boost in sales may be linked to higher incentives by automakers in March, said Larry Dominique, executive vice president at industry researcher TrueCar. He said incentives rose 8 percent to an average $2,800 per new vehicle sale.Automakers and dealers offer incentives, ranging from discounts to low interest rates, to entice consumers to buy.Honda Motor Co showed a decline in U.S. March sales of 2 percent, to 133,318 vehicles. Although Honda’s sales fell, many analysts had forecast a deeper drop, including Edmunds, which saw a 10 percent decrease.GM’s full-size pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra saw sales of 53,378, up 11 percent. Its Buick brand sales rose 13 percent and its Cadillac brand fell 6 percent.Ford said its F-Series pickup truck sales rose 5 percent to about 71,000 in March and its Fusion sedan sales rose 9 percent to nearly 33,000. Ford’s luxury brand, Lincoln, increased sales 31 percent, led by a 72 percent sales jump for its best-selling vehicle, the MKZ sedan.Toyota’s top-selling sedan, the Camry, increased sales 11 percent to 41,953 in the month, and Toyota’s eight crossovers and SUVs increased sales 19 percent. Sales of Toyota’s smaller cars fell, including a drop of 16 percent for its hybrid Prius, 5.5 percent for Corolla and 24 percent for the Yaris subcompact.Chrysler relied on hefty sales of its Ram trucks and Jeep Cherokee SUV, which both showed 26 percent sales jumps from a year ago.Hyundai Motor Co U.S. sales fell 2 percent in March to 67,005 vehicles.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei average soared 2.8 percent on Tuesday morning to break above 14,000 for the first time since June 2008 as the market played catch-up from an extended holiday, with last week’s strong U.S. jobs data easing concerns over the health of Japan’s biggest export market.The Nikkei .N225 was up 378.71 points at 14,072.75 after closing for public holidays on Friday and Monday. Tuesday's rally took the benchmark above 13,988, the 61.8 percent retracement of its slide from February 2007 to October 2008.A senior dealer at a foreign bank said their buy orders outpaced sell by 2-1/2 times.“We picked up a very decent size buy program out of the domestic accounts,�� he said. “I think smart money domestic (investors) are sellers at around 15,000. They are not going to sell here. The market can keep going.”But he added Japanese corporate earnings “are a little bit crappy ... people are just a little bit disappointed.�� Of the 65 Nikkei companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 54 percent of them either beat or met market expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.A stronger-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls for April, with 165,000 jobs being added and the unemployment rate falling to 7.5 percent, the lowest since December 2008, provided much needed relief to investors rattled by a series of soft data in recent weeks.The United States is Japan’s biggest export market, followed closely by China. A run of soft data from China was also a factor in the recent selloff in commodities and other riskier markets.Japanese exporters led the rally, with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Sony Corp 6758.T, semiconductor equipment maker Tokyo Electron Ltd 8035.T and Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T up between 3.3 and 5.5 percent.Sony was the most traded on the main board by turnover, while Toyota took third spot.The sector was also helped by the renewed weakness in the yen, which has fallen 1.1 percent against the dollar to 99.17 since Thursday.The Japanese currency has weakened nearly 24 percent against the dollar since mid-November while the Nikkei has jumped 62 percent after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began promising to revive the economy with expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, dubbed as “Abenomics��, during his election campaign.The yen’s declines gathered fresh momentum after the Bank of Japan’s April 4 announcement of a radical monetary expansion campaign to end two decades of stagnation.The broader Topix .TOPX index advanced 2.6 percent to 1,183.58.JPMorgan said it expected the Nikkei to trade around 14,150 based on the correlation between the yen/won exchange rate and the Tokyo’s index. The yen hit a more than five-year low of 11.0057 won on Tuesday.“According to regression analysis, the sensitivity in the Nikkei against JPY/KRW movements strengthened since mid-March,�� it said in a note.“While Japan’s stock market was closed last Friday and Monday, the current JPY/KRW level suggests the Nikkei index should be 14,150.��	-1.378359752
* Overall Thai domestic car sales seen at 740,000 in 2016 - Toyota* Toyota keeps its own sales target at 240,000, down 9.8 pct y/y* Says government spending, tourism to lift spending in H2 (Adds detail, quotes)BANGKOK, July 26 (Reuters) - Thailand’s domestic car sales are expected to fall at a smaller-than-previously-projected pace of 7.5 percent this year, as government stimulus measures are likely to boost spending in the second half, Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Tuesday.In January, Toyota said local car sales would decline by 10 percent to 720,000 cars.Thailand is a regional production and export hub for the world’s top carmakers, and the sector accounts for around 10 percent of the nation’s GDP.Car sales have declined almost every month on a yearly basis since May 2013 following the fading effect of a government car subsidy scheme that ended in 2012, plus weak domestic consumption.In 2015, overall domestic car sales fell 9.3 percent to 799,594 vehicles.Toyota, which commands about a third of the Thai auto market, would keep its domestic car sales target at 240,000 cars, or down 9.8 percent from 2015, said Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Thai unit at a news conference.Toyota’s sales in Thailand slipped 18.7 percent to 266,005 cars in 2015.While the sector should get a boost from government spending, strong tourism and new car models, it was not expected to recover soon, he said.“Thailand’s slowing economy, limited purchasing power and global economic uncertainty mean time is needed before we see a recovery in the auto market,�� Tanada said.In a bid to lift the economy, the military government has introduced stimulus measures and ramped up investment in infrastructure.

* German consumer body seeks compensation for VW buyers* Dealers want more information quickly from VW* Fuel efficiency trumps environment concern?* Trust in cars intact, not in company - dealerBy Till Weber and Emma ThomassonFRANKFURT/BERLIN, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Volkswagen must move quickly to recall and refit models rigged to pass U.S. emissions tests to limit the long-term impact to its reputation, dealers and consumer protection bodies say.“To regain confidence, Volkswagen needs to indemnify any consumers affected by damage,�� Klaus Mueller, head of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, said in a statement.“The company must either retrofit all affected vehicles or give the affected individuals the right to retrofitting.”The German group has set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to help cover the costs of the crisis and said that 11 million of its cars could be affected worldwide. However, it has not yet ordered a recall or said which models are involved.Lawyers have already brought class actions on behalf of scores of car owners in the United States.Ernst-Robert Nouvertne, who owns VW dealerships in the German town of Solingen, said how quickly VW refitted affected cars would be critical to reassuring customers, adding that several people had called to ask for information.“Customers are unsettled. It won’t just pass us by without problems. Some customers could switch to a petrol car,�� he said, but noted Volkswagen should be shielded by the loyalty of its customers, at least in its home country.Sven Rothluebbers wrote on Volkswagen’s German Facebook page: “VW must be held fully accountable, but please do not forget that Volkswagen has served Germany with great cars, jobs, social commitment and more the past 70 years!”Steve Young, managing director of auto industry research firm ICDP, said the experience of previous car recalls by other brands showed it could actually bring dealerships more business.Young noted how Toyota Motor Corp had recalled millions of vehicles from 2009 due to some customers�� complaints that their cars were unintendedly accelerating.“It depends on how well they manage the process... in the case of the Toyota recall in the U.S., Toyota dealers were able to reconnect with customers,�� he said.“If the dealer handles it well, they could help customers use the compensation to switch into petrol and sell their fixed diesel model to somebody who knows what they are getting.”However, many dealers are still in the dark.A women at the reception desk of a VW dealership in Frankfurt, who declined to give her name, said she had received many queries from diesel car drivers.“But we haven’t got the ultimate answer because we haven’t got much information from Volkswagen,�� she said.In France, a Volkswagen spokesman said the firm is planning to write to their clients to tell them current models covered by the European Union’s Euro 6 emissions standards are not affected, so people who have recently ordered a vehicle should be reassured.He said clients would be informed as soon as investigations show which vehicles are involved.In a Swedish Volkswagen Golf chat room, consumers were discussing whether or not it will be possible to cancel recent orders, with one person saying he had been planning to buy one of the hatchbacks, but decided never to buy VW again due to the scandal.A spokesman for the Swedish Automobile Association Motormannen said emissions concerns were becoming increasingly important for car consumers.“People want to contribute to a better environment when they’re buying a car. Consumers now feel deceived,�� he said.Tim Pollard, executive editor of Britain’s Car Magazine, agreed: “The actual topic of emissions is a bit of a dry topic, but they (consumers) do understand that it affects the tax they pay and the amount of money in their pocket.”But Ansgar Klein, head of the German Association of Independent Dealerships, does not expect a lasting impact.“The Golf has not got worse. I don’t think prices will fall as a result,�� he said. “Most drivers care more about fuel consumption than emissions. The scandal has not affected trust in VW cars, although trust in the company has suffered.”Dariusz Balcerzyk from the Automotive Market Research Institute Samar in Warsaw said the same was true in Poland.“For Poles this is not really that much of an issue. For a Polish customer, it is still the price that matters most, followed by the car’s brand,�� he said.

* Foreign automakers doing most of the new spending* Audi, BMW and Daimler among the newcomers* Detroit 3 have no short-term plans to boost vehicle outputDETROIT, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Mexican auto industry is about to go on a $10 billion factory building spree, illustrating the nation’s rising economic challenge to rivals from the United States to China.Japanese and German auto manufacturers are spearheading the drive, say parts suppliers and researchers who see more auto factories built south of the border than in the United States between now and the end of the decade.The United States will consume the vast majority of the new cars, but Mexico’s domestic market has rebounded from a long slump, and in a sign of Mexico’s growing global role, auto exports outside of North America will rise faster than those to the United States.BMW AG, Toyota Motor Corp and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz are expected to announce at least $2 billion of deals in the next year or two, according to supplier and other industry sources. That’s on top of nearly $6 billion in announced plants by Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG .U.S. automakers, all of whom have been building cars in Mexico since before World War II, will spend another $1 billion or more to upgrade Mexican plants. And Nissan and VW also are considering expansions at existing factories that could total $1 billion or more, according to sources familiar with their plans.Mexico “is quickly turning into the China of the West,�� said Joseph Langley, a senior analyst at Michigan-based research firm IHS Automotive, pointing to Mexico’s low wages, a strong supply base and a global web of free-trade agreements.Mexican auto exports beyond North America are growing even faster than those within, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. They accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 2.4 million exported last year. Altogether Mexico built 3.0 million cars and trucks, according to Automotive News, compared with 10.4 million in the United States and 2.5 million in Canada.By 2020, Mexico will have the capacity to build one in every four vehicles in North America, up from one in six in 2012, according to IHS.The investment shift has implications for auto jobs and labor unions north of the border, particularly in Canada, which will see a 20 percent decline in production, IHS projects. Output will soar 62 percent in Mexico.U.S. auto production will rise 12 percent, and Detroit-based automakers are expanding domestic production by ramping up the pace at existing factories to as many as three shifts running six days a week, said IHS. By those calculations, Mexico is building more auto plants than in the United States or Canada through 2020.“It’s all about lower production costs and lower export costs,�� said Michael Tracy, principal at the Agile Group, a Michigan-based auto consultancy. “That’s what Canada used to be - the place for low-cost manufacturing and shipping. Now, everybody is targeting Mexico.”Mexico’s economy is seen growing faster than Brazil’s next year, underscoring the success of Mexico’s export-driven model versus regional economic powerhouse Brazil’s more protectionist policies. The promised auto investment could help Mexico challenge regional dominance by Brazil. Analysts are warning of excess Brazilian auto production capacity within five years.Suppliers say the Detroit auto makers, with more than half the production capacity in Mexico, have not signaled any plans to expand vehicle output there. But General Motors and Chrysler this year have said they will install additional engine and transmission production capacity in Mexico.In the competition for jobs with the United States and Canada, “Mexico’s momentum, combined with its increasingly dense and capable supply chain, its persistent cost advantage and its trading relationships may give it a leg up,�� said Brookings Institution researchers in a report released last week.Auto employment in the U.S. South, where Japanese, German and Korean automakers all operate non-union plants, is holding relatively steady at 18 percent of North American auto workers, according to Brookings.Pay ranges as low as $12 per hour for temporary workers at plants in the U.S. Southeast, compared with about $35 an hour for skilled union veterans at U.S.-owned plants. Union workers in Canada on average are paid even more; a year ago, GM Chief Executive Dan Akerson described Canada as “the most expensive place to build a car in the world.”But at around $2.50 an hour, manufacturing wages in Mexico are nearly 20 percent cheaper than in China, according to a mid-year Bank of America study. That study put U.S. manufacturing wages at just under $20 an hour, on average.A shortage of trained engineers and concerns about crime and security may hold back Mexico, according to research firm PwC Autofacts.Energy costs also are considerably higher than in the United States, but they are lower than in China, according to Boston Consulting Group. And because of Mexico’s proximity to the United States and Canada, transportation and logistics costs are lower than for parts coming from China.The largest producer in Mexico, Nissan, opens its third factory next month, the $2-billion Aguascalientes No.2. Nissan built 683,520 cars in Mexico last year, and the new plant will add capacity for 250,000 more, mostly compact models such as the Nissan Sentra for North America and other markets, company officials said.Moreover, an expansion of Aguascalientes No.2 is already in planning, according to two sources familiar with Nissan’s plans. Slated to open in 2016, the sources said, it likely will be dedicated to production of compact luxury vehicles for Infiniti and Mercedes-Benz, which has a platform- and engine-sharing agreement with Nissan.Nissan said it had nothing to announce, while a Mercedes spokeswoman said joint production of compact cars was an option, but that no decision had been made.Nissan also is expanding a complex in Cuernavaca, which will take the automaker’s total capacity in Mexico to 1.1 million vehicles a year by 2020, two supplier sources said.Nissan’s closest rival south of the border is Volkswagen, which opened a complex in Puebla in 1967. A new $550-million engine plant in Silao, as well as a $1.3-billion assembly complex in San Jose Chiapa that is slated to be opened in 2016 by VW’s Audi subsidiary, will raise total VW group annual capacity by 100,000 vehicles to 850,000 by 2020, according to IHS.VW and Toyota are battling for global sales leadership, but the Japanese automaker lags well behind its rivals in Mexico, where it has only a small truck assembly facility in Tijuana.Now, the automaker is scrambling to catch up with its competitors, according to two supplier sources who say Toyota is actively shopping for a site. Toyota executives in recent months have said the company needs additional production capacity in Mexico, without providing specifics. A Toyota spokeswoman said the company “would not comment on any potential plant announcement�� in Mexico.BMW, which operates a U.S. assembly plant in South Carolina, also is shopping prospective plant sites south of the border, according to Mexican government officials.Supplier sources said BMW already has mapped out a production timetable for Mexico, with a tentative plan to begin assembly operations in late 2017, ramping up annual capacity to 200,000 by 2020.A BMW spokesman said he had nothing to confirm.Other vehicle and parts manufacturers are expected to set up shop or expand existing facilities in Mexico by 2020, said Tracy, of the Michigan-based auto consultancy.IHS’s Langley summed it up: “The level of activity in Mexico is insane.��	-3.901767271
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese blue-chip firms announced wage hikes that topped increases last year, but overall pay raises across corporate Japan are not expected to offset higher costs of living or be enough to drive a sustainable economic recovery.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and other major exporters said on Wednesday they will raise base pay for a second straight year amid government calls for help in generating a virtuous cycle of higher wages and prices to decisively end two decades of deflation and stop-start growth.Thanks to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus policies and a weaker yen, many exporters have made huge profits and boast record cash reserves. The raises will likely allow pay to catch up with the inflation spawned by the easy money of “Abenomics�� in the coming fiscal year, economists say.But import costs have risen on the back of a softer currency and many importers as well as smaller firms will be offering much smaller raises or not lifting pay at all, a Reuters Corporate Survey showed.“A weak yen does more harm than good to small firms and those based in areas outside of Tokyo,�� said Hisashi Yamada, chief economist at Japan Research Institute. “And last year’s sales tax hike is still weighing on private consumption, forcing small firms to cut their selling prices.”About 70 percent of Japanese workers are employed by small and medium-sized firms.Bellwether Toyota said it plans to raise base salary by 4,000 yen ($33) a month, up from last year’s increase of 2,700 yen and the biggest hike in over a decade, although it fell short of union demands for 6,000 yen.Early union data from 25 companies showed an average hike of 3,013 yen in base salaries per month, roughly 75 percent bigger than last year’s increase.Last year, major firms raised wages an average 2.19 percent, a 15-year high, including seniority gains. Economists expect the increase to accelerate to around 2.5 percent this year.That would translate into a rise of about 1 percent in wage-earners�� total cash earnings across all firms and including part-time workers, economists reckon. Cash earnings rose 0.8 percent last year.But even two years of pay raises are not expected offset a climb in living costs that came with a sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent last April, the Reuters Corporate Survey showed.Due to the sales tax hike, inflation-adjusted wages fell 2.5 percent in 2014. Economists, however, expect real wages to turn positive in the fiscal year starting next month, partly as tumbling crude oil prices push consumer inflation to a halt.Wage hikes are also likely to be much rarer for the growing ranks of contract and other “non-regular�� workers, underscoring the challenge to spreading the trickle-down benefits of Abenomics.""Toyota is offering 4,000 yen, and that world is so foreign to me,"" said Souichi Namiki, whose pay dropped by a quarter last year when he was working as a contract teacher at cram school operator Ichishin 4645.T. ""We are having to lower our living standards even more."""	-1.177898344
(Repeats to add additional reporting credit, no change to text)BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. is still dogged by a sales crisis Japanese carmakers are suffering in China as a result of a territorial row between the two countries but December sales proved “surprisingly resilient��, a senior Toyota executive said.The executive said customer traffic in Toyota’s showrooms was recovering to levels seen before the crisis over the disputed islands in the East China Sea broke out last September.Toyota sold “almost�� 90,000 vehicles in China in December, compared with 108,000 cars the company and its two Chinese partners sold in December 2011.Toyota is expected to announce its China sales data for December on Monday, according to a Beijing-based company spokesman. He did not respond to calls seeking comment on November sales.The pace of last month’s decline -- roughly 17 percent from a year earlier -- eased from the previous three months.“Sales rebounded faster than we had expected,�� said the Toyota executive, who declined to be identified because the sales information has not been made public yet.He attributed the recovery in part to discounts and other sales incentives the Japanese company provided during the month.Toyota’s December sales fall followed a decline of 22 percent in November, 44 percent in October, and almost 50 percent in September.Signs in the marketplace across China -- including a recovery in customer traffic in dealer showrooms -- were “encouraging��, the Toyota executive said.Sales patterns showed consumers were no longer as spooked as they were before a surge of anti-Japan sentiment that affected sales at auto stores and other Japanese-branded companies such as electronics firms.Violent anti-Japan protests swept China from mid-September after Japan bought two East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese, from their private owner. China claims the islands as its own territory.Demand slumped in September and October, reducing the market share of Japanese firms in China’s passenger car market to about 17 percent from 19 percent at the end of August, according to the China Association of Automotive Manufacturers.Some Chinese consumers have since avoided Japanese cars. In a widely reported incident during the height of the anti-Japanese sentiment, a Chinese man was attacked by angry protesters for driving a Toyota Corolla.December sales showed Chinese consumers were “not as fearful of buying and driving Japanese cars as before��, the Toyota executive said.

* Slow sales, high incentives cloud mid-term share, profitability goals* Apr-Dec operating profit margin 4.1 percent, narrower than Toyota, Honda* Oct-Dec net profit rises 56.8 percent to 84.3 bln yen, beats estimates* Keeps FY forecast at 355 bln yen vs 364.2 bln yen analyst view (Recasts with executive comments)By Yoko Kubota and Maki ShirakiYOKOHAMA, Japan, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co could sacrifice its global market share goal to reach its mid-term profitability target after slower-than-expected sales in its biggest markets left its profit margin the tightest among Japanese car makers.Nissan’s six-year plan ending 2017, in which it aims to boost its market share to 8 percent from 6 percent, has been shaken by a Sino-Japanese diplomatic dispute knocking sales in China, and manufacturing difficulties hitting U.S. product launches.Japan’s second-largest carmaker by global sales volume after Toyota Motor Corp also aims for operating profit equivalent to 8 percent of revenue by March 2017 through scaling back buying incentives in the United States and cutting costs with alliance partner Renault SA.Nissan, on reporting an 18.4 percent rise in April-December net profit on Monday, said its nine-month operating margin was 4.1 percent, down from 4.5 percent a year earlier. That compared with 6.6 percent at Honda Motor Co and 9.7 percent at Toyota.“If we can meet our 8 percent profitability target, then it is fine if the share is a little lower and the company is moving to emphasise profitability,�� Corporate Vice President Joji Tagawa told reporters after Nissan released earnings.Nissan reported nine-month net profit of 274.1 billion yen ($2.68 billion). For October-December, profit rose 56.8 percent to 84.3 billion yen compared with a 57.1 billion yen mean estimate of seven analysts in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll.The quarterly net profit growth was the steepest in almost two years as a weaker yen allowed Nissan to convert money made overseas at a more favourable exchange rate, and as sales improved in China where some consumers boycotted Japanese goods following a territorial row in September 2012.Shares of Nissan ended Monday 0.1 percent higher before the earnings release compared with a 1.8 percent rise in the benchmark index.The maker of Infiniti and Datsun brands left its profit outlook for the full year ending March at 355 billion yen, or 4.1 percent more than the year prior, compared with analysts�� 364.2 billion yen estimate.Nissan cut the outlook three months ago by nearly 20 percent, citing heavy investment in new plants and product recall-related costs.“We expect to see a significant improvement in our financial performance in the last three months of our fiscal year,�� Tagawa said, adding that he expects steady sales in Japan, China and the United States.Nissan offers more incentives to buy its cars in the United States than its Japanese and South Korean rivals, squeezing profit margins.In October-December, Nissan’s incentives knocked an average $2,562 from each vehicle’s retail price compared with $1,952 for Toyota, $1,799 for Honda and $1,759 for Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp, according to industry researcher Autodata.In January, Nissan’s U.S. sales rose 12 percent on year to 90,470 vehicles, helped by strong sales of the redesigned Rogue crossover sport utility vehicle.Based on accounting standards in place when setting mid-term targets, Nissan on Monday said April-December operating profit margin would have been 4.7 percent, and that it would assess the targets on the basis of the previous standards.	-6.530404546

(Adds GM share price, background on air taxis and other automakers)DETROIT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is exploring options in the aerial taxi market, including whether to build the vehicles known colloquially as “flying cars,�� as part of a push by the U.S. automaker to look for growth in related transportation markets, two people familiar with the matter said.Chief Executive Mary Barra on Monday briefly made her first reference ever to Detroit-based GM’s interest in the air taxi market, saying that it fit with development of electric vehicles (EVs) and its Ultium advanced electric battery.“We believe strongly in our EV future and not just for vehicles,�� she said at an RBC conference. “The strength and flexibility of our Ultium battery system opens doors�� for many uses, she added, “including aerial mobility.”Air taxis are vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that use electric motors instead of jet engines. Designed to avoid the need for long runways, they have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they could add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.GM spokesman Stuart Fowle declined to elaborate. “It’s an area we’re really excited about and looking at.”GM shares were up almost 2% in midday trading.Corporate and private investors have poured at least $2.3 billion into more than 100 aerial vehicle startups, including drones and electric air taxis, but the technology still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to investor website PitchBook.GM is weighing all options - whether to build, supply or partner - as it decides whether to join such automakers as Hyundai Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG and Geely Automobile in the still-developing market, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. GM could make an announcement early next year.GM’s study of the aerial mobility market is part of the push by GM’s innovation group to explore other transportation markets for growth, one of the sources said. The group is headed by Alan Wexler, who reports to Barra and was hired in July in the newly created position of senior vice president of innovation and growth.Other efforts that originated in the innovation group include formation of a defense business unit and a $214 million contract to build troop carriers for the U.S. Army based on the Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as a new mobile app for OnStar members.Hyundai teamed up with Uber Technologies Inc in January to develop electric air taxis and has pledged to invest $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025.Toyota led a $590 million investment round in air taxi startup Joby in January, while Daimler and Geely have invested in Stuttgart-based Volocopter. Volkswagen’s Porsche brand is working with Boeing to develop a concept electric flying vehicle.Last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called electric supersonic VTOL a “hard problem,�� and last month said a more powerful battery that could enable electric airplanes was three to four years away. Musk has said “many exciting things�� will be unveiled during Tesla’s Battery Day on Sept. 22. (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio)	-2.529284489

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group representing major automakers will tell the U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday that imposing tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts would raise the price of U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors Co GM.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, said it plans to issue the warning at a public hearing on Thursday.“Higher auto tariffs will harm American families and workers, along with the economy�� and “would raise the price of an imported car nearly $6,000 and the price of a U.S.-built car $2,000,�� the group said in its testimony released on Wednesday.The European Union, Japan, Canada, Mexico, along with many automotive trade groups, Volkswagen, and the United Auto Workers union are among those scheduled to testify at the hearing.The Trump administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles and parts pose a national security threat and U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he would quickly impose tariffs of 20 or 25 percent. The Commerce Department said Wednesday it had made no decisions and aims to complete the investigation “within a couple months.”The auto industry has banded together in a full-scale campaign to oppose the tariffs, with companies warning of slower auto sales due to higher prices, lost jobs as well as reduced spending on self-driving cars.Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told company dealers in an email seen by Reuters that “Toyota and the entire auto industry is facing a very dangerous public policy threat �� a potential 25% tariff on all imported autos and auto parts �� and we need YOU to help us win this battle!”GM warned last month that higher tariffs could cost jobs and lead to a “a smaller GM�� while isolating U.S. businesses from the global market.John Bozzella, who heads the Association of Global Automakers, which represents Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Hyundai Motor Corp 005380.KS and other foreign automakers, said in his testimony prepared for Thursday that Commerce ""so far has been unable to outline any theory explaining how the commercial production of cars and trucks is connected to U.S. national security.""Many automakers opted not to testify at the hearing because they believe Trump cannot be swayed from his decision to impose the tariffs. Some administration officials have suggested that his threats are a tactic to win concessions in trade talks, including North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiations.A coalition of seven major auto trade groups representing automakers, dealers, parts companies and retailers issued a joint statement urging the administration to reverse course.On Thursday ahead of the hearing, auto workers from around the country will drive to Capitol Hill to show how tariffs could impact the industry, holding an event with members of Congress."	-6.45063368
TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd's 7201.T management has become convinced the struggling automaker needs to be much smaller and a restructuring plan due out next month would likely assume a cut of 1 million cars to its annual sales target, senior company sources said.Even before the spread of the coronavirus, Nissan’s sales and profits had been slumping and it was burning through cash, forcing it to row back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. The pandemic has only piled on urgency and pressure to renewed efforts to downsize.No new sales target has been finalised and it remains unclear whether one will be formally disclosed.But Nissan’s plans for restructuring through to March 2023 should be based on the assumption that it would only be able to return to annual sales of 5 million cars by then, two sources said, adding this would entail a large reduction to manufacturing capacity.That compares with a goal of 6 million cars for the same period outlined in July by then-CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who had already stepped back from around 8 million targeted under Ghosn. Nissan likely sold about 5 million cars in the past financial year but this year’s outlook is bleaker due to the pandemic.“For years, Nissan was looking for annual sales volumes around 7-8 million vehicles. The company has never managed to sell much more than 5 million or so,�� one of the sources told Reuters. “The company can no longer consider this sort of wishful thinking. The resizing issue is really being taken into account, it has a lot of consequences on operations for 2020-2022.�� A third senior company source said the figure could be even lower than 5 million given the impact of the virus, which has hammered car demand around the world.The sources declined to be identified as details of the turnaround plan have yet to finalised.In July, Nissan said it was aiming to cut annual global production capacity to around 6.5 million vehicles. Shrinking its sales target by 1 million vehicles would equate to closing three to four more assembly plants and shedding thousands more jobs on top of already announced plans to cut its workforce by 10%. The cutbacks would also ripple through to its suppliers and dealers.Nissan declined to comment on its progress in devising a new mid-term plan. “The details will be shared in May,�� a spokeswoman said.For interactive charts on Nissan's global vehicle sales and operating margins, click on reut.rs/2USzcFyThe people said that a key metric of the recovery plan will be its operating profit margin and new CEO Makoto Uchida is likely to keep Saikawa’s target for a margin of about 6%, one of the people said. In the third quarter, the margin was just 0.9%.“At the very least, a downsizing is a given,�� the person said.By comparison, operating margins at top-selling automakers Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE before the coronavirus pandemic hovered around 8%. Another top priority will be the preservation of cash.As of December, Nissan’s automotive operations had negative free cash flow of 670.9 billion yen, a more than 6-fold increase from a year ago. “That’s no longer at an acceptable level,�� said one of the people.For an interactive chart on Nissan's overall cashflow and net cash levels, click on reut.rs/2VgkJSNNissan has requested a $4.6 billion commitment line from major lenders to cushion the impact of the pandemic while it seeks to engineer the desperately needed turnaround, people with knowledge of the matter have said.	1.946231239
* Production of auto parts makers down by 30-35 pct* More than 30,000 subcontracted workers laid off this year* Industry looks to July polls for fresh startBANGKOK, May 9 (Reuters) - Thailand’s auto sector, Southeast Asia’s biggest, has fired more than 30,000 subcontracted workers this year and slashed production, as sales plunge after months of political unrest that threatens to drive some manufacturers offshore.The lay-offs are the latest sign that the auto industry, accounting for about 11 percent of Thai economic output, is being hit hard by the prolonged power-struggle between the Bangkok-based royalist establishment and the mainly rural supporters of ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.The crisis deepened on Wednesday, when a court ordered Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin’s sister, to step down after finding her guilty of abuse of power, leaving a caretaker government to press ahead with plans for a July election.As a regional production and export base, Thailand’s troubles have major implications for top manufacturers such as Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Ford Motor Co, which may be forced to shift some production to cheaper bases such as Indonesia, the region’s second-biggest auto market.“As political instability continues, we are concerned that automakers may reduce their exposure to Thailand to diversify their risk,�� said Kovit Wongkolkitsilp, chairman of the auto parts group of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).Honda Motor Co said it was considering delaying the start-up of a new $530 million manufacturing plant in Thailand by six months to a year, as the economy teeters on the brink of recession and political turmoil prompts automakers to rethink their investments.“It’s critical especially in the auto sector. We have seen a big lot of layoffs, about 500 to 700 staff, several times in recent months,�� National Congress of Thai Labour President Panus Thailuan said.Toru Hasegawa, Nissan’s Indonesia chief, said that “because of the political uncertainty, total industry volume is a bit affected��, but he added that Thailand remained a key market for the company.“They are also a big market and still growing. For Nissan, Southeast Asia is very much important,�� Hasegawa said.Rival Toyota said at the start of the year it planned to sell 400,000 vehicles in Thailand this year, but in the three months to March saw sales there drop 33 percent to 84,000.Toyota Executive Vice President Nobuyori Kodaira told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday that the car maker might have to consider cutting its sales outlook for Thailand as a result.“Thailand is one of our very important strongholds globally and we have no change in our stance to make vehicles and conduct business there,�� he said.The roughly 30,000 mostly low-skilled sub-contractors who Panus said had been laid off this year represent about 3 percent of the auto sector’s workforce.The layoffs reflect a year of sliding domestic sales that has sucked the life out of an auto industry that relies on local buyers to consume about half of its output.The expiry last year of a first-car subsidy scheme, which had sparked a surge in demand in 2012, has exacerbated the downturn in the domestic market, analysts said.“Auto part makers�� production has dropped by 30 to 35 percent so far this year. They are suffering from the impact of poor domestic demand and fierce competition from rivals in the export market,�� the FTI’s Kovit said.Domestic auto sales in March this year plummeted 46.7 percent compared with a year earlier, according to the FTI. March output slumped 29 percent on year, while car makers focused more on export markets. Auto exports rose 9 percent on year to the highest in six months.“Right now, consumers are not confident to spend and farmers have less money to afford new cars, and that’s why demand has dropped sharply,�� said Sompong Phaoenchoke, managing director at auto assembler Thai Rung Union Car Pcl.Companies that depend on domestic sales rather than exports say the industry should bottom out in the first half, amid signs that output and sales turned a corner in March compared with the previous month.Automakers are planning to launch new models to stoke demand in the second half, hoping the election will go ahead in July and the formation of a new government will resolve the political deadlock.“We may see the light at the end of the tunnel. If the new election is held in July, we should have a new government in the third quarter. The sooner the better so we can recover,�� Kovit said.

March 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp named an engineer to head its North American operations and promoted Jim Lentz, who helped orchestrate the Japanese automaker’s response to a string of safety recalls that began in late 2009.The company said on Wednesday that it had appointed Shigeki Terashi, 57, currently head of its U.S. engineering and manufacturing operations, as president and chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America Inc.Terashi replaces Yoshi Inaba, 66, who will remain on the executive committee and retain his position as chairman of the subsidiary Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc.Lentz, 56, will be president and chief executive officer of the U.S. sales unit, making him one of the highest-ranking American executives at the company.The moves will take effect April 1, Toyota said in a statement.From 2009 to 2011, Toyota recalled 11.5 million vehicles worldwide due to complaints of unintended acceleration linked to defective floor mats, gas pedals and related problems.Lentz and Inaba both played key roles in handling Toyota’s response to its safety crisis, which undermined sales and hurt its brand. Both testified in front of U.S. lawmakers and apologized for Toyota’s errors during a decade of rapid global growth.In a particularly damaging 2009 memo to Inaba, Toyota’s Washington staff lauded the company’s ability to limit a 2007 recall of floor mats. This saved Toyota $100 million, said the memo, which surfaced during the hearings.Inaba said he did not remember the memo and that it did not represent the automaker’s guiding principles and beliefs. Both he and Toyota President Akio Toyoda said they were unaware of key pieces of information that might have helped the company respond faster to safety concerns.Since then, Toyota has changed its approach to safety by slowing vehicle development and giving more power to regional units so they can handle customer complaints quickly.Lentz’s appointment is in keeping with Toyota’s efforts to develop and promote local talent and “shows confidence in U.S. operations,�� said company spokesman Steve Curtis.Terashi, who will retain his current position as president of Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing in North America, joined the company in 1980 in the body engineering design division and began by working on the Camry mid-sized car.Before assuming his current position, Terashi led the Toyota Technical Center and oversaw the development and launch of the Venza crossover vehicle, Sienna minivan and other products in North America.	-0.9936984973
NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India’s auto sales volume will not return to the peak levels seen in 2018 for another three-to-four years, an industry body executive said on Tuesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated disruption in a sector already hit by weak demand.In the fiscal year that began on April 1, sales of cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), motorbikes and trucks have already fallen 75% from a year ago to about 1.5 million vehicles, data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) showed.That compares with a peak of more than 26 million units in the fiscal year 2018-19 before a slowdown in consumer demand last year pushed auto sales 18% lower to 21.5 million.“The impact of COVID-19 is going to be very harsh on the auto industry. As of now, we are staring into a very deep slowdown,�� Rajan Wadhera, president of SIAM, told reporters.“We don’t see the situation becoming normal - reaching 2018 volumes - for another 3-4 years,�� he said.India went into lockdown in late March to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, forcing automakers to suspend manufacturing. While production has resumed, with restrictions, plant utilisation levels are low at 20%-30%.They are expected to rise to 40% this month, Wadhera said, but supply chains are still disrupted and some cities are facing fresh lockdown restrictions as cases of the novel coronavirus continue to rise.The southern state of Karnataka, home to Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T car plant, went into a week-long lockdown starting Tuesday, forcing the Japanese automaker to temporarily halt production. Wadhera said there was some pent up demand for cars, but momentum could be lost unless the government acts to boost demand. SIAM is lobbying for a tax cut on auto sales and a scheme to incentivise the scrapping of old vehicles, he said.	5.411136417
TOKYO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday said it was recalling a total of 2.43 million gasoline hybrid vehicles at home and abroad over a hybrid system issue which can lead to stalling.The recall, which includes Prius and Auris models, covers vehicles produced between October 2008 and November 2014.It affects about 1.25 million vehicles sold in Japan, 830,000 vehicles in North America, and 290,000 vehicles sold in Europe. Vehicles sold in China, Africa, Oceania and other regions are also affected.In a statement, Toyota said that in “rare situations��, some vehicles could fail to switch to a “failsafe�� driving mode in the event of a fault with the hybrid system, which can lead to a loss of power and result in stalling.The automaker said that it was not aware of any crashes due to the issue in Japan.

(Repeats story first published late on Tuesday with no changes to text)TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s warning it could rethink further investment plans in Thailand looks aimed at signalling its deep frustration over a drawn-out political crisis, but Japanese car makers are unlikely to scale back Thai operations any time soon.Until recently the likes of Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co have said mostly that anti-government protests in Bangkok, now in their third month, were having little impact on their local bases.But Toyota has broken ranks, with the head of the company’s Thai subsidiary saying on Monday it may reconsider a planned investment of up to $609 million, and could even cut production, if the unrest drags on.“Japanese companies have continued to invest in Thailand even in the face of big floods and past political turmoil,�� a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.“Regardless of what might happen with investments there, the message was an alarm bell.”The Thai government said on Tuesday it would impose a 60-day state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding provinces as it attempts to contain a protest movement that has blockaded parts of the capital and is seeking the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.Auto manufacturing is Thailand’s third-largest industry, accounting for more than 10 percent of gross domestic product, with an annual output of around 2.5 million vehicles that has seen it dubbed the “Detroit of the East��.Japanese car makers have been investing in Thailand for decades and have come to rely on the country as an export hub. They also control around 80 percent of the Thai car market, the biggest in Southeast Asia.In the short-term Japanese car makers are unlikely to shift production elsewhere given the country’s crucial position in their global manufacturing strategy.Toyota makes about one-in-10 of its cars in Thailand and plans to invest around 20 billion baht ($609 million) to boost annual capacity by 200,000 vehicles over the next three or four years, to 1 million vehicles.Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp have each positioned Thailand as a hub to manufacture small cars, exporting them not only to neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia but also to Japan.But the current political woes could spur car makers to diversify their manufacturing base over the longer term, said Shingo Ikeda, a principal at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, Southeast Asia.Indonesia, with roughly four times the population, is expected to surpass Thailand as the region’s biggest auto market in the next few years, and would be the most likely alternative, since Japanese automakers already make cars there and labour costs are relatively low.“Unlike in the past when it was single-handedly dependent on Thailand, Toyota has more leeway to shift to Indonesia the production capacity that it plans to add to Thailand,�� said Ryuichiro Inoue, a professor at Tokyo City University and an auto industry expert.For example, Toyota theoretically could shift production of its multi-purpose vehicle series called IMV, developed as global models with similar structure and parts, from Thailand to Indonesia relatively easily.But any such shift would not happen quickly. Given the hefty investments that car makers have made into Thailand, the country will remain a dominant manufacturing site for the time being, helped by a strong supplier network and highly trained workers.For now, Japanese car makers other than Toyota say they will be sticking with their investment plans in Thailand.“There is no change in our stance of continuing to position Thailand as one of our key overseas manufacturing sites,�� Mazda spokeswoman Misato Kobayashi said.Nissan is investing 11 billion Thai baht ($335 million) in its second Thai plant, which will start operating by end-March. Honda is also building a second car plant there with an investment of 17.2 billion baht and a start-up target of 2015. Mazda is building a $250 million transmission plant.

(Reuters) - Major automakers have announced a slew of investments in the United States since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017 and exerted pressure on the industry to create more U.S. jobs.China is also attracting much investment, with companies keen to increase their share of the world’s largest car market and keep up with the country’s push toward electric vehicles.Following are summaries of investments and restructuring efforts made by major automakers in the United States and China since 2017. Some did not respond to requests for information or only provided details for one country.Toyota Motor Corp has pledged to invest almost $13 billion in the United States between 2017 and 2021 to boost manufacturing capacity and jobs. This includes $1.6 billion for a vehicle assembly plant in Alabama jointly run with Mazda Motor Corp and $238 million in manufacturing capacity in Kentucky to assemble 112,000 gasoline-electric hybrid models a year. Toyota’s Kentucky plant has also gained $1.3 billion in investment to boost its competitiveness.FCA in January 2017 said it would invest $1 billion in truck and SUV manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Ohio, creating 2,000 U.S. jobs. It described the plan as a move to solidify the United States as its global manufacturing hub for Jeep products. In February this year, it announced additional investment of $4.5 billion in production facilities in Michigan, to produce more SUVs and trucks and create nearly 6,500 jobs.General Motors Co in November 2018 announced a sweeping restructuring program that aims to cut production of slow-selling models and slash its North American workforce so resources can be shifted to electric and autonomous vehicles. GM put four U.S. factories and one Canadian plant on notice for potential closure. It noted in late April that it has invested $4.3 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations since 2017.Ford Motor Co in 2017 said it would invest $2.95 billion in manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and Michigan. Those plans included $900 million for its Kentucky truck plant to secure 1,000 hourly jobs and produce the redesigned Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. This year, Ford said it will invest an additional $1.2 billion in manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Illinois to expand production capacity and add new jobs.In 2017, Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and parts suppliers, said it planned to lift U.S. investment by 50% over five years to $3.1 billion. An executive said at that time the group was considering a new U.S. factory to build high-margin, high-demand models such as a U.S.-specific sport utility vehicle and a Genesis premium vehicle.In January this year, Volkswagen AG said it planned to invest $800 million to build what it called a new generation of electric vehicles at its Chattanooga plant in Tennessee. The first electric car from the plant is slated to roll off the production line in 2022.Honda Motor Co said in 2017 it would invest a combined $352 million in manufacturing facilities located in Alabama and Ohio that would support production of the redesigned Accord car and create jobs. It also said it would spend $124 million on an advanced wind tunnel facility in Ohio.Although not formally announced, the Japanese automaker has confirmed information from sources that is investing in capacity in Tianjin and Guangzhou to produce 240,000 more vehicles annually. The size of the investment is not known.The company’s China unit did not respond to a Reuters request for information.No major additional investment in China manufacturing capacity since the Detroit automaker announced it had earmarked $12 billion to expand production between 2014 and 2017.Ford said in 2017 it would invest in its joint-venture manufacturing facilities in China to support production of five vehicles, including a Lincoln premium SUV and the company’s first global all-electric small SUV. The investment amount was not disclosed.In 2018, Ford said it would invest in joint-venture manufacturing facilities in Chongqing to produce vehicles including the redesigned Escort and Focus models. It also said it would be investing to assemble the redesigned Explorer SUV but did not disclose where it will be made.This year the U.S. automaker announced plans to produce three Lincoln models in China by 2021, instead of bringing in those models from North America.Hit by a downturn in sales, Hyundai said in April it was suspending production at one of its five plants in China. Kia is also looking at suspending production at a China plant, a source familiar with the matter has said.Volkswagen Group in 2018 opened three factories �� in Qingdao, Foshan and Tianjin �� to produce more SUVs and electric cars as well as other vehicles. The German group, which produces and sells vehicles in China through its Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda brands, also broke ground for its electric-car factory in Shanghai, which will start e-car production in 2020.Through 2022, Volkswagen Group and its joint-venture partners will invest around 15 billion euros in e-mobility, autonomous driving and other areas. This includes R&amp;D spending on new technologies. In June 2017, it announced a 50-50 joint venture with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co, its third partnership with a Chinese automaker, to design, produce and market electric cars.Honda’s joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group in December 2016 announced it would build a 3 billion yuan ($435 million) assembly plant in Wuhan capable of producing 120,000 vehicles a year. The plant opened in April this year.($1 = 6.9063 Chinese yuan)	6.384778013
LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - British car production rose to its highest level since 2007 last year, up 1.2 percent to 1.528 million cars, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Friday.The growth was driven by strong domestic demand, as exports fell slightly, something SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes blamed on a weaker than expected recovery in the euro zone and elsewhere.“More than 7 billion pounds ($10.5 billion) of investment into UK production facilities has been announced in the past two years, and we are now seeing the effects as new models begin production -- with more expected in 2015,�� Hawes said.Britain is a major centre for manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover, BMW, Nissan, Honda , Toyota and General Motors.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp , the world’s fifth-largest chipmaker, posted a smaller-than-expected operating loss of 5.7 billion yen ($71.6 million) for the July-September quarter on Monday, down 44 percent from the same period last year.The result beat a forecast by four analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S for a 9.4 billion yen ($118.2 million) operating loss.It is the seventh consecutive quarterly operating loss for Renesas, which sources say is in talks on a 200 billion yen bailout by the taxpayer-funded Innovation Network Corp and a consortium of the chipmaker’s major clients including Toyota Motor Corp.Renesas stuck to its forecast for an operating profit of 21 billion yen for the full year to next March 31.On a net basis, Renesas forecast a loss of 150 billion yen for the year to March, unchanged from its July outlook.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T plan to slash production in China by roughly half, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday, as a territorial row between Asia's two largest economies cuts sales of Japanese cars in the world's biggest auto market.Sales have plunged at Japanese car makers since violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September over the Japanese government’s purchase of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea from their private owner.Nissan will suspend the night shift at its passenger car factories in China and operate only during the day, the business daily said. Nissan has two passenger car factories in China, in Huadu and Zhengzhou, with two lines each. A Nissan spokesman declined to confirm the report.Toyota and Honda plan to cut China production to about half normal levels by shortening working hours and slowing down the speed of production lines, the Nikkei said without citing a source.A Honda spokeswoman said she was checking the report.A Toyota spokesman could not confirm the details of the report, saying that plants in China were operating again as planned after the country’s national holiday period last week and that production was taking placed based on market demand.Toyota’s China sales fell about 40 percent in September from a year before to about 50,000 cars, a senior company executive told Reuters last week. [ID:nL3E8L46W3] The firm is set to officially release its September China sales figures on Tuesday.The Nikkei report did not say how long the output cuts would last.A spokeswoman for Mazda 7261.T, which halted production for two extra days in late September before it shutdown factories during the holiday season, said plants in China were operating again but declined to comment on details.A spokesman for Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T, which in late September had stopped one of two shifts that it normally runs in China ahead of the holiday season, said production was now back to what it was prior to the holiday.Anti-Japan sentiment across China escalated last month amid a row over a group of uninhabited islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China, whose nearby waters are thought to hold potentially rich natural gas reserves. They have been under Japan’s control since 1895.Demonstrators vandalized properties of Japanese companies, including a Toyota outlet in the eastern city of Qingdao that was torched, in the latest flare-up in tensions that have smoldered since the end of World War Two.The latest production adjustments come on top of general cutbacks the Japanese automakers had been making before the protests, as the Chinese economy grew at its slowest pace in more than three years in the second quarter.But the dramatic drop in demand for cars made by Japanese brands, which had a combined share of roughly a fifth of China’s passenger car market in August before the protests, has been an unexpected boon for foreign rivals.South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co's 005380.KS China sales climbed 15 percent to 84,188 vehicles last month, while Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Audi boosted sales by 20 percent, BMW BMWG.DE by 55 percent and Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz by 10 percent.	3.025601241
EditorsNote: Added details on Westbrook’s shooting in 4th graf; Noted visiting team in ledeJames Harden poured in a game-high 47 points and served as the closer down the stretch of the Houston Rockets�� 102-93 win over the visiting Los Angeles Clippers Wednesday at Toyota Center.After Kawhi Leonard provided the Clippers an 86-85 lead with a fading jumper in the paint, Harden converted a driving layup and then drilled a 3-pointer as Houston reclaimed a 90-86 advantage. With just over 90 seconds to play, Harden nailed a dagger 3 for a 95-88 lead.Clippers coach Doc Rivers was ejected immediately thereafter. Houston extended its winning streak to five games. Harden shot 7 of 13 on 3s, grabbed six boards and had seven assists.Russell Westbrook added 17 points, despite 6-for-20 shooting, for the Rockets while center Clint Capela posted his third consecutive 20-rebound game, pairing 12 points with 20 boards before departing after a collision with Clippers forward JaMychal Green late in the fourth quarter.Leonard, who gave the Clippers their first lead at 84-80 with a four-point play at the 6:52 mark of the fourth, paced the Clippers with 26 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. Lou Williams chipped in 20 points off the bench and Green delivered a double-double (14 points, 14 boards).The Rockets�� fast start, bolstered by 14 paint points in their 31-point first period, fizzled quickly in the second. With Westbrook benched after accumulating four fouls in the first quarter, the Clippers focused their defense exclusively on Harden. That meant Leonard had the assignment.Houston extended to a 36-19 lead on a Tucker 3 early in the second period, added a Capela alley-oop roughly two minutes later and then went five minutes without a point. Leonard and Williams pulled the Clippers to within 38-33 before the Rockets found some juice, with Tucker and Harden burying three 3s before Harden added a floater with 16 seconds remaining.The Rockets led 49-37 at the intermission, their points surrendered the fewest in any half this season. But when the Clippers started running their offense through center Ivica Zubac to start the second half, the Rockets again hit a slump and opened the door for the Clippers to rally.--Field Level Media	-0.9313963995

* Auto market continues slowdown that began in spring* Economic clouds temper July sales -analysts, executives* GM U.S. July sales drop 6 pct, Ford sales down 4 pct* Chrysler sales up 13 pct, Toyota up 26 pct* Autodata sees July sales up 9 pct; annual sales pace at 14.1 mlnBy Deepa Seetharaman and Bernie WoodallDETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales rose a lower-than-expected 9 percent in July as high U.S. unemployment and weak consumer confidence kept would-be buyers on the sidelines.Wednesday’s figures showed a continuation of the slowdown in sales growth that began in late spring. After a strong start in the first quarter, sales growth has been softer in recent months.Overall industry sales rose to nearly 1.2 million vehicles in July, according to research firm Autodata Corp. This fell slightly short of Edmunds.com’s estimate of a 10.2 percent jump.July sales reported by major automakers General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp also fell short of several analyst forecasts.“Perhaps there was an overestimation of consumers�� willingness to spend money,�� said TrueCar.com analyst Jesse Toprak.“It’s the economy. There is no way around it,�� said George Magliano, senior economist with IHS Automotive. “In this kind of environment, it’s very difficult for light vehicle sales to get any traction.”Lack of significant job growth and confusion about government policy on tax cuts and spending tempered sales in July, Magliano said. In conference calls on Wednesday, executives at GM and Ford said the U.S. job market and consumer confidence remain weak.The annual U.S. auto sales pace for July came in at 14.1 million vehicles, according to Autodata. But the figure was inflated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis�� move Wednesday to revise seasonal factors used to calculate the July annual sales rate.The BEA revision added about 200,000 vehicle sales to the annual rate for July, KBB economist Alec Gutierrez wrote in a note. When stripping out those additional vehicles, the sales rate slightly missed KBB’s estimate. On average, analysts had expected the July rate to be 14 million.Auto sales have been one of the bright spots in the U.S. economy and car companies are anticipating a second-half sales increase spurred partly by the introduction of a slate of new models.Since 1976, annual new vehicle sales have hovered around 12 million when the U.S. unemployment rate averaged 8 percent or higher, according to Kelley Blue Book. The jobless rate is now 8.2 percent, suggesting that Americans�� growing need to replace their aging models is driving sales to about 14 million.Still, this demand “cannot carry industry growth indefinitely,�� Gutierrez wrote.GM and Ford executives pointed to recent encouraging signs in the housing sector, which could spur sales of pickup trucks. Meanwhile Toyota and others said attractive financing for consumers would spur sales as well.“We think some truck buyers have been reacting to the mixed economic signals of the last few months,�� said Kurt McNeil, head of GM’s U.S. sales operations. “But recent reports of consumer confidence, home prices, and personal income were better than expected.”In July, dealers were able to offer better financing packages and other promotions to shoppers. In August, Toyota will offer zero percent financing on seven of its models. GM will continue two programs started in mid-July for its main Chevrolet brand, which accounts for more than 70 percent of GM’s U.S. sales. One allows owners to return new vehicles within 60 days of purchase, and another is a “no haggle�� pricing policy.Jessica Caldwell, analyst with Edmunds.com, said easier credit and low interest rates will help boost auto sales in August and in the coming months.Major automakers are increasingly counting on the U.S. auto market to offset weak sales in Europe. Last week, Ford reported a more than $1 billion loss in Europe due to the deepening economic crisis in the region.On Thursday, GM, the largest U.S. automaker, is expected to report second-quarter results. Its Opel brand in Europe is considered one of GM’s biggest risks.GM executives said they did not expect a change in marketing strategy after its top marketing executive, Joel Ewanick, was abruptly ousted earlier this week.GM reported on Wednesday a 6 percent drop in July U.S. sales, while Ford posted a 4 percent drop. The smallest U.S. automaker, Chrysler Group LLC, posted a 13 percent increase.GM sold 201,237 cars and trucks last month. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, sold 173,966 cars and trucks. Chrysler sold 126,089 cars and trucks.Toyota sales were up 26 percent to 164,898 in July. A year ago, Toyota was still grappling with major vehicle shortages stemming from the March earthquake in Japan.Edmunds had expected GM to report 214,315 vehicle sales and Ford at least 175,791. The firm expected Toyota sales to top 169,000. Chrysler beat Edmunds�� sales forecast but fell short of the Barclays Capital estimate of 129,453 vehicles and the RBC Capital Markets projection of 127,889.Ford shares ended 1.6 percent lower at $9.04, and GM shares dipped 0.3 percent to close at $19.66 on Wednesday.	2.206932364
EditorsNote: minor editsD.J. Augustin scored 24 points and was one of six players to reach double figures for the Orlando Magic, who dismantled the reeling Rockets 126-106 Sunday at Toyota Center in Houston.Despite playing without injured guard Evan Fournier, their second-leading scorer who sat with an elbow injury, the Magic ran roughshod over the defenseless Rockets, starting with a run midway through the opening quarter. Orlando turned its size advantage into a dominating display on the offensive glass, turning 13 first-half offensive rebounds into 22 second-chance points before the break.Nikola Vucevic (16 points, 16 rebounds) and Aaron Gordon (19 points, 10 rebounds) posted double-doubles to pace the effort on the interior for the Magic. Point guard Markelle Fultz posted 18 points despite battling cramps in his right calf. Michael Carter-Williams and Terrence Ross (16 points apiece) teamed with Augustin to give Orlando a 61-39 advantage in bench points.The Rockets have dropped four consecutive games and suffered a second successive blowout loss at home. After trailing by as many as 30 points in their 120-105 setback to the Los Angeles Clippers last Thursday, the Rockets trailed by as many as 32 points in the second half Sunday.Russell Westbrook and James Harden combined for 47 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists, but that duo also totaled 12 turnovers. Houston committed a dozen turnovers in the first half that Orlando parlayed into 20 points to fuel its attack. The Rockets have stumbled out of the gate in each of their past five games, even trailing the Boston Celtics by 17 before rallying to win last Sunday.Jeff Green added 18 points on 8-of-8 shooting off the bench for Houston, which missed 23-of-32 3-pointers. The Rockets played without guards Eric Gordon (knee) and Ben McLemore (illness).Harden scored five consecutive points to pull the Rockets even at 16-16 at the 5:14 mark of the first period, only for the Magic to respond with an 11-0 run that featured three successive treys. It was an uphill battle from there for Houston, one the Rockets appeared willing to fight with a spurt late in the second quarter that cut the deficit to 60-46 on a pair of Harden free throws.But Orlando closed the half with another 11-0 run that included a five-point possession. Gordon hit a 3 through a Green foul, with Green subsequently whistled for a technical foul. Robert Covington and Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni were also saddled with technicals with 3.9 seconds left in the half. When Vucevic made a hook shot with 10:56 left in the third, Orlando led 76-46.--Field Level Media	0.610798925
(Drops “Tokyo�� from paragraph 25)TOYOTA CITY, Japan/IRVINE, Calif., April 17 (Reuters) - In 1997, Toyota caught its competitors by surprise with the revolutionary Prius, the first commercially successful gasoline-electric hybrid car. Now, the Japanese firm is trying to do the same with a technology that seems straight out of science fiction.Toyota Motor Corp will next year launch a hydrogen-powered car in the United States, Japan and Europe. For now, people at Toyota are calling it the 2015 FC car, for fuel-cell.Fuel-cell cars use a “stack�� of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity that helps propel the car. Their only emission, bar heat, is water vapor, they can run five times longer than battery electric cars, and it takes just minutes to fill the tank with hydrogen - far quicker than even the most rapid charger can recharge a battery electric car.The 2015 launch culminates a 20-year zig-zag quest during which Toyota first struggled to get the technology to work and then strained to lower manufacturing costs enough to permit realistic pricing. It has also been playing catch-up to rival Honda Motor Co, which has set the early pace with its FCX Clarity, a sleek, purpose-built hydrogen car.The cost-cutting continues, though Toyota thinks it has cracked the code with incremental design improvements, such as using wider, flatter “fettuccine-style�� copper in coils that make the motor more powerful, and thus smaller and cheaper.“With the 2015 FC car we think we’ve achieved a degree of dominance over our rivals,�� Satoshi Ogiso, a Toyota managing director, said in a recent interview at the group’s global headquarters. “With the car, we make a first giant step�� toward making fuel-cell vehicles practical for everyday use.What’s more, executives and engineers say Toyota is willing to sell the car at a loss for a long while to popularize the new technology - just as it did with the Prius, which, with other hybrids, now accounts for 14 percent of Toyota’s annual sales, excluding group companies, of around 9 million vehicles.As a result, drivers in key “green�� markets such as California may be able to buy the car for a little more than $30,000-$40,000, after government subsidies - if management approves a pricing strategy put forward by a group of managers and engineers. General Motors Co’s Chevrolet Volt, a near-all-electric plug-in hybrid, for comparison, starts at around $35,000 in the United States.The stakes are high - for global automakers, oil producers, economies, and the environment.As with battery electric cars, a major challenge for fuel-cell automakers is a lack of infrastructure, with few hydrogen fuel stations in the world. Estimates vary, but it costs about $2 million to build a single hydrogen fuel station in the United States, according to Toyota executives.Safety is also a concern. Hydrogen is a highly flammable element when not handled properly.The Toyota launch pits fuel-cell technology against battery electric in a race to capture the hearts and wallets of drivers looking for engines that are easier on the environment. Automakers are under pressure to invest in so-called “zero-emission�� cars as tougher rules globally demand lower harmful emissions and better fuel economy.It’s a polarizing debate.Takeshi Uchiyamada, the 67-year-old “father of the Prius�� whose success catapulted him from mid-level engineer to Toyota board chairman, says technology inefficiencies will make the battery electric car little more than an “errands car�� - a small run-around for shopping, dropping the kids at school and other short-haul chores.Other global automakers in the fuel-cell camp include Daimler AG, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda, which plans to introduce an upgraded FCX Clarity next year with seating for five, a smaller fuel-cell stack, greater power and a longer driving range.Those betting on battery electric cars include Nissan Motor Co, Tesla Motors Inc, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, GM, Ford Motor Co and Chinese automakers backed by the country’s industrial policymakers. China offers generous purchase incentives for those buying battery electric cars and aims to have 5 million “new energy�� vehicles - mostly all-electric and near all-electric plug-in hybrids - on the road by 2020. Several of these will be exhibited at the Beijing auto show from April 20.Tesla chief Elon Musk has said hydrogen is an unsuitable fuel for cars. In a videotaped speech last year to employees and others at a new Tesla service center in Germany, Musk said: “Fuel-cell is so bullshit. Hydrogen is a quite dangerous gas. It’s suitable for the upper-stage rocket, but not for cars.”Even Toyota only expects tens of thousands of fuel-cell cars to be sold each year a decade from now as the new technology will need time to gain traction.It’s been a long road for Toyota to get this far.Ogiso, who was part of the team that came up with the Prius and now leads the development of hydrogen cars, likens the two-decade effort to “racing cars in dark tunnels.”�You don’t know whether you’re ahead or behind,�� said the 53-year-old engineer-turned executive.Just a decade ago, it cost more than $1 million to manufacture a fuel-cell vehicle propulsion system. Toyota has whittled down those costs and overcome technological hurdles, such as how to start the car in very cold weather.In October 2003, a materials researcher at Toyota’s tech center in Ann Arbor, Michigan gave a presentation in which he highlighted the difficulty his team faced in solving this issue. Shortly afterwards, rival Honda said it developed a fuel-cell car that could run in temperatures as low as minus 20 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). “It was embarrassing, and we were yelled at by the big bosses,�� recalled a person familiar with the incident.Five years later, there was more embarrassment at the hands of Honda - what Toyota fuel-cell engineers call the “Clarity shock�� - referring to Honda’s launch of the FCX Clarity. “Honda built every part of that from the ground up, and it had cool styling,�� said a Toyota engineer who has been on the fuel-cell team for more than a decade. “It sent shockwaves through our team.”On a single floor of Toyota’s research tower, across the street from the headquarters, some 200 material scientists, chemists, computer programmers and mechanical engineers worked to nail down the hydrogen electric fuel-cell technology they needed.A sizeable chunk of the cost savings has come from using less platinum as a catalyst in the electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in fuel economies. Toyota says its 2015 hydrogen car should drive 700 km (435 miles) on a single tank, more than many conventional gasoline-engine cars, and a strong selling point to those worried about driving range.Ogiso and his engineers are reluctant to talk specifically about how they made their breakthrough, but noted Toyota’s expertise in nanotechnology, allowing them to shrink platinum particles to better combine oxygen and hydrogen and generate more electricity. That allowed them to reduce the size of the cell stack and use less fuel to make the car go farther.Ogiso says Toyota has cut the platinum use per car by more than two-thirds through nanotechnology and stack-design improvements, and he expects to trim that further. Engineer Hitoshi Nomasa said a hydrogen-powered Toyota SUV now uses around 30 grams of platinum in the fuel-cell, down from 100 grams previously. Platinum currently costs $1,437 an ounce (28 grams) on world markets.Toyota has also borrowed spare parts from the Prius and other gasoline-electric hybrids it sells around the world. While the fuel-cell car uses hydrogen as fuel, it otherwise resembles the hybrid models as both use electricity to power their motors.“Very roughly ... under the hood of the 2015 FC car lie more or less the exact same components used for the Prius and other hybrids,�� said another Toyota fuel-cell engineer, referring to the electric motor, “transaxle�� gear and hybrid battery pack, among the parts lifted from the hybrid spares bin.Even the incremental advance with the “fettuccine coils�� - the wide, flat-shaped copper wire can bind the coil more tightly and needs less space - took the Toyota team a decade to hone.While costs have come down significantly, Toyota says a hydrogen car’s fuel-cell propulsion system alone still costs it close to $50,000 to produce. That’s partly why some Toyota money managers want a more conservative pricing strategy - of $50,000-$100,000 - said one individual on the 2015 FC car launch team.“It might be tough to price it below $50,000,�� Ogiso said. “But anything is possible at this point.�� (Editing by Ian Geoghegan)	-0.02761413844
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has issued civil subpoenas to four major automakers, demanding that they disclose details on a deal struck with California in July to follow strict vehicle emissions standards, a source briefed on the matter said on Thursday.The Justice Department is carrying out an antitrust investigation into the voluntary agreement. It comes against a growing number of fights between the Republican White House and California on a number of fronts, including numerous environmental issues.The Trump administration in September issued a determination that California cannot set its own vehicle emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates and is investigating if the companies engaged in anti-competitive conduct in striking the deal.The Justice Department has issued civil investigative demands to Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, the source said. The Wall Street Journal reported the subpoenas earlier.The subpoenas ask for details of how the agreements were reached and if the automakers engaged in improper conduct, the person said.The Justice Department declined to comment. The department has previously said that in August it sent the four automakers letters, without giving details.A BMW spokesman confirmed on Thursday it had received a subpoena.Ford and Volkswagen declined to comment, while Honda said it “will continue to work cooperatively with the Department of Justice with regard to the emissions framework reached between the State of California and various automotive manufacturers.”The subpoenas follow separate Justice Department meetings with the four automakers in October.In September, two Democratic lawmakers asked the White House to turn over documents that would show if President Donald Trump interfered or directed the antitrust probe, saying that it appeared to be “another example of the administration’s weaponization of the antitrust laws to target perceived political adversaries of the president.”Makan Delrahim, who heads the antitrust division, said in September he was not conducting the investigation for “political reasons.”Last month, other major automakers - including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - backed the Trump administration in its efforts to bar California from setting tailpipe emissions standards.Those automakers are backing Trump in two lawsuits brought by California and 22 other states and environmental groups, which seek to reverse the administration’s determination that California cannot set its own vehicle emissions rules. Those rules are followed by more than a dozen U.S. states.The automakers�� decision to side with Trump brought thanks from the president and prompted a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.In August 2018, the administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, which would result in an average fuel efficiency of 37 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 46.7 mpg under the Obama era rules.The Trump administration’s final requirements are expected to modestly boost fuel efficiency versus the initial proposal, with several automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, but are much less stringent than the Obama rules.	-1.731421844
LIMA (Reuters) - Qatar’s Nasser Al-Attiyah became a three times Dakar Rally winner on Thursday, taking no risks on the last stage to Lima and finishing with a 46-minute lead, while Australian Toby Price took the motorcycle crown.The triumph, in a grueling endurance event now run entirely in Peru and featuring cars, bikes and trucks, was a first for Japanese constructor Toyota.Spaniard Carlos Saint, last year’s car champion, won the closing 10th stage from Cisco with Al-Attiyah 12th and some nine minutes slower.Saint’s compatriot Nan Roman, in an X-Raid Mini, finished second overall with nine times rally world champion Sebastian Loeb, runner-up in the stage, completing the podium with a privately-entered Peugeot in the absence of a works entry.Al-Attiyah previous Dakar wins were with Volkswagen in 2011 and Mini in 2015.Overall runner-up in 2018, the 48-year-old led after every stage bar the second day in this year’s event when South African team mate Gin de Villagers was ahead.“It’s fantastic. No mistakes during the entire rally. It was a very, very difficult rally for everybody,�� said Al-Attiyah.“The good thing was that from day three we were leading and we built on our time every day until we came to the last day with a big, big lead.“We felt when we came that in Peru...with no other country, there would be a lot of sand dunes so we could do what we know we’re good at.”Price, battling a wrist injury suffered before the rally started, had led overnight but with only a minute between him and Chilean Pablo Quintal.The Australian clinched his second Dakar title, on a RTM, after he won the stage -- his first victory of this year’s event -- and Quintal fell.“Pretty much all I can say is that it feels like there are about five people driving a knife in my wrist now,�� said Price after 10 agonizing days of being jolted and bumped across the dunes and desert.“Now I’ll just wait and see what damage I’ve done to my wrist. At the end of the day, the pain and torture has been worth it.“I thought I would only be able to do two stages and then pull out and that would have been me done, but the support from everyone back home in Australia and then having some things go my way and a bit of luck, it just worked out in the end.”Russian Eduardo Nikolai secured his third successive Dakar title, and fourth in total, in the truck category with Kamal.For a photo essay of the Dakar Rally landscape reut.rs/2HhZkFe	-3.079377742
