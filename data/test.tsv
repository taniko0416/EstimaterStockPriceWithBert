"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has a ""good chance"" of selling a record number of luxury Lexus vehicles this year, an executive said, as a weaker yen adds to the brand's allure globally and in its biggest market the United States.The yen has lost about 20 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since mid-November, providing a boon to Lexus, which manufactures more than 80 percent of its vehicles in Japan, and then exports nearly 90 percent of these cars.Toyota sold a record 518,200 Lexus vehicles worldwide in 2007. Asked if the company can top that, Mark Templin, executive vice president of Lexus International, told Reuters on Friday: “There is a good chance of that this year.”�Lexus can be a vital contributor to TMC’s overall profitability. We have a business plan to make it that,�� he said, referring to Toyota Motor Corp.Lexus was the top selling luxury brand in the United States until 2011, when a huge earthquake and tsunami in Japan affected production. Globally, Lexus sales were hit by the 2008 financial crisis and the yen which until recently remained uncompetitively high for exporters.Sales are now recovering, with Toyota selling 476,500 Lexus vehicles globally in 2012, almost 18 percent more than the previous year.Toyota Motor Corp President Akio Toyoda took over the helm at Lexus in April, giving the brand more room to experiment with design and marketing. Lexus now sells a $10,000 roadbike and recently hosted a design competition.Koichi Sugimoto, an autos analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, said Lexus' operating margin could improve to around 20 percent this financial year from an estimated mid-single digit last year. Rival BMW BMWG.DE posted a 10.8 percent margin in 2012."	5.860080888
* New models, recovering Japanese automaker push up May car sales* Demand to stay solid thank to incentives - analyst* Toyota, GM, Nissan shines in May, Mazda lagsBEIJING, June 9 (Reuters) - Car sales in China rose 22.6 percent in May from a year earlier, according to data released on Saturday, extending the double-digit gain made in the previous month, as new models premiered at April’s Beijing autoshow started to hit the showrooms.In May a total of 1.28 million sedans, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) and minivans were sold in the country, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said. In the same month of 2011, that number was 1.04 million.From January to May, deliveries climbed 5.5 percent to 6.33 million, continuing an uptrend which started in April.The strong rebound by Toyota Motor and Honda Motor , which both suffered severe shortages of parts a year ago after northern Japan’s devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, also pushed up the monthly tally.Demand is likely to remain solid if Beijing renews some of its policy incentives which helped propel China beyond the U.S. as the world’s largest car market by volume in 2009, industry observers say.“The incentives will help bolster demand for minivans, and cheap cars like (the) QQ, which are popular in lower-tier cities and rural areas,�� said John Zeng, Asia Pacific director at industry consultancy LMC Automotive. “If such policy incentives do come out as expected, sales in the second half would definitely be better than the first half.”A source told Reuters late last month that Beijing would soon resume paying subsidies to rural residents who trade in old vehicles for new, fuel efficient ones to rekindle automobile demand amid a market slowdown.Beijing introduced a series of stimuli in 2009, including tax incentives for small cars, but China’s auto market slowed significantly in 2011 after the policies expired, with annual car sales climbing 5.2 percent, down from a 33 percent and 53 percent annual gains in 2010 and 2009 respectively.In the United States, automakers posted strong May sales gains from a year ago, but the sales rate still fell short of expectations as the broader economy softened.Toyota and Honda saw their China car sales jumped 105 percent and 92 percent respectively.General Motors maintained its leading position in China helped in part by a rebound in minivan sales, which contributed to about 55 percent of its monthly tally.SAIC Motor Corp, a longtime partner of GM and Volkswagen AG, was the big domestic winner with a year-on-year growth rate of 20.9 percent in May.	2.645852626
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by Takata Corp’s defective air bags told a U.S. judge on Tuesday there was “no basis�� for an “unjust�� request by the company’s U.S. unit to halt hundreds of consumer lawsuits against car companies that used the air bags.When the U.S. unit filed for bankruptcy in June, litigation against the unit for injuries, wrongful death, economic losses and breaches of consumer protection laws were automatically stayed.Last week, Takata’s U.S. unit asked for a preliminary injunction that would halt similar lawsuits against Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and other car companies that used the air bags.Halting the litigation would help Takata sell its healthy business to Key Safety Systems, which is owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, according to TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. unit. Funds from that $1.6 billion proposed sale will be used to compensate injured drivers, according to court papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.Plaintiffs lawyers, however, have said the U.S. bankruptcy is being used by automakers to protect themselves from spiraling litigation.The air bags, which degrade over time and inflate with too much force, have been tied to at least 17 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide.They are subject to the largest recall in automotive history which will eventually cover 125 million inflators, many of which still need to be replaced.The cost of the recall forced the Japanese company and TK Holdings into bankruptcy in June in Japan and the United States.At a hearing on Tuesday, attorney Dean Ziehl said there was “no basis�� to block claims against the automakers during the bankruptcy. He represents an official committee of injured drivers in the bankruptcy that was appointed earlier this month.Ziehl said the requested injunction was solely to benefit automakers.Adam Levitt, a lawyer for the state of New Mexico, which has sued Takata and automakers for violating consumer protection laws, called the request “unjust�� and “extraordinary.”U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon set an Aug. 9 hearing on the requested injunction, a schedule Ziehl criticized as “aggressive.�� Ziehl said his committee intended to seek “substantial, expedited discovery�� to investigate the motivation for requesting the injunction.The requested injunction would not affect a $553 million class action settlement over economic losses, which was reached with Toyota, BMW AG, Mazda Motor Co and Subaru Corp.	1.850501367

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Toyota’s zero-emission vehicle sales in California this year amount to a drop of hydrogen in an ocean of gasoline.The world’s largest automaker has so far sold about 270 hydrogen fuel cell cars in the state, where it delivered nearly 400,000 gas-powered vehicles last year, according to an Edmunds.com analysis of IHS Markit data. Toyota does not currently sell an electric vehicle.And yet the automaker will have no trouble meeting California’s zero-emission vehicle mandates - because it can satisfy those obligations with state-awarded environmental credits instead of current zero-emission vehicle sales.The Toyota example underscores how the California’s complex credit system has left the state well off the pace needed to meet its clean-car sales goals. The state has estimated its regulations would result in zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs, making up about 15 percent of all California auto sales by 2025, but the current share has been stuck at 3 percent since 2014.For a graphic detailing California and U.S. zero-emission vehicle sales, see: tmsnrt.rs/2bFa91IToyota and other automakers have amassed stockpiles of credits through past ZEV sales or by purchasing credits from competitors that produce more zero-emission cars, such as Tesla Motors or Nissan Motor Co. Some automakers have enough credits to satisfy state mandates for years without selling a single zero-emission vehicle, according to a new analysis from the Natural Resources Defense Council.The system also masks a more fundamental problem with the business of selling zero-emission vehicles - weak demand from consumers.The California Air Resources Board, which regulates greenhouse gas emissions, plans to take up ZEV program changes by December, with a likely focus on the credit system, the backbone of its policy. That prospect has ignited tensions between traditional automakers and Tesla, the Silicon Valley electric car maker.State regulators are caught in the middle, taking criticism from both sides. Mary Nichols, chair of the state board, acknowledged the sluggish sales of ZEVs, which include electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. She said regulatory changes could be needed to meet state sales goals.“I’m concerned,�� Nichols told Reuters in an interview. “It’s a very ambitious goal and would require - if you look at where we are today and where we need to go - a big change in what consumers are seeing and what they’re buying.”Any policy changes will be closely watched globally by automakers, regulators and environmentalists, many of whom view California as the leading laboratory for green-car policy.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk recently told investors that state regulators “should damn well be ashamed of themselves�� for failing to require major automakers to produce more zero-emission vehicles.Others in the industry argue car makers have only limited control over how quickly consumers embrace vehicles that - at least for now - are inherently expensive or impractical.“It’s a mandate for us to produce vehicles, but there is no mandate for customers to buy them,�� said Michael Lord, an executive engineer at Toyota who manages regulatory affairs.‘IT JUST TAKES TIME’Tesla has benefited from some automakers�� decisions to buy more credits instead of build more cars: The electric car maker has to date reported more than $600 million in environmental credit sales.The credits and related subsidies have helped finance Tesla’s success so far in creating consumer demand for high-end electric cars, but the company has yet to turn a profit from selling $100,000 sedans and crossovers. Its long-term growth depends on widespread consumer acceptance of more affordable battery-powered cars.Now, Toyota and Honda Motor Co. are building their own expensive, futuristic vehicles, ones that will net the companies far more credits than sales.Both automakers recently unveiled hydrogen fuel cell cars, which convert the fuel into electric power. They are essentially electric cars that can be refueled instead of recharged, which can take hours.Neither Toyota nor Honda expects these fuel cells to find a mass market. Hydrogen stations are nearly impossible to find outside of Los Angeles or San Francisco, and both cars start at about $60,000.But the Toyota Mirai and the Honda Clarity will pay off handsomely in credits - nine of them for each sale, compared to four credits the state now gives a Tesla Model S or the three it gives a Nissan Leaf.The credits are currently worth about $3,000 to $4,000 each, according to a source with knowledge of the private credit-trading market among automakers. But they are worth far more to Toyota and Honda as a mechanism to satisfy state mandates while continuing to sell hundreds of thousands of gasoline-powered vehicles each year in California, the nation’s biggest auto market.The credits also buy time to develop more viable zero-emissions cars, said Honda’s Robert Bienenfeld, assistant vice president for energy and the environment. The credits, he said, make it easier to carry out the difficult and expensive development work required to bring zero-emission vehicles into a tough market.“Things do not always go smoothly,�� he said.Toyota has spent two decades and billions of dollars on research and development of hydrogen fuel cells, and the company believes deeply in the technology, Lord said. But he does not expect hydrogen cars to serve a substantial market for at least five or ten more years.In the short term, that may mean fewer ZEV sales as a tradeoff for developing higher-quality vehicles with longer driving ranges. Getting the cars on the street, even in small numbers, is essential to jump-starting consumer demand and the hydrogen-fueling infrastructure needed for wider adoption, Lord said.“It just takes time,�� he said. “Just as with hybrids, every generation is better the one that came before.”Building the cars may be easier than selling them, especially with falling gas prices and rising gas mileage of traditional vehicles. Nationally, zero-emission vehicles still account for less than one percent of U.S. auto sales.Most customers continue to shun electric cars because of their limited driving range - often less than 100 miles - and long recharging times.Tesla and Chevrolet are planning new models that both companies say will start at about $35,000 and travel 200 miles on a charge, raising hopes of overcoming consumer concerns. Tesla’s Model 3 is scheduled to begin deliveries late in 2017, following the Chevy Bolt late this year.Toyota has been a global leader in pushing vehicle electrification, but with a focus on gas-electric hybrids, such as the Prius, more than all-electric cars.Toyota also believes in a middle ground between the two - plug-in hybrids, which can travel some distance on all-electric power before a gas engine kicks in.California plans to give automakers fewer credits for plug-in hybrids after 2018, a move Lord called ill-advised.“We think plug-in hybrids have a bigger role to play, particularly in this transitional phase of electrification,�� he said. “It removes that range anxiety issue.”The credit glut is the main concern of regulators, Tesla and environmental advocates. The Natural Resources Defense Council study predicts the industry’s zero-emission offerings will only reach 6 percent of annual sales by 2025, even after a planned tightening of regulations in 2018.Nichols, California’s top auto regulator, said she likes the idea of limiting the number of credits any automaker could redeem in any given year, which could force companies to sell more zero-emission cars. It could also devalue the credits, however, which would hurt Tesla’s bottom line.Tesla has a different proposal - one that would boost the value of its credit bank. The electric car maker proposes quadrupling the number of credits automakers need to satisfy state mandates.Earlier this month, Tesla’s Diarmuid O’Connell, vice president of business development, sparred with lobbyists for major automakers during a conference near Traverse City, Mich. He chided the industry for fielding electric cars that don’t sell because they are slow and have all the panache of household “appliances.”John Bozzella, head of a group that represents several Asian and European auto makers, countered that most consumers don’t want electric vehicles - and pointedly wished Tesla well in its quest to achieve profitability.Many automakers, having made major investments in part based on California policy, are wary of any substantial changes. Nissan makes the all-electric Leaf, along with a fleet of gasoline models, and so it has incentives to argue both sides of the debate. But the automaker would prefer if the state board left the program alone.“Nissan is concerned with any proposal that materially changes a regulation midstream,�� said Ken Srebnik, senior manager, Corporate Development at the company.Nichols said it’s “not impossible�� that the state could meet its goals for zero-emission car sales under current rules. But it’s not going to be easy, either.“I certainly can’t tell you I have a vision of exactly how it happens,�� she said.	-4.759543877
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Minnesota and New Mexico, in a rebuke to the Trump administration, plan to join 10 other states in adopting both of California’s tough rules on tailpipe emissions and zero-emission vehicles.The announcements came a week after President Donald Trump said his administration would strip California of the legal ability to regulate vehicle emissions.Minnesota and New Mexico would become the 11th and 12th states to adopt California’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate and the 14th and 15th states to adopt its tailpipe standards. Colorado said in August it would adopt the ZEV mandate.On Friday, a group of 23 states, including Minnesota and New Mexico, sued to block the Trump administration from undoing California’s authority to set strict car pollution rules, one of the biggest U.S. battles over climate change.The legal fight pits California, a Democratic-majority state that has become the U.S. environmental champion against a Republican president who wants to boost the economy by cutting regulation. The debate already is playing out ahead of the presidential election next year.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said on Wednesday the state planned to adopt the California rules but must first write regulations that would take at least 15 months. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said on Tuesday the state would adopt the standards by the end of 2020.Walz, a Democrat, said state residents would benefit from “cleaner air, more car options, and less money spent on gas.”�While President Trump threatens to rob New Mexico and indeed all states of a valuable tool for combating air pollution and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, New Mexico will stand up and deliver on our commitment to environmental leadership,�� said New Mexico’s Lujan Grisham, also a Democrat.California’s vehicle emissions rules, more stringent than the Trump EPA’s rules, are currently followed by states that account for more than 40% of U.S. vehicle sales.Minnesota Sierra Club Chapter Director Margaret Levin said the state was rejecting “the Trump administration’s indefensible attack on our communities and our future.”The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and others, said in a statement if a state ""is going to adopt the California mandate, it would need to make a massive investment in creating the necessary infrastructure to make the program work. That would include creating tax incentives, HOV lanes and in building charging stations across the state.""The U.S. Transportation Department said last week that federal law pre-empted state regulation of vehicle fuel economy, including California’s vehicle rules, while the Environmental Protection Agency said it was revoking a 2013 waiver California received to set emissions standards. Both changes do not take effect until November.The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option to freeze requirements.The Trump administration escalated its fight on Tuesday with California by threatening to withdraw billions of dollars in federal highway funds because of poor California air quality."	0.01445922499

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers like Honda Motor Co 7267.T and the Toyota-Daihatsu group 7203.T7262.T have a problem: the smallest cars they make are very big in Japan - and only Japan.Consider Honda’s hi-tech N BOX, a four-passenger microcar that combines some of the utility features of a much larger SUV - the seats roll down to load a bicycle or two - and the fuel-sipping economy of a tiny, 660-cc engine.For the first half of 2013, the zippy N BOX was the best-selling car in Japan’s popular vehicle category that now represents almost 40 percent of vehicles on the road.But outside Japan, the concept of the so-called kei car, a term derived from the Japanese word light, is mostly unknown. Now that could change. The Japanese auto giants are considering exporting the technology to emerging market countries.“We have fairly low-priced cars in those markets already, but in India and markets like Indonesia, we need even smaller, even more affordable cars,�� Honda’s chief spokesman Masaya Nagai said.Rising fuel costs and a fast growing middle class in the world’s second and fourth most populous states make them likely to be the first microcar customers.As a first step, companies such as Honda have designed their kei cars - the kei is pronounced like the letter “k�� - in a way that makes it easier to produce them overseas.“We spent a long time nurturing the kei car technology in Japan, and we think it has the potential to be useful not only in developed markets but also in emerging markets,�� Honda’s Chief Executive Officer Takanobu Ito told reporters in June.Honda is not alone.Toyota Motor Corp is using technology from its affiliate Daihatsu Motor Co, a kei-car specialist, to develop minicars for Indonesia.Mitsbubishi Motors Corp 7211.T is looking at selling kei-concept cars in Africa, where President Osamu Masuko plans to attend a distributors' conference this month. Nissan's Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga also said last month that kei cars have a potential of going global.While few Japanese carmakers have tried to popularize microcars outside of Japan, there are exceptions.Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Daihatsu have targeted India and Southeast Asia since the early 1980s, building a credible presence although their technology differs from that used to build Honda's kei.More recently, General Motors Co GM.N and its Chinese affiliate Wuling have been making an aggressive push for micro minivans in China. Their next bet is India.Honda believes its advanced microcar technology and the favorable marketing conditions in India and Indonesia mean that the time is right to export the kei concept.Joost Geginat, an autos market expert with Roland Berger consultancy in Singapore, predicts Japanese companies will invest a total $1.8 billion to produce kei-concept cars in Indonesia.Now the race in the microcar market is heating up. Honda, Japan’s No.3 automaker most famous for its Civic and Accord cars, is betting on small cars to meet its aggressive target of selling 6 million vehicles globally a year by March 2017 from current sales of around 4 million.To do so, Honda aims to double sales in emerging markets to account for half of total vehicle sales, and its kei car technology could play a key role in that.Indonesia, where over a million cars were sold last year, is one such market. Last month, Jakarta rolled back fuel subsidies, raising motor fuel prices by an average of 33 percent. At around the same time, Indonesia signed into law a Low Cost Green Car (LCGC) program to promote small cars such as the kei, though it is on hold pending review.Geginat says Toyota, Daihatsu, Suzuki and Honda could roll out a combined 500,000 LCGCs, valued at under at $10,000 each, a year once the new law is in place.Honda is looking at taking the microcar technology to Indonesia and neighboring Malaysia, Hiroshi Takemura, who oversees Honda’s small car operations, told Reuters last month.The company has designed its N BOX to share certain structures with the Fit, Honda’s global compact car also known as the Jazz, meaning the two cars can be manufactured on the same line, said Yoshiyuki Matsumoto, Honda’s managing officer.Honda currently builds the Fit or Jazz at 10 plants around the world, including Indonesia and Thailand.One challenge for Honda and other Japanese automakers is pricing. Honda’s N BOX starts from around $12,500, slightly more expensive than the outgoing model of the Fit that starts from about $12,200.To produce a sub $10,000 no-frills car in Indonesia, features like the turbocharger, vehicle assist system and airbags may have to go, and an old-fashioned key used to start the car instead of an electronic smart key.($1 = 101.0850 Japanese yen)	-0.285405739
BOSTON (Reuters) - A man in Florida has been charged with witness tampering and obstruction of justice in a gun-trafficking case linked to the murder trial of ex-National Football League star Aaron Hernandez, authorities said on Thursday.Oscar Hernandez, who is not related to former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, was arrested on Wednesday and will be brought to Massachusetts to face the charges, the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston said in a statement.Aaron Hernandez has been in jail since June on charges he and two associates fatally shot semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd near his home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. He has pleaded not guilty.Authorities investigating Lloyd’s murder found three guns that they determined were bought in Florida in April 2013. One of the guns was found inside a gray Toyota Camry with a Florida license plate that was parked in the garage of a North Attleboro house, according to the indictment against Oscar Hernandez.The indictment did not identify the owner of the house, but the Boston Globe newspaper, citing a law enforcement source, reported it that belonged to Aaron Hernandez.The indictment claims Oscar Hernandez lied to a Florida grand jury when he denied buying the Camry and shipping it to the house, and that he tampered with a witness when he attempted to “influence the testimony�� of the person from whom he had purchased the car.	-0.02761413844
TOKYO, June 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s transport ministry has ordered carmakers including Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co to decide as soon as possible whether they need to recall more vehicles over potentially faulty air bags made by Takata Corp.The instruction to Honda, Nissan, Mazda Motor Corp and the Japanese arm of BMW came after Toyota on Wednesday expanded last year’s recall saying Takata had not fully provided serial numbers of potentially flawed air bag inflators.Takata has said it supports Toyota’s decision to expand the recall and that it will provide the replacement inflators.Some of those car makers could decide by the end of this month whether to recall more vehicles, two individuals knowledgeable about the matter said.The transport ministry also asked Japan’s auto lobby to tell car makers to pay close attention to the information Toyota released in pulling back 2.3 million vehicles globally, many for the second time.Last year, automakers including Toyota, Honda and Nissan recalled a total of 3.6 million vehicles globally over Takata air bags.On Wednesday, Toyota recalled 650,000 more vehicles in Japan that had not been included in last year’s recall. As a result, the total number of Toyota vehicles recalled in Japan over this issue has more than tripled to around 960,000 vehicles from the 310,000 vehicles it had recalled in 2013.Overseas, Toyota recalled 1.62 million vehicles for the second time, many in the United States.Since late 2008, automakers have called back more than 7 million vehicles with Takata air bags globally, many of that recalled by Honda.

EditorsNote: adds quotes, detailsIn the lead-up to Sunday’s season-ending Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, driver Joey Logano referred to the four remaining championship contenders as “the big three and me.”In the darkness of the South Florida swamps, it was a tear-soaked “me�� hoisting the big, silver championship trophy in victory lane at the 1.5-mile oval following the Ford EcoBoost 400.The season championship was Logano’s first after 363 starts. The Team Penske driver led a race-best 80 laps in getting it. His margin of victory was 1.7 seconds.“We did it,�� he said. “We won the championship. I can’t believe it. I don’t even know what to say.”The Big Three -- as past champions Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch were dubbed after piling up 20 victories in 2018 between them -- headed out of Homestead with finishes of second, third and fourth, respectively.In victory lane, the 28-year-old Logano, from Middletown, Conn., was asked if he really thought he was the underdog.“No,�� he said. “We proved why we’re not. This is the favorite.”Of his emotions, he said that on his way to the checkered flag on the last lap there was “just a lot of screamin��. Lot of screamin��. I think I pulled a muscle.“We’re champions,�� he reminded himself afterward, “NASCAR champions.”Logano’s winning move came with 12 laps to go when he passed defending race and Cup champion Truex for the lead. From there, he sprinted to the easy win.All of the Championship 4 drivers led laps and all had shots at the win and title, but Logano was the one shedding tears of joy.Truex, whose Furniture Row Racing team will shut down operations after the season, was asked about getting out of his No. 78 Toyota for the last time.“Not sure yet,�� he said, fighting back tears. “Going to miss these guys. Wish we could have won it.”�They made me a superstar in NASCAR,�� he said of FRR.Harvick, winner of eight races in 2018 in his Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, said, “We just got loose as the night went on.”�It’s been a great year. We just got beat tonight.”Busch, whose team struggled with getting his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota right, was calm afterward.“Not at all what we wanted. Not what we expected either,�� Busch said. “Didn’t have the feel in the race car I wanted.“Just not good enough on the night that mattered the most,�� the winner of eight races this season said. “We finished fourth. Last of the (Championship 4) guys.”Notable season-ending facts:--Jimmie Johnson went an entire season without winning a race for the first time since become a full-time Cup driver in 2002. The seven-time champ and crew chief Chad Knaus will part ways after the season, as was previously announced.--Denny Hamlin also failed to win a race for the first time since he became a full-timer in 2006.--The race started a bit late, for two reasons. First, a parachuter participating in pre-race ceremonies got his chute tangled on the front stretch catch fence and it took a while to get him down from the fence. Then, an oil leak on a car starting near the back of the field brought out track workers.--Among the non-Championship 4 drivers, Brad Keselowski led the way with a fifth-place finish. He was followed, in order, by Matt Kenseth, Chase Elliott, Clint Bowyer, Aric Almirola and Kurt Busch.--Field Level Media	1.912241762
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - A former executive of Japanese auto parts maker T.RAD Co Ltd was indicted on Thursday on one charge of fixing the prices of radiators sold to car makers, the Justice Department said.Michitaka Sakuma, former executive managing director of T.RAD, was accused of coordinating with other auto parts makers to illegally set the prices of radiators sold to Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp, the department said.Sakuma, a member of the company’s board of directors, was a general manager for T.RAD in charge of Toyota sales but rose to executive managing director for all sales, according to an indictment filed in federal court.He is the second T.RAD executive to face criminal charges.T.RAD is among 35 companies which have pleaded guilty to fixing the prices of dozens of car parts. A total of 53 executives have been charged with price-fixing or rigging bids of auto parts in the long-running probe.The case is United States of America v. Michitaka Sakuma. It is filed at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is case No. 15-20290. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Eric Beech and Christian Plumb)	-2.769606085
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would meet the head of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday, as Tokyo compiles a plan to ward off U.S. criticism of Japanese trade policy before a summit with President Donald Trump next week.Trump, who has pledged to put America first when it comes to trade, has rattled Japan by criticizing the low number of U.S. cars sold in Japan and by demanding that more cars sold in the United States be made locally.Abe, speaking in parliament on Thursday, said the meeting was arranged months ago, but this will do little to quell speculation that he will pass on some instructions to Japan’s top auto maker about how to avoid Trump’s protectionist ire.The stakes are high because Japan’s politically powerful auto industry is a major contributor to exports and economic growth. If Trump curbs Japanese auto exports, either from Japan or from plants in Mexico, this could slow Japan’s economy.“I did not suddenly summon the head of Toyota (because of U.S. criticism),�� Abe said.“This meeting was planned months ago. I cannot tell private-sector companies what to do. The United State thinks the same way.”Abe and Toyota President Akio Toyoda are set to meet at 6:30 p.m. on Friday at a hotel restaurant in Tokyo to exchange views on auto production in North America and other issues, a person involved in the meeting arrangements said.Some Japanese policymakers worry Trump will consider limits on Japanese auto imports, which make up about 75 percent of Japan’s trade surplus with the United States.Toyota should be considered a U.S. manufacturer because it already makes cars in the United States, Toyoda said on Thursday. Toyoda also told reporters that his meeting with Abe was unconfirmed.Japan’s government is hammering out plans to show Trump its firms are ready to create U.S. jobs, according to a document whose contents were revealed to Reuters.Abe will visit Washington on Feb. 10 for the talks, at which Trump is expected to seek quick progress toward a bilateral trade deal.Japan is also considering increasing U.S. shale oil or gas imports, two sources said, which could be another way to ease U.S. concern about its trade deficit with Japan.	-1.414476556

FRANKFURT, March 10 (Reuters) - Germany’s BMW said it saw strong demand for the i8 hybrid sportscar which will go into series production in April and start customer deliveries in June.“Demand for the BMW i8 is already exceeding the planned production volume during ramp-up,�� BMW said in a statement on Monday, without giving a more specific figure for how many cars will be made during this phase.Green cars, and electric vehicles in particular remain a niche product, because their limited vehicle range limits their use when compared with gasoline or diesel-powered cars.Market leader Nissan, Toyota, General Motors and VW’s Audi have trimmed electric-car plans or have had to offer aggressive pricing to spur their middling sales.To give the carbon fibre car an operating range of up to 600 kilometres (373 miles), the 362-horsepower i8 is powered by a hybrid system.This combines a 96 kilowatt electric motor driving the front wheels, and a turbo charged 231-horsepower three-cylinder petrol engine.	-8.06508981
BOWMAVILLE, ONTARIO - Past NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series races on the historical and scenic Canadian Tire Motorsport Park road course have ended in hot tempers and dramatic last-lap passes.By comparison, Brett Moffitt’s 5.160-second victory in Sunday’s Chevrolet Silverado 250 looked like a drive in the Park. The current series championship leader earned his second playoff win in as many 2019 playoff races with the largest margin of victory in the race’s seven-year history over one of the very best road course racers in the world -- Canadian Alex Tagliani.Ben Rhodes finished third followed by Sheldon Creed. Austin Hill and Johnny Sauter got around another Canadian, fellow truck series playoff driver Stewart Friesen, on the last lap to round out the top-six. Friesen still had a solid day, an impressive rally from last place on the starting grid to seventh at the checkered flag -- forced to conserve fuel down the homestretch.Four of the first six series races at the track were decided on the final lap. This year for Moffitt’s strong No. 24 GMS Racing Chevrolet team, it was instead a matter of making a strong statement -- earning a convincing win and extending his playoff win streak to two with the final race of this opening playoff round set for Sept. 13 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.Going back to the 2018 season -- the defending series champion Moffitt has won four consecutive playoff races.“As far as the team goes, I just feel like everyone at GMS all the way back from the fab shop on up has been doing a better job,’� said Moffitt, who led 45 of the 64 laps. “Our team personally has been communicating a lot better and just knowing what my words mean and what I need to find in the truck, I’d say we’re hitting our stride at the right time.“It took a while to get here but before it was like we were missing a little bit everywhere and now we’re hitting on all cylinders.”Playoff driver Ross Chastain finished eighth and his nine laps led, along with Rhodes, marked the most by any driver other than Moffitt. Among the other playoff drivers, Tyler Ankrum finished ninth, Matt Crafton was 11th and regular season champion Grant Enfinger was 13th.There were only three caution flags on the afternoon -- two for stage endings.As has often been the case in this seven-year-old event, again the action intensified in the final laps. This year it was behind the leader.Harrison Burton lost a motor while running in the top-five with two laps remaining, but was able to get off the track without bringing out a caution flag. The driver racing him hardest at the time, Friesen, had to back off himself to save fuel on the final lap.“It was a battle for sure,’� Friesen said. “I screwed up in practice and wrecked the primary. But we were able to battle up through there and almost had a top-five but started running out of fuel at the end.“We gave up a couple positions at the end but still got out of here with some points.”Two of the eight drivers will be eliminated from championship contention following the final playoff race of this round at Las Vegas in two weeks. With his two victories, Moffitt has an automatic berth in the next round. Chastain is second in the championship points standings, with a 22-point advantage on third-place Friesen.Crafton is fourth in the championship standings, followed by Hill and Enfinger. Only four points separate Friesen, Crafton, Hill and Enfinger, however.The two-time series champion Sauter sits a mere two points behind his ThorSport Racing teammate Enfinger just outside the playoff bubble and 18-year-old Ankrum is 14 points below the cutoff.“You go into Vegas with a must-win mentality, that’s what I know I’ll do.’� Sauter said.7th Annual Chevrolet Silverado 250, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Bowmanville, Ontario1.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp has partnered with Chinese autonomous driving startup Momenta to develop a high definition (HD) mapping platform in China for autonomous driving vehicles, Momenta said in a statement.Maps are key to allowing autonomous vehicles to locate themselves. Toyota’s research arm is developing its so-called Automated Mapping Platform (AMP) to generate data for accurate and updated maps, which it said will also be accessible to industry developers.Momenta was established three years ago and is backed by German’s Daimler. It is testing autonomous cars in Beijing and Suzhou and will provide its camera-based HD mapping technologies to help commercialize Toyota’s AMP in China, according to the statement.Toyota autonomous vehicle partnerships also include a venture with SoftBank Corp and an investment in robotaxi developer Uber ATG.It has invested $400 million in Pony.ai, another autonomous company with a Chinese background, and $600 million in Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and a new joint venture to develop mobility services.	7.357629017
(Adds company comment, analyst quote)SHANGHAI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd posted a 23 percent slump in July China vehicle sales, its biggest decline in 17 months, casting doubts over the company’s full-year sales target in the world’s biggest auto market.Honda had said it aims to increase China sales by 18.9 percent this year, but during the first seven months, sales only grew 6.9 percent.A Honda spokeswoman attributed the decline to tough competition, and a seasonal decline in demand, among other factors, but said sales were expected to rebound in the second half of the year after the company launched new models.Honda is expected to launch around September a small utility vehicle and a cross-over utility version of the Honda Fit, to take advantage of these vehicles�� popularity in China.Rival automaker Toyota Motor Corp also saw China sales fall 1.1 percent in July and 7.6 percent from a year earlier. Toyota sales have been weak because it is still ramping up production of the newly redesigned Corolla model, which went on sale in China recently, company officials said.Honda and its two local joint ventures sold 39,543 automobiles in China in July, down 22.7 percent from the same month a year ago and also lower than the 15.8 percent year-on-year increase in JuneThe July decline is the biggest monthly fall since February 2013, when Japanese carmakers were still suffering from a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment in China triggered by a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.Honda’s China sales in the first seven months of the year came to 392,959 vehicles, up 6.9 percent from the same period a year earlier.Honda, which operates car ventures in China with Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd , has said it aims to sell 900,000 cars in China this year.The automaker will double the number of car models it sells in China over the next two years to increase its market share, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported in May.

(Reuters) - Automakers and parts suppliers have shut factories in China, in line with government guidelines, or have flagged a hit to profits following the coronavirus outbreak.Below is a list of announcements by car companies, in alphabetical order.- BMW BMWG.DE said production at its plant in Shenyang will resume on Feb. 17.- Daimler DAIGn.DE said it plans to resume passenger car production in Beijing on Feb. 10.- Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI warned on Thursday that disruption to parts supplies could threaten production at one of its European plants within two to four weeks.- Ford Motor F.N plans to resume production on Feb. 10 at its factories in Chongqing and Hangzhou with joint venture partner Chongqing Changan Automobile 000625.SZ. Ford this week excluded any potential impact from its already weaker-than-expected forecast for the year, saying it was too early to make an estimate.- Honda 7267.T confirmed on Friday it would restart its three plants in Wuhan, which it operates with Dongfeng Motor Group 0489.HK, on Feb. 13. Honda, which raised its annual profit forecast on Friday, said there were currently no supply chain issues that would impede production.- Hyundai Motor 005380.KS said this week it would suspend production in South Korea due to the outbreak disrupting its supply chain, the first major automaker to do so outside China. Most of Hyundai's South Korean plants will be shut from Feb. 7, with some production lines expected to restart on Feb. 11 or Feb. 12, a union official said.- Nissan Motor 7201.T said it is considering restarting production in China at its venture with Dongfeng sometime after Feb. 10. Production in Hubei will start sometime after Feb. 14, it said. - PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA, which is in the process of merging with Fiat, said last week its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until Feb. 14.- Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T said on Friday it was considering sourcing vehicle components from outside China because the outbreak is threatening to disrupt vehicle production in its biggest market, India.- Tesla TSLA.O said last week that a delay to an increase in production in Shanghai due to a factory closure would hit profitability slightly. On Wednesday, a senior executive said Tesla would delay deliveries of Model 3 sedans built in that plant. The company is also evaluating whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California, plant will be affected.- Toyota Motor 7203.T on Friday extended the shutdown of its China factories from Feb. 9 to Feb 16. The Japanese automaker operates 12 car and parts factories in regions such as the northern city of Tianjin and the southern province of Guangdong.- Valeo VLOF.PA, a French car parts maker, said last week its three sites in Wuhan will remain shut until at least Feb. 13. On Wednesday, it said it was not experiencing any major disruption to its supply chain in China.- Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE has postponed restarting production at most China plants in its joint venture with SAIC Motor 600104.SS and the Tianjin plant in its JV with FAW Group until Feb. 17. One plant Volkswagen operates with SAIC in Shanghai and most of the plants in the FAW JV will restart on Feb. 10. The German carmaker said it was facing supply chain challenges as China returns to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, as well as limited travel options for its employees.	-10.11466591
* German car market actually down 3.6 pct adj -economist* Hyundai more popular than most import brands* Every fourth car sold sports a VW logo on grilleFRANKFURT, FEB 2 - South Korean automaker Hyundai and its affiliate Kia in January posted huge gains in the stagnant German car market, Europe’s largest, official data showed on Thursday.Luxury brands Audi and Mercedes-Benz, whose individual market shares dwarf most volume brands in Germany, also enjoyed healthy gains as BMW suffered ahead of this month’s relaunch of its best-selling 3 Series.Data from Germany’s motor vehicle authority KBA revealed a poor performance for many other brands including Renault , GM’s Opel, Nissan, Peugeot and Toyota, which all saw new registrations fall between 8 and 17 percent.Even the Volkswagen marque saw demand slip 2.3 percent in January, more than the 0.4 percent drop recorded for the overall market. Nonetheless, almost one in four newly registered vehicles in Germany sported a VW logo on the grille.Korean brands Hyundai and Kia, which have invested heavily in their styling and design, combined for a 2.4 percentage point gain in share over last January.Hyundai’s new vehicle registrations jumped by half, while Kia’s more than doubled last month, giving them a combined 5.5 percent of the market.The larger of the two, Hyundai, with 3.6 percent of the market, was more popular in January than rival brands Nissan, Fiat, Peugeot, Toyota and even Citroen, which came the closest at 2.9 percent.Excluding Ford, the only import brand that surpassed Hyundai was Renault, though KBA did not provide figures that adjusted for the inclusion of the Renault group’s Dacia brand, which is targeted at the lower end of the market.Economists at Barclays Capital calculated Germany’s car market declined by 3.6 percent when adjusted for seasonal and working-day effects, putting its annual rate of 3.15 million about 6 percent off the long-term average.“We see scope for the German car market to remain in positive territory, but admittedly this will depend on the speed at which the euro area sovereign debt crisis is resolved,�� Barclays wrote in a research note.Domestic vehicle production, a key barometer of economic output and a future driver of employment, increased 12 percent to 445,000 cars, according to figures from the German auto industry lobby VDA.	6.23774029
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it will wind down its Scion brand in the United States, ending a 12-year effort to create a separate identity for small cars aimed at young buyers.Toyota said it will start rebadging three 2017 model Scion cars as Toyotas starting in August. The Scion tC small coupe will go out of production in August, Toyota said.Scion sales peaked at 173,034 vehicles in 2006, but have trended down since. Toyota sold 56,167 Scion vehicles in 2015, a decline of 68 percent in a U.S. market that favors larger sport utility vehicles and trucks.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said last week it would phase out production of its Dodge Dart small car and mid-sized Chrysler 200 sedan, and seek partners to produce replacements, because profits for the smaller cars had evaporated.Toyota said it had no plans to scale back small car sales.Toyota established Scion as a separate brand for a series of models originally designed for the Japanese market. The brand, sold through Toyota’s U.S. dealer network, had an early hit with a small, boxy micro-wagon called the xB.More recently, Scion’s successful FR-S sporty coupe harkened back to iconic Toyota cars such as the Celica of the 1970s. The FR-S will be rebadged as a Toyota.Toyota used Scion to test efforts to attract more young buyers, at a time when some core Toyota brand models tended to appeal to customers cruising into retirement.Half of Scion buyers were aged below 35, a group which accounted for 27 percent of Toyota sales and was expected to grow, the company said.“Scion has allowed us to fast-track ideas that would have been challenging to test through the Toyota network,�� Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz said in a statement. Lentz was the founding vice president of the Scion brand.Efforts to target young buyers would not end with Scion, but would transition to the Toyota brand, executives said.A spokeswoman said Toyota would realize “efficiencies�� from not having to promote a separate brand, but declined to provide figures.	-5.582290664
MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Global automakers reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic are accelerating efforts to restart factories from Wuhan to Maranello to Michigan, using safety protocols developed for China and U.S. ventilator production operations launched in recent weeks.Certain safety measures differ from manufacturer to manufacturer. Italian sports car maker Ferrari NV RACE.MI said on Wednesday it would offer voluntary blood tests to employees who wanted to know if they had been exposed to the virus.General Motors Co's GM.N head of workplace safety, Jim Glynn, told Reuters on Wednesday GM is not persuaded blood tests are useful. But Glynn said GM has studied and adapted measures taken by Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O to protect warehouse workers, such as temperature screening to catch employees with fevers before they enter the workplace.Auto manufacturers and suppliers are converging on a consensus that temperature screening, daily health questionnaires, assembly lines redesigned to keep workers 3 to 6 feet (0.9 m to 1.8 m) apart, and lots and lots of masks and gloves can enable large-scale factories to operate safely.“We know the protocols to keep people safe,�� Gerald Johnson, GM’s executive vice president for global manufacturing, told Reuters in an interview. GM has relaunched vehicle plants in China and kept factories running in South Korea, he said.GM has not said when it will reopen assembly plants in the United States. Other automakers are putting dates out in public, even though health officials and federal and state policymakers are wary of lifting lockdowns too soon.“You see vehicle manufacturers ... putting a stake in the ground,�� said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group’s automotive practice. By setting a public date to restart production, they signal suppliers to get ready to ramp up, he said.The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the global auto industry into the worst tailspin since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Consumer demand for vehicles has collapsed as governments have enforced lockdowns in China, and then in Europe and the United States. For the Detroit automakers and their suppliers, the shutdown of profitable truck and sport utility vehicle plants in North America has choked off cash flow.In Europe, major automakers have said they hope to begin building vehicles again in mid-to-late April. In the United States, several big automakers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, are aiming to restart production during the first week of May.Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and unions are discussing plans for beefed-up health measures at Italian plants to pave the way for production to restart as soon as the government eases a national lockdown due to expire on April 13, unions said on Wednesday.Among the proposals from Fiat Chrysler’s Italian unions: move meals to the end of shifts, allowing employees to chose to avoid canteens, eat their food elsewhere and leave half an hour earlier without losing pay.FCA did not comment on specific measures.In the United States, some non-union automakers have also said they hope to restart vehicle plants as soon as next week.Tire maker Bridgestone said on Wednesday it plans to restart U.S. production on April 13.But the Trump administration has said people should continue to practice social distancing until April 30.For the Detroit automakers, the United Auto Workers union will play a key role in deciding when and how plants will restart.UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement on Wednesday the union is in “deep discussions with all three companies to plan ahead over the implementation of CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] safety standards and using all available technologies to protect all UAW members, their families and the public.”Among the union’s concerns is that members who report being ill can take time away from work without penalty, Gamble added.The UAW has supported GM and Ford Motor Co's F.N efforts to launch production of ventilators in U.S. plants - operations that have allowed the companies and the union to road-test safety measures at small scale.At GM’s ventilator assembly plant in Kokomo, Indiana, workers and managers have been fine-tuning details such as when employees are handed masks, and when they step in front of a temperature screening device.At first, ventilator assemblers in training at Kokomo walked down a hall before getting a mask, said Debby Hollis, one of the UAW-represented workers. Last week, she said, “They met us at the door and had us get in the masks there.”The time workers spend putting on extra protective gear, the time spent doing extra cleaning, and spreading workers out on assembly lines designed to have one vehicle roll off the end every 60 seconds could undercut productivity.“If we can protect employees we can get work done,�� said Johnson, the GM manufacturing chief. “The magnitude of the incremental cost is irrelevant. Costs will be managed.��	0.1701644923
* Biggest single recall since Ford in 1996* Window switches may cause fire, emit smoke* Switches can be repaired in 40 mins - spokeswoman* Recalls include 2.47 mln vehicles in the U.S.* No accidents, deaths or injuries reported-spokeswomanBy Yoko KubotaTOKYO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it would recall more than 7.4 million vehicles worldwide for faulty power window switches that are a potential fire hazard, the latest in a series of setbacks that have dented the reputation of Japan’s biggest automaker.The voluntary move is the biggest single recall since Ford pulled 8 million vehicles off the road in 1996 to replace defective ignition switches that could have caused engine fires.Toyota has battled its way back from multiple difficulties since 2008, including a series of recalls involving more than 10 million of its vehicles in 2009-11, and crippled supply chains from last year’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand. It posted its biggest quarterly operating profit in four years in April-June.The firm regained its crown as the world’s best-selling automaker in the first half year and expects to sell 9.76 million cars and light trucks globally this year, including the Daihatsu and Hino brands.More recently, though, Toyota - and other Japanese brands - have seen sales plummet in China, the world’s biggest autos market, as a result of protests in a simmering Sino-Japanese territorial dispute. Toyota said on Tuesday that its China sales fell 48.9 percent year-on-year in September. Sales in China account for about 12 percent of its total.The recall, intended to fix a malfunctioning power window switch on the driver’s side, primarily affects cars in the United States, China and Europe.Toyota’s main rivals in the United States include Ford and General Motors Co, while in China they include Volkswagen AG, Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd, and in Europe, Hyundai and Nissan.The recall will include some Yaris and Corolla models, with repairs taking about 40 minutes, the company said.“The process to repair (the power window switch) is not an extensive one,�� spokeswoman Monika Saito said, adding that it would involve putting heat-resistant grease on the switches, or exchanging them.Toyota declined to say how much the recall would cost, or what impact it may have on future earnings.Koichi Sugimoto, senior analyst at BNP Paribas Securities in Tokyo, estimated the recall could cost at least 10 billion yen ($128 million).“Of course, 7 million vehicles is a huge number, but it’s probably not going to be like last time when customers in the United States avoided buying Toyota cars. This sounds like a completely different scale from then,�� he said.U.S. auto analysts and dealers were split on the impact the massive recall will have on Toyota’s reputation, from a mild speed bump that will be quickly overcome to a damaging sideswipe that will send some customers to other brands.Despite the massive size of the recall, the defect itself is “pretty minor,�� said Carl Swope, chairman of Toyota’s National Dealer Advisory Council, adding the company has been proactive in addressing safety concerns since 2008, including recalls for sticky accelerators and accelerators that could be pinned down by loose floormats.“I don’t think that the dealers are concerned at all about the impact,�� Swope said. “This kind of recall is almost a testament to Toyota and their resolve to absolutely address any issue.”But others disagreed. “Toyota’s had so many hard hits and so many issues in the past few years,�� said Jim Ziegler, a Georgia-based consultant to auto dealers.While recalls from 2009 to 2011 were “beyond their control�� this current problem was “foreseeable engineering,�� Ziegler said.Ziegler said that both Toyota and Honda Motor Co have well-earned reputations for quality among U.S. consumers, but that both Japanese automakers have taken content out of their vehicles in order to keep prices down amid fierce competition, particularly from Hyundai and its stablemate, Kia Motors Co.George Cook, professor of business at the University of Rochester in New York who worked for Ford and Xerox Corp in marketing, said the spate of recent recalls at Toyota “will hurt their reputation and image eventually.“People are going to say, ‘Are they as safe a bet now as they used to be?�� said Cook.John O’Dell, senior editor at Edmunds.com, said that consumer consideration of Toyota vehicles may take a slight hit but is not likely to suffer long-term damage due to the latest recall.“It took a long time for the big Japanese companies to develop their ironclad reputations�� for making quality vehicles, said O’Dell, referring to Honda as well as Toyota.O’Dell said he expected Toyota’s loyal U.S. customers to stick with the automaker, in part because this particular recall does not seem imminently dangerous.The recall will include 2.47 million vehicles in the United States, 1.4 million in China and 1.39 million in Europe, the company said.No accidents, injuries or deaths have been reported as a result of the problem, though there is a possibility the malfunctioning switches could emit smoke, Saito said. Toyota’s U.S. news release said the problem could lead to fire if commercially available lubricants were used on the switch.Toyota will take in for repair about 459,300 vehicles in Japan, including the Vitz model, produced between 2006 and 2008.The firm is also recalling 650,000 vehicles in Australia and Asia, 490,000 in the Near and Middle East, 240,000 in Canada and 330,000 elsewhere, said Shino Yamada, another spokeswoman for Toyota.The vehicles recalled outside Japan include some models of the Yaris, Vios, Corolla, Matrix, Auris, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia, xB and xD produced between 2005 and 2010.The first time the problem was reported was in September 2008 in the United States, Saito said.Shares in Toyota ended down 1.9 percent on Wednesday, in line with the broader Nikkei index.	3.80761523
PARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - Renault RENA.PA, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T ruled out a merger on Wednesday and doubled down on a plan to cooperate more closely on car production to save costs and salvage their troubled alliance.The companies have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic just as they were trying to rework their partnership following the arrest of its chief architect, Carlos Ghosn, who had been pushing for a merger despite stiff resistance from Nissan.The new plan, which entails cutting the alliance’s vehicle ranges by a fifth, pooling manufacturing by region and capitalising on joint designs, is meant to serve as a peace treaty, sources have told Reuters.“We don’t need a merger to be efficient,�� Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told a joint news conference.He also said existing ties with Germany's Daimler DAIGn.DE, which owns Mercedes-Benz, could be strengthened and that he hoped to make an announcement in the coming weeks.Renault and Nissan were among the weakest global automakers going into the coronavirus crisis and had lacked a clear plan for using their alliance to emerge from the slump and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles and other technology.Rivals such as Peugeot PEUP.PA and Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI, have been pushing ahead with plans to share costs and designs while the two biggest carmakers, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Toyota 7203.T, already operate as single units.Renault shares, which have been depressed by the tensions with Nissan and the French carmaker’s first loss in a decade in 2019, surged by almost 20% following Wednesday’s announcements.Daimler shares jumped as much as 10% while Nissan closed 5.5% higher.Renault is also on course to receive 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion)in French state aid although the government wants it to keep car manufacturing in France in return.For a graphic on alliance profits and sales, please click on: tmsnrt.rs/2zo3F6GUnder their new plan, the alliance aims to make savings by sharing production in a so-called leader-follower system, with one company leading for a certain type of vehicle and geography with the others piggy-backing on the designs and manufacturing.Senard said that would help cut costs, with joint savings on future compact sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) coming to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion).In Brazil, for example, the new approach means the alliance will go from making six models on four platforms - or underlying vehicle architectures - to seven models on one platform.A tighter design and development process at the alliance, whose best-known cars include the Renault Clio compact hatchback, the Nissan Rogue crossover SUV and the Mitsubishi Outlander SUV, would reduce it total number of models by 20% by 2025 from well over 80 now.Some analysts pointed to potential problems, however, saying the three companies remained locked in a partnership while some larger rivals were not constrained by structural limitations.“The way this plan has been designed is to avoid stepping on each others�� toes, but there could be some efficiency losses, as there are boundaries they have to respect,�� said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA.Renault, Nissan and junior partner Mitsubishi, which joined the alliance in 2016, have clashed previously due to differences in corporate cultures and opposing views over structures.Renault owns 43% of Nissan while it has 15% of the French carmaker but no voting rights. Nissan has resisted proposals for a full-blown merger as executives felt Renault was not paying its fair share for the engineering work it did in Japan.The strategy is a departure from Ghosn’s focus on growth and volumes that led to excess capacity. Renault and Nissan, which is set to post a net loss in its latest fiscal year, are now hoping to get ahead of rivals in areas like electric vehicles.They said they aimed to produce nearly half of their vehicles under the leader-follower approach by 2025 and cut investment for those models by up to 40%.Nissan will take the lead in Japan, China and North America, Renault will be the reference for Europe, Russia, South America and North Africa while Mitsubishi will lead in Southeast Asia and Oceania, the companies said.They did not detail how many jobs would go as production shifts, raising fears that some plants, including Nissan’s Barcelona factory in Spain could shut. [L8N2CW57D]Nissan and Renault are due to announce separate restructuring plans on Thursday and Friday respectively.The alliance’s new production plans will also include using more common parts and designs than before. They will now use a shared design for the upper body of each company’s cars, which would then be personalised to reflect the individual brands.“Today we have a much higher scope of sharing between the brands,�� said Alliance General Secretary Hadi Zablit.	-1.145216578
(Reuters) - Ten of the world’s biggest automakers were sued on Wednesday by U.S. consumers who claim they concealed the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning in more than 5 million vehicles equipped with keyless ignitions, leading to 13 deaths.According to the complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, carbon monoxide is emitted when drivers leave their vehicles running after taking their electronic key fobs with them, under the mistaken belief that the engines will shut off.The 28 named plaintiffs said this can injure or have “deadly�� results for people who inhale the colorless and odorless gas, including when vehicles are left in garages attached to homes. They also said the defect reduces their vehicles�� resale values.A keyless ignition lets a driver start a vehicle by pushing an on-off button, instead of inserting a key, once the vehicle senses the presence of a nearby electronic fob.The defendants include BMW BMWG.DE, including Mini; Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes Benz; Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI; Ford Motor Co F.N; General Motors Co GM.N; and Honda 7267.T, including Acura.Also named as defendants were Hyundai 005380.KS, including Kia; Nissan 7201.T, including Infiniti; Toyota 7203.T, including Lexus; and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, including Bentley.The lawsuit is the latest seeking to hold the automotive industry liable for defects that could make driving unsafe, such as Takata 7312.T airbags and ignition switches on GM vehicles.The lawsuit claimed that the 10 automakers have long known about the risks of keyless ignitions, which have been available in the United States since at least 2003, yet deceived drivers by marketing their vehicles as safe.The plaintiffs said the automakers could have averted the 13 deaths, and many more injuries, by installing an inexpensive feature to automatically turn off unattended engines, and that GM and Ford even took steps to patent a shut-off feature.They said 27 complaints have been lodged with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration since 2009 over keyless ignitions.“The automakers had actual knowledge of the dangerous carbon monoxide poisoning consequences of vehicles with keyless fobs that lack an automatic shut-off,�� the complaint said.Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning kills about 430 people a year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The lawsuit seeks class-action status and an injunction requiring automakers to install automatic shut-off features on all existing and future vehicles sold with keyless ignitions. It also seeks compensatory and punitive damages.Ford said it takes customer safety “very seriously,�� and said its keyless ignition system has proven “safe and reliable.”BMW, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota declined to comment. None of the other automakers had an immediate comment.Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment. A U.S. Department of Transportation spokesman declined to comment on the NHTSA’s behalf.The lawsuit was filed in the same federal court in Los Angeles where Toyota has defended against claims that its vehicles accelerated unintentionally.U.S. District Judge James Selna in July 2013 approved a $1.6 billion settlement to resolve claims that Toyotas lost value because of that defect. The ignition lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte.The case is Draeger et al v. Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 15-06491.	-3.638036297
(Reuters) - Lexus, the premium arm of Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Co 7203.T, this fall is remaking its flagship LS-series sedan - the car that spearheaded the company's audacious assault 23 years ago on BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the upper luxury segment.Now in its fourth generation, the big LS sedan is long overdue for an overhaul. Lexus said late Monday that it plans to unveil the redesigned 2013 LS on July 30 at a special invitation-only event in San Francisco.Lexus released scant details, saying only that the 2013 edition will be offered again in three models - the standard LS 460, the long-wheelbase LS 460 L and the hybrid LS 600h L - as well as a new performance-oriented LS 460 F Sport.The fifth-generation LS, which is being extensively revamped inside and out, will not redefine either the image of the car or the brand - although both could use a makeover.One of the objectives of the redesign is to attract “some new luxury buyers who might not normally think about the LS�� or Lexus when shopping, according to industry consultant James Hall, managing director of 2953 Analytics in Beverly Hills, Michigan.“The original LS was a brand-defining product for Lexus, and it’s still the standard bearer,�� says Hall. “But the target audience in the (luxury) segment is becoming more diffuse. Customer expectations are changing.”In the meantime, the current LS 460 sedan, which received its latest major redesign six years ago, is one of the oldest cars in a relatively exclusive segment populated with such stylish, technology-laden competitors as the Audi A8 NSUG.DE, the BMW 7 Series BMWG.DE and the Porsche Panamera PSHG_p.DE. Prices in this niche typically range from $60,000 to $135,000.With the LS allowed to languish as newer, edgier rivals have driven onto the scene, customers have drifted away from Lexus and its top-of-the-line sedan, whose U.S. sales through the first six months are down 28 percent.“In the luxury space, Lexus often is not even part of the conversation,�� observes Mike Jackson, director of North American vehicle forecasts at IHS Automotive in Northville, Michigan.The irony is that the original LS - unveiled at the 1989 Detroit auto show and put on sale later that year as a 1990 model - was immediately perceived as a significant threat by the premium German brands, especially Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE whose long-running S Class sedan was one of the templates for the LS.Over the next two decades, as Lexus fleshed out its product stable with a ever-wider variety of new models, its U.S. sales volume grew steadily and the brand established an enviable reputation as the industry-wide benchmark for quality and dependability, consistently topping the widely read annual rankings from Consumer Reports and J.D. Power and Associates.Despite a modest facelift for the 2010 model year, and the addition of long-wheelbase, all-wheel-drive and gasoline-electric hybrid variants, however, sales of the LS sedan have continued to dwindle since the fourth generation was introduced in late 2006.Last year’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan also put a serious crimp in total Lexus volume. After 11 consecutive years of leading the luxury sales charts in the U.S., Lexus in 2011 dropped to third place behind BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Despite a partial recovery that has seen sales climb 23 percent in the first six months, Lexus remains mired in the same spot behind the segment leaders.At the same time, the LS has become one of the priciest models, not only in the luxury segment, but also in the brand’s U.S. lineup. The standard 2012 LS 460 starts at $68,505; the top-of-the-line 2012 LS 600h L hybrid is priced from $113,625.Its position of prominence within the Lexus portfolio has long since been supplanted by the RX, a mid-size, middle-of-the-road crossover vehicle in 1998 the created a whole new premium sub-segment, one that has been hugely popular with female buyers.The RX was freshened earlier this year with a crisper front-end design that borrows styling cues from the all-new 2013 Lexus GS sedan. The GS has been lauded for its edgier appearance and sporty driving dynamics, a portion of which is expected to be transferred to the 2013 LS sedan.As was the case with the GS F Sport edition, the new 2013 LS 460 F Sport is expected to receive a bundle of aesthetic and hardware upgrades, ranging from larger wheels and tires to sportier seats and gauges.Jackson says Lexus, with recent designs such the new GS sedan and the 2013 LS, may be starting to shift away from its historically conservative approach to the luxury segment.“Lexus has its core customers,�� he says, but the brand needs to reposition itself and its products to steal buyers away from its premium competitors. Lexus “has to break away from some of its past thinking in order to generate a greater degree of consideration (among luxury buyers). That includes (adopting) not only cutting-edge styling, but also incredible driving dynamics and technology that have become hallmarks of the segment.��	5.338676319
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Apple makes its next move in hands-free smartphone technology for car drivers when it unveils a new, integrated iPhone voice-control system at the Geneva Motor Show this week.The U.S. company’s CarPlay makes its debut in Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo vehicles at the show, demonstrating the software system that allows drivers to control their iPhones via touch and voice, Apple said on Monday.Carmakers have already enabled some access to smartphones via bluetooth technology, but Apple’s latest offering aims to integrate iPhone functionality more seamlessly with dashboard-mounted display and speaker systems.CarPlay enables drivers to access to contacts stored on the iPhone, make calls, return missed calls or listen to voicemails without taking their hands from the steering wheel.Drivers can also use maps, listen to music and access messages “with just a word or a touch��, Apple said. Drivers will also be able to read messages and dictate responses via Apple’s voice-activated Siri software.Apple said that CarPlay will also be available in cars from manufacturers including BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp.	-2.039753494
WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide because of an electronic glitch that can result in air bags not deploying in crashes.The recall, which includes 2.9 million U.S. vehicles, covers 2011-2019 Corolla, 2011-2013 Matrix, 2012-2018 Avalon and 2013-2018 Avalon Hybrid vehicles.The vehicles may have an electronic control unit that does not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can occur in crashes, which could lead to incomplete or non-deployment of the airbags.Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the airbag control module and its wire harness if needed.

* Hyundai global sales up 8 pct last month; Kia up 21 pct* U.S. recovery helps South Korean auto exports* Japanese automakers ride surge in sales at homeSEOUL/TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - Automakers in Japan and South Korea continued to post solid gains in sales in May with Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors benefiting from the sustained recovery of the U.S. market while Japanese domestic sales were supported by government incentives for fuel-efficient models.Auto sales are among the earliest indicators of demand in global economies and U.S. auto sales have proven to be a bright spot while negative headlines from euro zone countries dims the outlook there.Hyundai’s global sales rose 8 percent and Kia’s sales jumped 21 percent in May from a year earlier, driven mainly by overseas sales.Hyundai and Kia have gained market share in the United States, Europe and other key markets since the global financial crisis by offering stylish cars at competitive prices. They have also been helped by the cheaper South Korean currency and South Korea’s free trade deals with Europe and the United States.South Korea’s exports of automobiles, which also include Europe-bound Chevrolet cars made by General Motors�� South Korean unit, rose 4 percent in value terms in May from a year earlier, thanks to the recovery of the U.S. market, according to government data released on Friday. In contrast, overall exports dipped 0.4 percent in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy last month.Shares in Hyundai closed down 2.5 percent and Kia shares dropped 1 percent in a wider market that fell 0.5 percent following disappointing Chinese factory activity data released on Friday.China’s factory activity data fell more than expected in May to its weakest reading this year, highlighting concerns the worsening euro zone debt crisis will further undermine global economic growth.In Japan, car sales soared 66 percent in May to 394,950 vehicles, rebounding from a trough in the months following the earthquake and tsunami a year earlier when carmakers slashed production due to a disruption in the supply chain.Demand for new vehicles has also been supported by the government’s subsidies on fuel-efficient cars, designed to keep domestic factories humming as the strong yen forces automakers to reduce loss-making exports.Excluding 660cc minivehicles - a segment unique to Japan - sales of new cars, trucks and buses also rose by two-thirds, driven by hybrids such as Toyota Motor Corp’s Prius and Honda Motor Co’s gasoline-electric Fit.That marked the biggest rise on record for the month of May, but an official at the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said there was little room for optimism.“The sales volume itself was low and only barely exceeded the tally from two years ago,�� said Michiro Saito, a manager at the dealer association. “We can’t call this a real recovery and the outlook is uncertain.”Non-mini vehicle sales totaled 236,366 in May, compared with 228,514 vehicles two years ago. Toyota’s sales more than doubled, while Honda’s grew 48 percent. Nissan Motor Co , which recovered its supply chain faster last year, posted a 17 percent rise in non-minivehicle sales.Without the help of government tax incentives, the Japanese car market has been trending downwards due to urbanisation, a declining population and the loss of interest in owning cars among young people.The revival of Japanese rivals and limited production capacity of South Korean carmakers threaten to slow the growth of Hyundai and Kia.Industry research firm TrueCar.com expects U.S. light vehicle sales to be up 32 percent in May to the highest level in five years, helped by pent-up demand and as the Japanese automakers bounce back from last year’s earthquake-related vehicle shortages.Hyundai and Kia, which rank fifth in global car sales, and U.S. carmakers General Motors and Ford, lost market share in May in the U.S. market as Toyota and Honda were set to post U.S. market share gains, according to TrueCar.com.“The U.S. market is recovering fast, but Hyundai, Kia are falling short of catching up with market demand, although they are running plants at full capacity,�� Dongbu Securities analyst Yim Eun-young said.	7.4510855

SEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co has raised its stakes in growing Southeast Asian markets with a $250 million investment in Singapore’s Grab, its second in the ride-hailing firm, as it chases rivals in the race for new-age transportation.The investment is Hyundai’s biggest-ever in an auto-tech firm, yet is smaller than those made by others including Toyota Motor Corp. Nevertheless, it underscores a shift in strategy at a South Korean conglomerate that has typically shunned partnerships in favor of developing its own technologies.Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors Corp will launch pilot electric vehicle (EV) projects in Southeast Asia next year, starting with Singapore, where 200 EVs will be leased to Grab drivers, Hyundai said in a statement.It said the project will later be expanded to countries including Malaysia and Vietnam, where markets for traditionally powered cars are dominated by Japanese rivals.The move comes as Hyundai battles sluggish sales in its two biggest markets, China and the United States, while its stock price has fallen nearly a third this year.Hyundai has joined the global race to invest in mobility firms as individual car ownership is widely expected to fall due to in part to increasing car-sharing options in big cities.“Not only Hyundai, but all global auto manufacturers have realized that generating revenue solely from selling vehicles is not a sustainable, viable option,�� Hyundai’s chief innovation officer, Chi Young-cho, told reporters in Seoul.“It is better to disrupt than being disrupted,�� he said.Earlier this year, Hyundai said it invested $25 million for a 0.45 percent stake in Grab, joining investors such as Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp.Grab said it has so far raised $2.7 billion in funding, including Hyundai’s latest investment, and is on track to attract over $3 billion by the end of this year. Grab President Ming Maa told Reuters that the company does not yet have plans to go public.The partnership will help Grab lower car ownership and operating costs for its drivers, Maa said. Lower costs help ride-hailing firms attract and retain drivers.Hyundai expects to launch its own ride-sharing service in select markets next year, said Chi, who oversees Hyundai’s new businesses such as those involving ride-sharing, artificial intelligence and robotics. He also said the automaker is looking at acquisition opportunities, without giving details.The automaker aims to collect data such as on battery charging from cars it leases to Grab to develop vehicles better tailored for Southeast Asia. It also hopes to explore the possibility of building a factory in the region in the longer term.Southeast Asia’s EV market is very small. Only 142 battery-powered cars are likely to be sold in the market this year, versus six last year, showed data from market researcher LMC Automotive.EV sales this year are likely to reach 693,894 units in China and 172,744 units in the United States, LMC data showed.	0.5531807895
(Refiles story to remove extra word “against�� in first paragraph)* Raises FY op view to 2.5 trln yen from 2.3 trln yen* Weak yen offsets impact of cut vehicle sales target* Q2 op profit rises 11 pct, beats analyst estimatesTOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9.1 percent on Wednesday as a sharp decline in the yen increases the value of repatriated earnings and makes up for lower vehicle sales.The world’s biggest automaker now expects operating profit of 2.50 trillion yen ($21.87 billion) for the business year ending March 31, rather than the previously forecast 2.30 trillion yen, thanks partly to a 135 billion yen contribution from foreign exchange gains. It sees sales at 9.05 million vehicles instead of 9.10 million.Toyota also revised its net profit estimate to 2.00 trillion yen from 1.78 trillion yen. Net profit includes earnings made with joint venture partners in China.“Of course exchange rates helped, but we also made efforts to offset negatives such as a rise in fixed costs, with cost-cutting and sales efforts,�� Executive Vice President Nobuyori Kodaira told a news conference.The Japanese currency passed 113 yen to the dollar this week for the first time since December 2007 after Japan’s central bank eased its already-loose monetary policy. Toyota adjusted its dollar rate assumption for the full year to 104 yen from 101 yen, leaving more room for profit growth is the yen stays weak.In July-September, an 8 percent fall in the yen combined with cost-cutting to help Toyota book record second-quarter earnings.Toyota reported an 11.3 percent rise in second-quarter operating profit to 659.22 billion yen, compared with the 650.7 billion yen average estimate of 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net profit rose 23 percent to 539.06 billion yen.The automaker has been enjoying strong sales in the United States, its biggest market, spurred by economic recovery, easy access to financing and lower gasoline prices. It raised its sales forecast for North America slightly, to 2.74 million vehicles from 2.71 million.But uncertainty looms over the market in China, where Japanese peers Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co cut sales outlooks over the past week citing a sluggish economy.Toyota aims to boost China sales by at least a fifth to over 1.1 million vehicles this year. Unlike Honda and Nissan, Toyota and joint venture partners China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd have seen sales gain over the past few months.Shares in Toyota ended up 0.1 percent ahead of the earnings announcement, compared with a 0.4 percent rise in Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei average.

* Mitsubishi buys one cargo, sells some to Mitsui -source* Other buyers include Zen-Noh, Toyota Tsusho and Itochu* Japan has bought 150,000-180,000 T of US sorghum since mid-April (Details Mitsubishi purchase, adds quotes)TOKYO, May 17 (Reuters) - Japanese buyers have bought between 150,000 and 180,000 tonnes of U.S. sorghum carried by three vessels previously bound for China amid a trade spat between Beijing and Washington, five industry sources with knowledge of the deals told Reuters.The cargoes were among roughly two dozen bought by China but left stranded after Beijing announced last month it would hit U.S. imports with a 178.6 percent deposit on the value of sorghum shipments, amid escalating trade tensions.Trading firms have been scrambling to offload the cargoes to other countries, including Spain, which has so far purchased five cargoes, and Saudi Arabia.Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp bought one vessel carrying about 58,000 tonnes of U.S. sorghum, said a source who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. Mitsui &amp; Co purchased some of the sorghum from that vessel, the source said.“The cargo has arrived at Kashima port and also stopped at Mizushima and Shibushi ports to offload some of the supply, with unloading work to be completed this week,�� the source said.Another source said the vessel arrived at Kashima late last month.Other buyers include Zen-Noh, a Japanese farmers�� cooperative, and a pair of trading companies - Toyota Tsusho Corp and Itochu Corp, four sources said.“There may be another vessel coming to Japan if Marubeni Corp succeeds in striking a deal with a partner of another country,�� one of the sources added.Officials from Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Zen-Noh, Toyota Tsusho, Itochu and Marubeni all declined to comment.Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Thomson Reuters Interactive Map shows the cargo that offloaded at Kashima port in late April left Archer Daniel Midland Co’s Galveston elevator around March 7. Another vessel that arrived at Kashima port on May 16 departed Cargill’s Houston elevator at the end of March.While some early offers for the distressed cargoes came in as low as $160-$170 per tonne just after China’s announcement, the Japanese buyers paid more than that but “still much lower than the pre-mid-April levels,�� another source said.Traders said Japanese firms had paid around $230 per tonne for sorghum before Beijing announced the deposit.Japan’s sorghum imports have been declining since 2012 as cheaper alternatives took a greater share of livestock feed. Sorghum’s blending ratio slid to 2.3 percent in the 2016/17 financial year from 7.7 percent in 2012/13, said Commodity Intelligence, a Japanese commodity market research company.In 2017/18, Japan imported about 365,830 tonnes of grain sorghum, down from 1.46 million tonnes in 2012/13, according to government data.Japan’s increased sorghum purchases may mean reduced imports of other commonly used feed grains like corn, barley and wheat or less use of locally-grown feed rice, a source said.In the longer term, a lack of Chinese buyers could put pressure on sorghum prices, increasing its share of the Japanese feed market.“Many believe that this is a one-off thing, but if the U.S. producers sell sorghum at cheaper prices than corn, Japanese feedmakers may buy more sorghum and buy less corn or wheat,�� the source said.	0.3528374008
DETROIT (Reuters) - Consumer Reports on Thursday pulled a recommendation for Tesla Inc’s Model 3, citing reliability problems, and the influential U.S. magazine turned up the pressure on other automakers to include crash-avoiding automatic braking as standard equipment.The magazine’s decision to withdraw its endorsement for the Tesla Model 3 less than nine months after recommending the electric sedan highlighted questions about quality that Tesla has faced since the vehicle’s difficult launch. Tesla shares fell 3.4 percent to $292.19 in afternoon trading Thursday on the Nasdaq.Low scores for the Model 3 hurt the brand’s overall standing, knocking it down 11 spots to No. 19 out of 33 brands in Consumer Reports�� 2019 annual rankings.Millions of prospective auto buyers consult the magazine’s rankings, which are based on road testing, reliability, safety and owner satisfaction scores.Despite reliability problems, Model 3 owners said they love their vehicles, said Jake Fisher, the magazine’s senior director of automotive testing.“We have already made significant improvements to correct any issues that Model 3 customers may have experienced that are referenced in this (Consumer Reports) report,�� a Tesla representative said in an email, “and our return policy allows any customer who is unhappy with their car to return it for a full refund.”Earlier this month, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said during a call with investors that the company is focusing on improving customer service and quality.Consumer Reports�� refusal to endorse cars that lack technology that automatically applies brakes disqualified a wide swath of popular brands and models, including General Motors Co’s Chevrolet.“We’ve been pushing for this feature for a long time because it’s very good at preventing crashes,�� Fisher said in a phone interview. “We have telegraphed for some time that this was coming.”A growing number of new vehicle models now include automatic emergency braking, often called AEB, as standard, including Subaru Corp’s Ascent, Consumer Reports�� 2019 top pick for the midsize SUV category.Subaru was ranked as Consumer Reports�� top car brand, followed by Hyundai Motor Co’s luxury Genesis then Volkswagen AG units Porsche and Audi in third and fourth place, respectively. Toyota’s luxury Lexus brand ranked fifth.GM, which constantly stresses it is aiming for “zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion,�� did not respond to a request for comment.This year’s top picks included several wins for Toyota Motor Corp, including for its full-size Avalon hybrid electric sedan and the Toyota Prius hybrid. Subaru won for its compact Forester SUV and its midsize Ascent SUV.GM’s Chevrolet brand was ranked 23rd, while the Cadillac brand ranked 26th and GMC 27th.Ford Motor Co’s Ford brand ranked 20th and its Lincoln brand 8th, but its best-selling F-150 pickup truck was named best pickup.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Chrysler brand ranked 22nd, with its Dodge brand 25th and Jeep brand in 29th place.The automaker’s Fiat unit finished last among 33 brands rated.	-1.09177475
LOS ANGELES, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp U.S. executive Jim Lentz said consumers purchasing new vehicles to replace those lost during Superstorm Sandy will mean strong November U.S. auto sales.On a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, November U.S. sales will be between 14.8 million and 15.2 million new vehicles, said Lentz, president and chief executive of Toyota Motor Sales, USA.Lentz, speaking on the sidelines of a J.D.

* Nissan may face big risk over Trump Mexico trade policy* Nissan is Mexico’s biggest automaker, exports most to U.S.* Analyst: Nissan would face 10 pct profit hit on 10 pct tariffTOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened Toyota Motor Corp over its Mexican-built cars, but the biggest risk from a punitive tariff would be for its compatriot Nissan Motor Co, the largest automaker operating in the country.Trump has criticised U.S. companies like General Motors and Ford Motor Co which manufacture abroad, accusing them of costing U.S. jobs. On Thursday he took on Toyota, warning the world’s largest automaker that it would face a “big border tax�� if it exported Mexico-built cars to the U.S. market.But it is Nissan, Japan’s second-largest automaker, which would be the bigger victim of any tax punishment. Nissan built its first overseas plant in Mexico in 50 years ago and now produces more than 800,000 cars there, mainly its entry-level Versa and Sentra sedans.Nissan’s production dwarfs that of Toyota, Honda Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp in Mexico. It exports roughly half of its output to the United States, where it also has production plants.Vehicles made in Mexico comprise roughly one-quarter of Nissan’s total U.S. vehicle sales, industry experts say, compared with around 30 percent for smaller rival Mazda, but less than 10 percent for Toyota and Honda.Japanese automakers together produced around 1.4 million vehicles in Mexico in the year ended March, nearly 40 percent of the country’s total output. According to the Japan External Trade Organization, they plan to ramp up production to 1.9 million by 2019.Current production in Mexico is dwarfed by the number of cars they produce in the United States, their single largest market, where Japan’s top three automakers alone produced around 4 million vehicles in 2015.Trump has said he plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, and has vowed to impose a 35 percent tariff on cars exported to the United States from Mexico.According to JP Morgan estimates, an increase in tariffs on cars exported from Mexico to the United States to even 10 percent would hit Nissan’s consolidated operating earnings by 10.3 percent, more than 5.5 percent at Mazda. Toyota would see a hit of 0.7 percent, while Honda 2.2 percent.All four Japanese automakers building cars in Mexico said they have no immediate plans to change operations, and one Asian auto executive told Reuters his company long ago made a strategic decision to make Mexico a production hub in North America, and that it is tough to alter its strategy overnight.“We can’t turn back the clock on these decisions,�� said the executive, who did not have clearance to speak to media and so declined to be identified.“What we need to explain more clearly (to Trump) is that most automakers are not cutting production capacity or jobs in the United States to make Mexico an additional production hub.”Still, analysts said automakers would likely think twice about expanding production in the country in the coming years.“As long as this administration is in place I suspect (Nissan is) not going consider any additional capacity there,�� CLSA analyst Chris Richter said.Trump’s criticisms come just as Japanese automakers are shuffling their production portfolios to boost supply of popular, higher-margin sport utility vehicles (SUV) and trucks for the U.S. market.Honda last year announced it would expand its U.S. production capacity to build more of its CR-V SUV, while shifting production from Mexico.Toyota has said that its Guanajuato plant under construction in Mexico will produce the entry level Corolla sedan, a vehicle segment currently produced at its plants in Mississippi and Ontario, Canada. Demand for the cars has slumped in recent years as cheap gasoline prices has prompted drivers to buy more SUVs.“We’re always considering ways to increase production in the United States, regardless of the political situation,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters on Thursday.

(Adds company, analyst comments)SHANGHAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Sales at Toyota Motor Corp and its Chinese joint ventures rose 23.5 percent in January compared with a year earlier, the first rise since the outbreak of anti-Japan protests last year that led to a sharp drop in sales among Japanese carmakers.Toyota said seasonal factors were behind its first rise in Chinese sales since June, and analysts said it was too early to declare the struggles of Japanese brands over.“The results are higher than a year ago as the Spring Festival fell in January last year,�� the company said in a text message. Many shops, including car dealers, close during the week-long holiday which comes in February this year.Ye Sheng, an analyst at Ipsos, said focus should be on the first-quarter data rather than monthly figures.“Toyota’s year-on-year rise in January sales could have been inflated by several factors: carmakers typically cut prices aggressively before the Lunar New Year, people are more willing to buy new cars at the start of the year, and last year’s New Year was in January,�� he said.Toyota said it and its Chinese partners sold 72,500 cars in the country in January.Toyota’s China sales fell 15.9 percent in December. Last month’s rise was the first year-on-year growth since June last year.Japanese carmakers saw their China sales drop sharply after violent anti-Japan protests erupted across the country in September after Japan nationalised islands in the East China Sea. China also claims the islands as its own territory.Sales in China of Japanese brands including Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, have been recovering slowly since October, but have not yet regained prior levels.Toyota, which operates car ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co , aims to sell 900,000 cars in the country this calendar year, up 7.1 percent from a year earlier.

TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Canon Inc has appointed its first outside directors, ending years of high-profile resistance to opening up its boardroom as pressure mounts on Japan’s big companies to improve governance and better manage risks.The camera maker’s long-serving chief executive Fujio Mitarai, who headed Japan’s powerful Keidanren business lobby from 2006 to 2010, had argued that only insiders could understand the company well enough to serve effectively on its board.Canon’s surprise move follows similar shifts at Japanese bellwethers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Hitachi Ltd as globalisation helps to prise open their decision-making structures to the outside world.Canon said on Wednesday its board would be joined by Kunitaro Saida, a lawyer who has served as chief prosecutor in Osaka, and Haruhiko Kato, a former commissioner of Japan’s National Tax Agency who became one of Toyota’s first independent board members last June.“Mitarai was the most powerful, most outspoken opponent to the concept of outside directors,�� said Nicholas Benes, a corporate governance expert and representative director of The Board Director Training Institute of Japan.“This is a really interesting development which in a way is really good for corporate governance in Japan.”A Canon spokesman said the company had not opposed having independent directors but had been unable to find people with suitable credentials.“We haven’t had any scandals or anything that would increase pressure on us to have an outside director, so we weren’t in a particular hurry to appoint one,�� said Canon public relations officer Jun Misumi.Benes said companies have also come under pressure to appoint outside directors since Institutional Shareholder Services, a leading proxy adviser firm, began opposing the renewal of chief executives�� terms at companies with no independent directors.Toyota appointed three independent directors last June, its first ever, after critics blamed an insular management style for its slow response to fatal accidents in the United States and recalls of millions of vehicles.Hitachi Ltd, Japan’s largest electronics company, reshuffled its board in 2012 to appoint a majority of independent directors for the first time, with three non-Japanese among the newly named outside directors.Canon also reported quarterly results on Wednesday that fell short of both its own guidance and market expectations, as the boost from a weaker yen, increasing the value of its revenue from abroad, was outweighed by a drop in camera sales.

LONDON (Reuters) - Toyota will try again to win Le Mans next year and in 2019 after committing to another season of the world endurance championship.The Japanese car maker had been considering its position after champions Porsche pulled out at the end of the 2017 season, leaving Toyota as the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category.Toyota said in a statement on Tuesday, however, that it was committed to “at least�� the 2018-19 season following publication of the regulations.The ��super season�� will last 14 months and includes two editions of the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race in June 2018 and 2019.“It is highly regrettable that our rival in honing technologies on the roads of Le Mans has left,�� said Toyota president Akio Toyoda.“Yet the World Endurance Championship... and particularly Le Mans, where the battle goes on for 24 hours, including on public roads, still represent the optimal proving ground for achieving the goal of making cars fun for the next 100 years.”The decision is a boost for double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso, who tested with Toyota in Bahrain last month and is eager to race at Le Mans in his bid to become only the second driver to win the ‘Triple Crown�� of motorsport.The McLaren driver entered the Indianapolis 500 this year, leading that race before retiring when his car’s Honda engine expired.McLaren have ended their Formula One partnership with Honda, opening the door for Alonso to drive for Toyota at Le Mans -- a race that does not clash with any grand prix.Toyota said it will announce the world endurance driver line-up early next year.Only one Japanese manufacturer has ever won Le Mans, Mazda in 1991. Toyota have been five times runners-up and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years in pursuit of victory at the French endurance classic.	9.574551438
(Repeats to add PIX for media clients)TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp looked set to retain its title as the world’s top-selling carmaker in the first half of this year, company figures showed on Friday, outpacing General Motors and Volkswagen as it boosted overseas sales to a record high.The Japanese automaker said its groupwide global sales for the first six months totalled 4.911 million vehicles. That was down 1.1 percent from a year earlier due to weaker Japan sales following the end of green car subsidies, but sales in the United States, its biggest market, were strong.By comparison, General Motors Co’s January-June sales rose 4 percent to more than 4.85 million cars and light trucks, while Volkswagen AG’s climbed 5.5 percent to 4.7 million vehicles, those companies reported earlier this month.Volkswagen’s sales figure, however, excludes its Scania and MAN brands. Scania sold 37,980 vehicles during the same period, while the MAN figure will be released later this month. In recent years, MAN has sold around 60,000 to 70,000 vehicles in the first half of the year.Toyota regained the global sales crown last year after slipping to third place behind GM and Volkswagen in 2011, when its supply chain was hit by naturals disasters in Japan and Thailand and after a series of recalls tarnished its reputation for quality. Previously, it had been on top from 2008 through 2010.Toyota’s groupwide total includes sales at Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd and Hino Motors Ltd.Toyota, based in central Japan, last year made about 40 percent of its vehicles in Japan and exported nearly 60 percent of that. It has benefited from a weaker yen that allows it to export cars more profitably.Toyota, which is scheduled to announce quarterly results on Aug. 2, is expected to post an 84 percent year-on-year rise in operating profit to 649 billion yen ($6.5 billion) and an operating profit margin of 10.8 percent, according to analyst forecasts. The results would likely outpace those of No. 2 Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co and third-ranked Honda Motor Co.

July 19 (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Toyota is close to an agreement to purchase light commercial vans from PSA Peugeot Citroen’s threatened Sevelnord plant in northern France, La Tribune reported.Under the tentative agreement, Toyota would buy between 5,000 and 10,000 vans annually from 2013, rebadged with its own brand, the French weekly said on its website, citing unnamed sources.Peugeot declined to comment on the report.The company last week announced 8,000 job cuts and the closure of another French plant but said it was hopeful that Sevelnord, a joint venture with Fiat, would survive the Italian automaker’s planned withdrawal.Sevelnord’s future depends on finding a new partner and obtaining concessions from unions, among other conditions, manufacturing chief Denis Martin said on July 12.While still in office, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in April that Peugeot and Toyota were in talks to share production at the Sevelnord site after Fiat’s exit.

Polesitter Elliott wins Martinsville Truck raceBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeMARTINSVILLE, Va. -- Polesitter Chase Elliott held off defending NASCAR Camping World Truck Series champion Johnny Sauter after a restart with 12 laps left and pulled away to win Saturday’s Alpha Energy Solutions 250 at Martinsville Speedway by 1.865 seconds.Elliott grabbed the lead from third-place finisher Christopher Bell on Lap 234, when Bell’s Toyota tangled with Austin Cindric’s Ford through Turns 1 and 2. Bell lost the top spot, and Sauter charged past into the second position before NASCAR threw the 10th and final caution of the race.The decisive move, however, came after the final restart on Lap 239, when Elliott blocked Sauter’s crossover move in Turn 3 and kept the lead.“It was fun today,�� Elliott said. “I had some help there with Christopher’s misfortune. I was trying all I could to get by him. He was doing a really good job of maintaining my bumper, a good job with me hitting him. ... His bumper was getting progressively more blue (the color of Elliott’s car) as the day went.“It was a hard-fought battle, for sure.”And then came the battle with Sauter, who said he would have made the same blocking move on the final restart, had the roles been reversed.“Chase did what he needed to do with the old block,�� Sauter said.“I saw him coming in the mirror with a big run, and I knew I had to block him,�� Elliott said. “Fortunately, it worked out.”Bell led a race-high 96 laps, 90 in the final 110-lap stage. Before that, GMS Racing teammates Elliott and Sauter dominated the action. Elliott, a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series regular getting extra track time in preparation for Sunday’s STP 500, won the first stage.Sauter took the second stage but had to come through the field from 13th following the restart for the third stage after pitting for tires in a contrarian strategy to that of Elliott, who got fresh rubber before the end of Stage 2.Elliott (92 laps), Sauter (62 laps) and Bell were the only drivers to lead the 250-lap event at the .526-mile track, but the action behind them was ferocious, producing 10 cautions for 63 laps.Sunoco Rookie of the Year contender Noah Gragson recovered from a spin off Chase Briscoe’s bumper to finish fourth, one spot behind his Kyle Busch Motorsports teammate. Ty Dillon and Brett Moffitt ran fifth and sixth, respectively.NOTE: Sauter took over the series lead by four points over Bell, who won the previous NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Atlanta. ... Elliott and Sauter reversed their positions from the fall race at Martinsville, which Sauter won on the way to his first championship.NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Race -- Alpha Energy Solutions 250Martinsville SpeedwayMartinsville, VirginiaSaturday, April 1, 20171.

TOKYO, April 14 (Reuters) - Japan looks set to miss its ambitious target of having around 100 hydrogen fuelling stations for fuel-cell cars in operation by March 2016, with just 76 approved after the deadline to apply for subsidies passed last month.The government had earmarked 21.38 billion yen ($178.37 million) over the past three years to subsidise the construction and operation of fuelling stations by March 2016 as it aims to lead the world in setting up a hydrogen-based society featuring fuel-cell cars such as Toyota Motor Corp’s Mirai.But applications for the final portion - a supplementary budget of 9.59 billion yen for fiscal 2015 - resulted in just 32 stations getting the nod, government data showed this week, highlighting the difficulty of encouraging energy companies to bet on the still-unproven business.A total of 44 had been approved previously.So far, the only commercial fuel-cell car on the road is the Mirai, launched in December. Toyota has said it would limit production to three a day for the first year, ramping that up to about 3,000 in 2017. Honda Motor Co is also due to begin selling a fuel-cell car by next March but has not disclosed a sales target.Hydrogen stations cost about $5 million to build, and the government’s subsidy for one location is capped at around half that. Even with the generous handouts, the stations are seen making a loss for at least the first decade, industry officials say.When contacted by Reuters, an official of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said the government will consider whether to increase the subsidy to prod companies to set up the stations.To take the plunge, energy companies want proof that fuel-cell cars will take off, while a dearth of fuelling stations is a put-off for consumers, resulting in a classic chicken-and-egg conundrum. Fuel-cell cars, which run on hydrogen and emit only water, are also expensive, requiring big subsidies themselves. The Mirai’s suggested retail price is 7.24 million yen ($60,404).The hurdles of setting up the necessary infrastructure are often cited by fuel-cell sceptics such as Nissan Motor Co Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn as a big reason that battery-run electric cars are a better zero-emission option.

SYDNEY, March 10 (Reuters) - The Australian government on Tuesday partially reversed planned funding cuts to the automotive industry, allowing the sector to keep A$500 million ($383 million) as major manufacturers prepare to shut down operations.Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s government had planned to cut almost A$1 billion in funding following announcements from Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and the Holden unit of General Motors Co last year that they would wind up car manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017.However, a hostile upper house refused to pass the cuts, fearing that the car makers would bring forward their closure. State politicians also lobbied to keep the funding ahead of elections.“We don’t want anything to jeopardise the survival of the industry until Holden finally closes,�� Federal Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane told reporters on Tuesday.The restored funding will be split 55 percent to the auto manufacturers and 45 percent to component makers.Car companies have blamed the previously high Australian dollar, high costs of manufacturing and low economies of scale for their decision to exit the country.Government figures show that car makers have not made a profit since 2003, instead running up combined losses of A$4.4 billion.The closures will be a blow to an already sluggish labour market given about 45,000 people are employed in vehicle and parts manufacturing, with Toyota, Holden and Ford accounting for around 8,000 directly, according to official figures.	4.652554417
TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is considering moving some production of its Lexus luxury brand to the United States because of the strength of the Japanese yen, the automaker's head of U.S. sales said on Wednesday.A likely candidate would be shifting production of the Lexus ES sedan from Japan to the United States, the executive, Jim Lentz, said. Because of the high cost of such a move, Toyota would have to monitor the market and the yen’s strength further before making any decision, he added.“With where the yen is today, I think it’s only a matter of time�� before Toyota moves more production to North America, particularly to the United States, to have assembly nearer to the U.S. market, he said.Lentz said that in addition to the strong yen, moving production was “being driven�� by engineering capabilities in the United States, including at Toyota’s engineering center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where more than 1,100 engineers are employed.Japan on Tuesday said it would extend its dollar credit facility, aimed at helping companies invest overseas, by six months as part of its efforts to cope with the strong yen.Lentz, speaking to reporters at an industry conference in Traverse City, Michigan, said Toyota would stand by its forecast for industrywide U.S. sales of 14.3 million vehicles in 2012.Currently, about 70 percent of the vehicles Toyota sells in North America are made there. Lentz said that is a good level, but several factors are leading Toyota to consider raising it.He said that while Mexico is an option for more production, sending production to the United States is more likely.“We look at North American in toto, but we do very little manufacturing in Mexico. We have one plant,�� Lentz said.He said U.S. industry auto sales gained strength in the last quarter of 2011 and early 2012 but then stalled, largely because of a lack of consumer confidence about taking out car loans.Lentz said sales will not improve significantly until after the November presidential election. Once the election is over, retail sales will increase, regardless of which candidate wins, because there will be more certainty on the course the federal government takes on the economy.While the European financial crisis may have an impact on U.S. consumers psychologically, Lentz said problems in Europe would not hit U.S. auto sales significantly.Toyota’s incentives for auto buyers are among the lowest in the industry, but the company is considering adding incentives in the luxury market, he said.Lentz said he expects the recent surge in subprime lending, which offers consumers with lower credit scores the chance to get a car loan, to continue into the new future.“The biggest change in lending today is more and more banks are getting involved. That’s a big change,�� he said.Across the auto industry, banks are become more active in making car loans, which “means banks have a lot of money to lend and don’t want to be in the housing market,�� he said. “There is profit to be made on the car side.”�It’s not nearly what it was when the Great Recession hit,�� he said.In addition to easier credit, Lentz said new vehicle sales will rise in the next few years because the average age of the 240 million or so cars on U.S. roads is nearly 11 years. He said another factor was slower production from 2008 to 2010, which means a low inventory of vehicles less than five years old; such vehicles compete with new vehicles for consumers�� attention.Toyota announced more than a year ago that it would have a fuel cell vehicle for the U.S. market in 2015.On Wednesday, Lentz revealed that the company’s first consumer fuel cell vehicle will be a sedan. He did not say how big the sedan would be or whether it would be a lease-only car.Lentz said he has been driving a fuel cell Highlander SUV that was produced as a test vehicle, and has been getting 300 to 320 miles per refueling of hydrogen. It takes four to five minutes to refuel the vehicle, he said.“The big question with regard to fuel cells is going to be infrastructure,�� said Lentz. He would not say how many fuel cell vehicles will be available in 2015.He said Toyota has not decided if it will roll out the fuel cell sedan in limited markets in the United States.	0.1593918588
TOKYO (Reuters) - The revelation that Japan's third-biggest steelmaker Kobe Steel Ltd 5406.T fabricated data for some of its aluminium and copper products has left affected manufacturers scrambling to pin down the potential impact. The products were shipped to around 200 companies which include some of Japan’s most recognizable names:Automakers affected by Kobe Steel's announcement include Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T Subaru Corp 7270.T and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T, the respective companies confirmed.Japan’s largest automaker Toyota said the compliance breach was a “grave issue��, adding that Kobe Steel’s products were used in vehicle doors and hoods.Doors and hoods were also affected at Nissan, a spokesman said.The automaker is grappling with its own compliance failures, recalling all new cars sold in Japan in the last three years after discovering final vehicle inspections were not performed by authorized technicians.Honda said doors and hoods were affected, while Subaru said vehicles and aircraft were affected.Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Subaru.Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including the H-2A rocket launched on Tuesday to put a navigation satellite into orbit. The rocket cleared all safety checks before launch, the company said.Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Mitsubishi Heavy.Heavy machinery maker IHI Corp 7013.T said affected products were used in its jet engines. IHI is a supplier for engines used on Boeing Co BA.N aircraft and in Japan's defense and aerospace industries. The company did not say which engines used the affected products. Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by IHI.Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd 7012.T said affected materials were used in airplane parts and airplane engine parts while it was still investigating to see if there were any other products including trains that used affected materials. Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy.Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai) 9022.T, which operates the Shinkansen bullet train line between Tokyo and Osaka, said Kobe Steel's products were used in some of its Shinkansen's train trucks - the undercarriage of the train. The products were tested for safety before they were used, a spokesman said. 	1.112185687
BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China’s state-owned automaker FAW Group said it signed a deal with 16 banks for a credit line worth over 1 trillion yuan ($144 billion), but did not give specific reasons as to why it wanted to secure access to such a large amount of funding.FAW said in a posting on its social media account it wanted to consolidate its cooperation with banks, create an open and innovative financial platform and to secure funds for FAW initiatives in the future.The credit line is part of a government plan to revitalise the economies of China’s northeastern provinces, a FAW source said, declining to be identified as the source was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.China’s National Development and Reform Commission announced a plan in January to boost the rustbelt northeast, the latest in a long line of efforts to help the area, but the announcement did not mention FAW at the time.Shares in two FAW units, FAW Car Co Ltd and Tianjin FAW Xiali Automobile Co Ltd, jumped by their daily limit of 10 percent after the news of the credit line.FAW has a joint venture with Volkswagen which produces VW and Audi cars, and one with Toyota, which builds the Crown and Corolla models.The 16 banks in the agreement with FAW include China Development Bank, China Construction Bank, Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.China’s economy in the third quarter slowed to its weakest quarterly pace since the global financial crisis, data last week showed, hurt by the weakest factory output since February 2016 as carmakers slashed production due to a sales slowdown.The figures came as regulators move quickly to calm nervous investors as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States began to bite.

TOKYO (Reuters) - When Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T President Akio Toyoda visited northern Japan in July last year and announced a $24 million engine plant expansion, some analysts saw it as evidence of a flawed strategy that put patriotism above profitability.At the time, Toyota was struggling to rebuild its supply base after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the yen was climbing toward a post-war record high against the dollar.But the Miyagi Taiwa plant began assembling engines for the small hybrid Aqua, exported as the Prius C, this month with a welcome wind at Toyota’s back: a weakening yen and a government-in-waiting determined to drive it lower.Analysts say a continued slide in the Japanese currency could tip the competitive balance on pricing back in favor of Toyota and away from its toughest and fastest-rising global competitor, Hyundai Motor 005380.KS - a new dynamic that would likely be repeated across other Japanese export industries.Since early October, the yen has weakened about 8 percent against the dollar and 10 percent against the Korean won. Over the same period, shares in Toyota have jumped by 30 percent as investors reacted to the prospect of higher profitability on cars built in Japan for export, including Lexus luxury models.“As the yen weakens, that very tight cost structure they have put in place to maximize profitability in an appreciated yen position allows them now to make a lot more profit,�� said Larry Dominique, an analyst at TrueCar.com and former Nissan executive.“With the Korean currency appreciating, I would expect that what you would see (for Hyundai) is some of the same issues that the Japanese faced over the past several years.”Whether the strategy of driving down the yen works to slow the “hollowing out�� of Japanese manufacturing will be key for Japan’s new government under Liberal Democratic Party chief Shinzo Abe, who is pushing for super-easy monetary policy to weaken the yen and lift pressure on exporters like Toyota.The yen’s rise in recent years has hurt Japan’s exporters across the board, including industries like electronics and shipbuilding where competition with Korean rivals is also fierce. The number of Japanese factory workers fell 13 percent to about 10.4 million between 2002 and 2011.But Toyota has been the slowest to abandon production in Japan - a conservative position that would make it the biggest beneficiary if the yen were to drop sharply now.For his part, Toyoda has showed no signs of budging from a vow to make at least 3 million vehicles a year in Japan. Toyota engineers say the strategy allows them to keep suppliers close and drive innovations at “mother plants�� in Japan which can provide guidance on cost-cutting for overseas plants.By contrast, Nissan under Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn has been aggressively moving production offshore.Under Ghosn, Nissan shifted production of its “March�� subcompact - one of its top-sellers in Japan - to Thailand from Japan and has scrambled to buy more parts made overseas, including South Korea. Just 20 percent of Nissan’s global production now originates in Japan, down from 50 percent five years ago. For Honda, Japan accounts for 26 percent of its total production, down from 34 percent in 2007.For Toyota, the comparable figure is 40 percent, down from 50 percent in 2007.As a result, Toyota is much more sensitive to the yen exchange rate than its Japanese rivals. Toyota operating profits fall by 35 billion yen for every one-yen drop in the value of the dollar. For Nissan, that comparable figure is 20 billion yen and for Honda 16 billion yen, the companies have said. Gains of the same proportion could be expected from a weakening yen.“Toyota is the one that is hit the hardest when the yen is high,�� said Koji Endo, an autos analyst at Advanced Research in Tokyo. “But it is also the one that benefits the most when the yen is low.”�HOW DID HE DO THAT?’Analysts point to Hyundai’s recent success as an example of how a smart manufacturer can use the pricing power of a weak currency to undercut rivals.A video that went viral at the Frankfurt auto show in 2011 caught Volkswagen Chairman Martin Winterkorn in candid admiration at Hyundai’s quality gains. The video, which was widely circulated among auto executives, shows Winterkorn admiring the interior of a Hyundai i30.Speaking to an entourage, Winterkorn notes that the windshield wipers are hidden from view - as they would be on a more expensive car - and that the steering wheel makes no sound when adjusted. “How did he do that?�� Winterkorn asks about Hyundai. Off camera, a VW engineer can be heard to chime in: “We had a solution but it was too expensive.”Similarly, Hyundai has used a weaker won to help target Toyota’s luxury Lexus brand. That is similar to what Lexus did to Mercedes and BMW in 1990 when it went from nowhere to become the top-selling U.S. luxury brand. At the time of the Lexus launch, the dollar was trading near 130 yen.But in recent years, Hyundai has become the value leader. The top-of-the-line Hyundai Equus starts at $67,150 for 2013, an increase of just 1 percent over the previous year.The sedan built at Hyundai’s Ulsan plant also comes packed with features like 19-inch chrome wheels and a massage unit for the VIP seat in the rear as well as for the driver. Hyundai also promises that anyone who buys an Equus will never have to visit a dealer for service. Staff pick up the car at a home or business and replace it on the spot with a loaner.By contrast, the strong yen forced Toyota to hike the price of the competing Japan-built Lexus LS 460L by 8 percent on the all-wheel-drive model for 2013 to $82,670.Toyota could take advantage of a weaker yen now to address those pricing gaps and to add features where it has skimped. The Prius C built in Iwate in northern Japan, for example, was designed to be priced about $4,000 below a full-size Prius in the United States, Toyota’s largest and most profitable market.But Consumer Reports panned the hybrid for what it called a cheap-looking plastic interior and bad road noise.A stronger won now could force tougher choices on Hyundai and its affiliate, Kia Motors 000270.KS, analysts and executives say. In recent years, Hyundai Motor's operating margin averaged 8.1 percent when the won weakened against the yen compared with a leaner 6.5 percent when it was strengthening, according to Thomson Reuters calculations.A study by researchers at the Korea Automotive Research Institute released this month found South Korean auto exports shrink by 1.2 percent annually with every 1 percent decline in the value of the yen against the won.“We are agonizing over the firming won,�� said one Kia executive, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about strategy.But for the currency changes to have deep and lasting effects, they would need to be sustained, analysts and executives said. Automakers need four to five years to design a new model and shift suppliers. And in the end, every automaker has the same goal - to neutralize the impact of exchange rates by building more vehicles in the markets where they sell.At the same time, a weaker yen remains more speculative than real, industry executives caution.“It is wrong to say the yen is weak,�� Toyoda said last week. “The yen is still super strong at the current level.��	2.420574887

BELMONT, Calif., July 29 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG , the world’s No. 1 automaker, will offer automatic braking and other crash avoidance systems as standard or optional features on most 2016 models sold in the United States beginning later this year, the company said on Wednesday.Volkswagen said it will offer systems that can bring a car to a full stop from about 18 miles (29 km) per hour when the vehicle’s sensors detect an imminent crash. At higher speeds, the automatic braking system will slow the vehicle but may not bring it to a full stop, VW senior engineer Michael Rohlfs said in a presentation to journalists.VW will offer other automated features to help drivers stay in a lane and automatically maintain a safe distance behind another vehicle in traffic. Several VW brand models will also get new technology to automate the process of steering into a parallel parking space or backing into a perpendicular parking space.VW overtook Toyota Motor Corp as the world’s largest carmaker by sales in the first half year, achieving its long-held ambition three years ahead of target. But staying on top will be a challenge and it is driving to boost U.S. sales.Volkswagen announced its plans to push new collision avoidance technology, along with upgraded infotainment systems, at its Silicon Valley research laboratory.The push to add advanced safety features and infotainment features such as Apple Inc’s Apple CarPlay and Google Inc’s Android Auto smartphone integration systems, or apps to connect the car systems to smart watches, are part of the brand’s effort to guarantee a spot on shopping lists.U.S. and European regulators are pushing automakers to make automatic braking that can prevent or mitigate collisions more widely available. Toyota earlier this year said it would offer automatic braking on a wider range of U.S. models at prices ranging from about $300 to $500.VW said automated safety features would be standard on higher-priced versions of models such as the CC, Golf, Jetta and Touareg sport utilities, as well as a redesigned Passat sedan expected later this year. On entry level models, adding the advanced safety features could cost up to $1,500, a VW spokesman said.	-10.50124745
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has lost its bid to overturn an $11.4 million verdict handed down in February by a jury in Minnesota federal court that found an accelerator defect in its 1996 Camry was at fault in a fatal car crash.On Monday, U.S. District Judge Ann Montgomery in Minnesota denied Toyota’s motion for a new trial, finding that the verdict was supported by evidence presented during the three-week trial earlier this year. She also found some plaintiffs were entitled to recoup pre- or post-judgment interest, bringing the total damages to $14 million.To read the full story on WestlawNext Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/1Fle5cf	0.3633128198
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Colorado and major automakers said on Monday they have reached a deal on the state’s plan to adopt California’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) requirements after earlier talks had ended without a deal.The state, which plans to join the California program starting in the 2023 model year, has agreed to allow automakers to earn credits for selling electric vehicles in the two model years prior and use other transitional credits available in other states.Two major auto trade groups representing 99% of U.S. car and truck sales including General Motors Co GM.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, said the state agreed to address concerns ""by providing the support Coloradans need to buy electric vehicles while allowing auto manufacturers to transition into Colorado’s ZEV program.""California has led the way in challenging the Trump administration’s plans to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations. Last week, California struck a deal with four major automakers to tighten emissions rules, bypassing the Trump administration’s effort to strip the state of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards.The Colorado agreement must be approved by the state’s Air Quality Control Commission at a meeting later this month.“This agreement will ensure that Coloradans have access to the range of clean car choices that are increasingly available to consumers in other states,�� said Colorado Transportation Department Executive Director Shoshana Lew.The automakers said Colorado committed to support “the increased adoption and sale of ZEVs, including the state’s commitment to increase the number of ZEVs in its fleet of vehicles.”In June, Colorado said talks with major automakers had failed to reach a deal on voluntary efforts to boost electric vehicle sales. The automakers explored a deal after meeting with Colorado Governor Jared Polis in April.Polis in January signed an executive order directing the state to adopt California’s ZEV rules, joining nine other U.S. states: Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.The California ZEV mandate, first adopted in 1990 and revised on numerous occasions, requires the sale of an increasing number of electric vehicles or other zero-emission vehicles.Last year, California forecast that about 8% of the state’s new vehicle sales in 2025 will be zero-emission and plug-in electric hybrids.In August, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026 and barring California from imposing its own vehicle emission rules or setting requirements for zero emission vehicle sales. The administration is expected to finalize that regulation this fall.California and 18 other states, including Colorado, have said they will fight the Trump administration’s freeze in court, a legal battle that could leave automakers in regulatory limbo for years."	-0.4804392588
* Cuts FY profit fcast by 20 pct to 375 bln yen* Exec hopes China output back to normal in Feb* Q2 profit jumps to 82.2 bln yen, below mkt fcast* Exec: no changes to China investment plans* Honda shares close down 4.7 pctBy Yoko KubotaTOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth after sales in China were hit by a popular backlash against Japanese goods, and warned it could be February before business in the world’s biggest autos market returns to normal.The cut, prompted by a slump in sales amid often violent protests in a dispute about ownership of islands in the East China Sea, makes it likely that bigger Japanese rival Nissan Motor, and possibly Toyota Motor, will follow suit when they report quarterly earnings early next week.“It’s likely Toyota and Nissan are going to cut forecasts in the same way. A cut was to be expected because the problems with China weren’t factored into forecasts,�� said Fujio Ando, managing director at Chibagin Asset Management.Demand for Honda, Toyota and Nissan cars slumped in China in September as tempers flared in the territorial dispute, with South Korea’s Hyundai Motor and Germany’s BMW picking up market share. Toyota has said its China sales dropped 49 percent in September.Sales by Honda and its China joint ventures dropped 40.5 percent last month. China is Honda’s second-biggest market after the United States, accounting for 17 percent of 2011 sales.Honda said on Monday that its two biggest China plants would continue to run on one shift, rather than two, until at least the middle of next month, with output then gradually picking up ahead of Chinese New Year in February - a traditional buying season. It cut its full-year China sales forecast by 17 percent to 620,000 vehicles, but said there would be no change to its investment there. Honda plans to invest $880 million to expand capacity at its plants in Guangzhou and Wuhan over the next few years.“China is the world’s biggest auto market and there’s no doubt it will continue to grow. We will continue our current (investment) plan,�� Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura told a results briefing.Honda, whose models include the Accord, Fit/Jazz, Civic and CR-V, cut its net profit forecast for the year to March to 375 billion yen ($4.7 billion) from 470 billion yen. Last year, Honda reported net profit of 211.5 billion yen. It also cut its forecasts for annual operating profit and revenue, citing uncertain markets in China, Europe and India.Shares in Honda - which fell 15 percent to near 9-month lows amid the China protests - ended 4.7 percent lower at 2,399 yen, their biggest one-day fall in nearly 5 weeks.Honda released its quarterly earnings three hours earlier than planned, after accidentally posting the results on its website. It took down the numbers, but was told by the Tokyo Stock Exchange to bring forward the full announcement, a Honda spokeswoman said.Net profit for July-September rose 36.1 percent to 82.2 billion yen ($1.03 billion), some way below the average estimate of 107.2 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year ago, Japanese manufacturers were still reeling from the March earthquake and tsunami.Honda’s quarterly profits were also dented by start-up and advertising costs for the new Accord sedan, which went on sale in the United States in September, but the refresh helped Japan’s third-biggest automaker increase its share of the U.S. car and light truck market to 8.7 percent in September.The fallout from the Japan-China dispute could run into the current and fourth quarters, analysts have warned. Takaki Nakanishi, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said the impact could, at best, last 3 months, and up to 6 months in a pessimistic scenario.CEO Takanobu Ito, 59, an engineer who took charge three years ago, has set a demanding goal to nearly double global car sales to 6 million in four years. Worldwide production jumped 69 percent in April-September to above 2 million vehicles.The carmaker on Monday trimmed its full-year global sales forecast to 4.12 million vehicles from an earlier estimate of 4.3 million. It said vehicle sales in July-September rose 47 percent to 996,000.Toyota and Nissan report their quarterly earnings on Nov. 5 and Nov. 6, respectively.Last week, Hyundai increased its quarterly net profit by 13 percent to $2 billion, but several European automakers felt the squeeze of the region’s debt crisis, with Peugeot accepting state aid and even leader Volkswagen reporting lower profits.	9.861882019
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday said it would not take up a Toyota dealership’s claim that California’s strict test for determining when employee arbitration agreements are valid interferes with the enforcement of the pacts as required by federal law.The justices denied One Toyota of Oakland LLC’s (OTO) petition for review of a 2019 California Supreme Court ruling that said an arbitration agreement signed by a mechanic who sued the company for unpaid wages was a “paragon of prolixity�� and was invalid because it included dense legal language in tiny print.To read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/30mJaC8	-5.176506624
SYDNEY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Sales of new motor vehicles in Australia surged by the most in 14 months in September to reach an all-time high, a sign consumers have the confidence to splash out on big ticket items even while being cost-conscious on retail spending.Government figures out on Monday showed new vehicle sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 4.7 percent in September to 98,701, following an upwardly revised 4.3 percent rise in August. Sales were up a hefty 14.4 percent compared to September last year.Sales of sports utility vehicles extended their meteoric run with an increase of 4.2 percent to a record peak of 27,818. Sales of passenger vehicles jumped 6.5 percent, while sales of other vehicles, including trucks, increased by 1.1 percent.The robust vehicle numbers contrast with sluggishness seen in retail sales and suggest overall household spending is not as weak as some fear.Industry data out earlier in the month showed new vehicle sales up 9 percent on September last year. Toyota retained first place on the sales ladder with 18.3 percent of the market in September.Mazda jumped to second spot, pipping the Holden unit of General Motors.

June 18 (Reuters) - Defending champions Porsche led after four hours of the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race at the Sarthe Circuit on Saturday with Australian Mark Webber at the wheel of their number one 919 hybrid car.The number six Toyota, driven by Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi, was in second place some 17 seconds behind with the number two Porsche third but with the positions changing as pitstops unfolded.The number seven Audi had fallen back, however, after suffering turbo problems during the second hour of the 84th edition of the race.The start at the track in western France was flagged away by Hollywood actor Brad Pitt.Porsche and stablemates Audi have each entered only two cars instead of three in the main LMP1 category for cost-cutting reasons in the wake of parent company Volkswagen’s diesel emissions scandal.Last year’s race was won by Germany’s Nico Hulkenberg, New Zealander Earl Bamber and Britain’s Nick Tandy but none are driving in the main LMP1 category.Hulkenberg is competing in Sunday’s European Formula One Grand Prix in Baku for Force India.Porsche, who returned to Le Mans with a works team in 2014 for the first time in 16 years, are the most successful manufacturer with 17 titles.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it will recall about 20,000 vehicles worldwide for possible fuel leaks.Most of the affected vehicles are in the United States but were also shipped to other countries, Toyota said.Toyota Motor Sales USA said the recall involves vehicles with its 2GR-FE engine.The recall includes the 2015 model year Lexus RX, and four 2014 model year Toyota vehicles: Avalon, Camry, Highlander and Sienna. Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand.A fuel delivery pipe in the engine may leak because it was not correctly welded by a Toyota supplier company, the automaker said. This could lead to a leak, which could increase the risk of fire.Toyota said it was not aware of any fires, crashes, injuries or fatalities caused by the problem.All of the affected Toyota models were produced in the United States, with the Lexus model made in Canada. They were shipped around the world, including to South Korea, Russia, Australia, other parts of Asia and the Middle East, a Toyota spokesman said.Technicians at Toyota and Lexus dealers will inspect the fuel delivery pipe and if it was produced at that particular supplier, they will replace it with a new one, Toyota said.	-4.589087235
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s steel and engineering employers group said on Tuesday it had withdrawn a “final�� wage offer made to the striking NUMSA union to end a two-week industrial action.The strike by 220,000 NUMSA members has affected production at car makers such as Ford, Toyota and General Motors because of supply chain problems related to the stoppage.“The final offer made last week �� which was intended to end the strike and to see employees back at work this week �� failed to accomplish its goal and has since been withdrawn,�� Kaizer Nyatsumba, chief executive of the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa, said in a statement.NUMSA is seeking 12-15 percent annual increases.

(Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Thursday it will start selling its new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle in California by year’s end.Honda is the latest automaker to bring a small number of hydrogen powered vehicles to market amid increasing zero emission vehicle mandates from California and other U.S. states.The Japanese automaker made the announcement at the Washington auto show, saying the next-generation Honda Clarity Fuel Cell model will cost around $60,000 with a targeted monthly lease under $500. Honda declined to say how many it planned to sell.The vehicle will go on sale in Japan in a few months and in the United States by end of the year. It will initially only be leased.The vehicle’s platform, or basic underpinings, will also be used for a new plug-in hybrid electric car due by 2018. Honda said it expects by 2020 that 20 percent of its U.S. vehicle sales will be hybrids. It will sell its 2017 Accord hybrid later this year.One big issue for fuel cell vehicles is that there are only a handful of hydrogen refueling stations.Sales will begin at some dealerships in Los Angeles and Orange counties, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area. Honda did not offer details about planned sales elsewhere in the United States.Toyota Motor Corp began offering hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in October in California. Hyundai Motor Co has also leased fuel cell vehicles to about 100 U.S. customers. Both offer leases of fuel cell vehicles for $499 a month.Toyota has plans to sell 30,000 fuel cell vehicles globally by 2020, ramping up from an expected 2,000 in 2016. Fuel cell vehicles are a major component of the company’s plans to curb polluting emissions to nearly zero by 2050.	-7.986200949
DETROIT, June 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co is betting that its redesigned ES 350 sedan will buoy sales of its Lexus brand, which lost its place last year as the top-selling luxury nameplate in the United States.The 2013 Lexus ES 350 and its hybrid version, the 300h, will go on sale in mid-August. Lexus expects sales of both models will reach about 5,000 a month, Tim Morrison, vice president for sales and dealer development said in Dearborn on Wednesday.As a brand, Lexus is aiming to sell 250,000 vehicles in the United States this year, up 25 percent from 200,000 last year. The ES 350 is Lexus�� top-selling car.Lexus saw its 11-year streak as the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. market end last year, due in part to vehicle shortages after the Japanese earthquake last year. But analysts say the Lexus lineup also suffered because it lost some of its luster.Lexus is hoping to draw younger buyers with its new sportier design, including a “spindle�� grill that narrows in the middle, that the company has described as “the new face of Lexus.�� Executives said Lexus models launched earlier this year, such as the Lexus GS 350, have gained traction.“We needed new product and we’re getting it now,�� Morrison said. “Everything we’ve launched seems to be working well, knock on wood.”In 2011, BMW AG won the luxury sales crown followed by Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz and then Lexus.In the first five months of 2012, Lexus sales were up 14 percent to just over 88,000. It trails Mercedes-Benz and BMW respectively. Mercedes sold 113,520 cars through May 2012, up 19 percent. BMW sales were up 14 percent to 104,779.	0.2630540576
BEIJING (Reuters) - When 32-year-old photographer Jaco Xu needed a run-around car for work in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the price tag on the latest micro EV from GM's GM.N China joint venture overcame his qualms about electric vehicles.Xu paid 38,800 yuan ($5,735) for his tiny two-door Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, while the basic model retails for just 28,800 yuan ($4,200), making it China’s cheapest EV.“It feels pretty good. The price is so low and the appearance is simple and beautiful,�� said Xu. “Why would I hesitate at that price?”Launched in July, the Wuling MINI is heading a trend towards a new segment of EVs in China following changes to government subsidies - smaller vehicles with less range between charges, but a super-cheap price tag.Despite basic features - no safety air bags, optional air-conditioning and a driving range of less than 200 km (125 miles) due to a smaller battery - buyers have been enthusiastic.SGMW, GM's venture with partners SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS and Guangxi Automobile Group, sold about 15,000 of the vehicles in August, making it China's top-selling EV for the month, surpassing Tesla's TSLA.O popular Model 3.The venture plans to expand manufacturing capabilities of the new model, turning out cars at its plant in Liuzhou as well as its existing facilities in Qingdao, said Zhou Xing, SGMW’s branding and marketing director.“We positioned this model as a ‘people’s commuting tool��,�� he said, speaking ahead of the Beijing auto show which starts on Saturday. “Customers can drive their cars to work every day.”The target market includes people like Xu who are looking for a city-run around as a second car, rural buyers who want a vehicle to move goods and young first-time buyers who are motivated by price.Total sales of new energy vehicles -- including electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles -- are expected to reach 1.1 million vehicles in China this year, about 5% of total auto sales.The micro car represents a shift in what typifies a mainstream electric vehicle, as policymakers push for increased EV production and sales have been bolstered by restrictions on petrol-fuelled cars.In response to government requirements to win generous EV subsidies, automakers over the past decade have developed higher energy-density battery systems to allow cars to drive for longer with a single charge.Tesla’s Model 3, which has a range of over 400 km, has been the market leader in China for most of 2020, retailing for about $43,000, about 10 times the cost of the Wuling MINI.However, China cut subsidies heavily in 2019 and is now asking for higher EV power efficiency to save energy. Automakers, in turn, are planning more smaller EVs with a moderate driving range aimed at customers who can charge cars easily, industry executives said.The economics are skinny. Wuling MINI will not get EV subsidies due to its short range. For SGMW, the cheap price tag means it makes very little money at best, according to insiders familiar with the matter.EVs, however, generate green credits for SGMW that can be used to offset negative credits of other companies like SGM, its sister venture which is expanding a lineup of bigger SUVs under Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac marques.“Selling micro EVs in China makes more sense this year,�� said a product planning official at a GM rival.“Subsidies have become a less important factor of pricing as government has already cut a lot, while green credits are expected to become more expensive,�� the official said.Bidding to reverse a sales decline due to a slower economy and stiff competition, GM expects EVs to make up more than 40% of its new launches in China over the next five years.The Detroit automaker is revamping plants in Shanghai, Wuhan and Liuzhou under its two Chinese JVs to enable production lines making gasoline cars to turn out EVs, public documents detailing its constructions plans show.For now, the Wuling MINI is the cheapest EV, but it faces competition from the cheapest models from rivals BYD 002594.SZ and BAIC BluePark 600733.SS.Great Wall Motor 601633.SS and Toyota's 7203.T China partner GAC 601238.SS are also planning more electric models with a range below 400 km, company officials said this month.And startup Kaiyun Motors is trying to radically lower the price of its new electric pickup truck Pixel to around 20,000 yuan for urban delivery services, although these EVs will be sold without batteries, allowing consumers to swap them.“China is a huge market, any product with clear positioning can attract enough customers to survive,�� said Kaiyun founder Wang Chao.	-0.09024592013
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.TTM.N said on Wednesday it is expanding by 331,200 cars worldwide its recall involving potentially defective Takata Corp 7312.T air bag parts.Toyota earlier on Wednesday said the new recalls totaled 356,000 globally but later lowered the figure.An estimated 29 million Takata air bag inflators have been recalled in the United States in more than 19 million vehicles because the inflators can activate with too much force, sending potentially deadly metal shards into the passenger compartment.All the vehicle Toyota added to the recalls are equipped with a Takata-made dual-stage front passenger air bag inflator.Toyota said the new recalls increased the number of Toyota vehicles with Takata air bags worldwide to 15,314,000, including 3,156,000 in the United States.U.S.-registered vehicles account for 198,000 of the freshly recalled vehicles. The total in North America is 231,000 vehicles.The new recall in the United States will include the 2008 Corolla and Corolla Matrix models as well as 2008 to 2010 model years Lexus SC 430 vehicles.In Europe, 86,000 vehicles will be added to the existing recalls of Avensis and Lexus SC430 models. Model years were not available.Added recalls in Japan number 3,000 and include Avensis and Lexus SC 430 models made from May 2007 to July 2010.There will be another 220 vehicles recalled in Asia.In other regions, Toyota is adding another 11,000 vehicles to the recalls, including Avensis, Corolla, Corolla Matrix and Lexus SC 430 models.Reuters has reported that U.S. auto safety regulators are examining whether an additional 70 million to 90 million Takata air bag inflators should be recalled.	-6.622455559
(Refiles to remove extraneous text from headline, with no other changes to text)BERLIN, Sept 14 (Reuters) - European car sales rose 5.5 percent in August, accelerating from an increase of 2.6 percent in July, according to industry data published on Thursday.Registrations rose to 903,143 vehicles in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries in August and to 1.19 million vehicles for July, Brussels-based industry body ACEA said.For the first eight months of the year, registrations were up 4.4 percent to 10.56 million vehicles.In the 28-nation EU excluding Malta, registrations climbed 5.6 percent to 865,047 vehicles in August, the best August performance in a decade, ACEA said.Europe’s largest carmaker, Volkswagen, which is still grappling with its diesel emissions scandal, saw August deliveries rise 2.8 percent, with its namesake brand down 4.4 percent.Among the major manufacturers, Renault and Toyota saw the biggest monthly increases with 13 percent and 12.5 percent, followed by Fiat Chrysler with 9.8 percent.Performance was mixed for the region’s two biggest markets. Germany saw a 3.5 percent increase, while Britain registered a 6.4 percent drop, continuing a 9.3 percent fall seen in July. (Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Maria Sheahan)	5.397096499
VALENCIA, Venezuela, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Though it is the middle of the work day, the Jeep assembly plant in the central Venezuelan city of Valencia is empty, the machinery still.The factory, which once employed more than 1,000 workers, made its last car five months ago. Now assembly lines at the plant, located in the oil-rich country’s industrial heartland, are quiet. Workers were sent home after raw materials ran out.Venezuela’s economic crisis threatens to paralyze what was once South America’s third-largest automotive industry, as stagnation in oil production and a badly managed currency control system stymie private businesses�� access to foreign currencies and ability to import supplies.“They are asking to fire 119 workers,�� union leader Henry Ospina, who represents employees of Chrysler, which makes Jeeps, told Reuters in Valencia. “We’re fighting, but the company says everyday it’s harder to maintain staff costs.”Like Chrysler, a subsidiary of Italian company Fiat , plants belonging to Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Iveco, part of CNH Industrial ; Mack, a subsidiary of Swedish Volvo ; and Mitsubishi are all operating at minimum capacity.Production in 2014 has fallen 83 percent year-on-year, with just 7,000 cars built, compared with some 43,000 made during the same period last year.Only 876 vehicles were produced in July, an 87 percent plunge from the same month in 2013, according to the Venezuelan Automotive Chamber.The auto industry says it is owed $1.9 billion in dollar liquidations by the government of President Nicolas Maduro.While officials have denied currency problems, on the black market dollars sell for 70 bolivars, more than 10 times the lowest government rate of 6.3.The state will protect workers and speed up access to dollars for auto manufacturers, Francisco Ameliach - an ally of Maduro and governor of Carabobo state, where Valencia is located - promised companies and unions in a meeting last week.Maduro, who succeeded longtime leader Hugo Chavez after the firebrand politician’s death in 2013, had previously said auto manufacturers were to blame for the crisis.At the end of last year the government accused General Motors of selling replacement parts at inflated prices, and fined the company nearly $85,000.In February, when Toyota said it intended to close its Venezuelan plant, Maduro accused the world’s No. 1 automaker of waging an “economic war�� against him.The crisis has translated into reduced paychecks, hitting the wallets of workers who are also contending with inflation of more than 60 percent.Dozens of managers have accepted offers to leave their posts, circumventing strict labor laws that make firing employees extremely difficult, workers told Reuters.“In all of the automotive industry, 1,500 jobs are at risk,�� said Cristian Pereira, the president of a union federation which includes workers from all areas of the sector.

TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japanese auto maker Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it would raise the monthly base salary for workers by 4,000 yen ($33), its biggest hike in over a decade, joining other major domestic firms in agreeing to larger rises in annual wage talks.The rise was short of union demands for 6,000 yen per month, but up from last year’s 2,700 yen hike. Earlier, electronics firm Panasonic Corp and auto maker Nissan Motor Co Ltd announced monthly base-pay rises of 3,000 yen and 5,000 yen respectively.Higher wages are considered key to sustaining growth and decisively ending deflation in the world’s third-biggest economy. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has been calling for Japan Inc - sitting on record levels of cash amid hefty profits - to do its part in stimulating the economy and lift workers�� pay.	-1.177898344
(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s North America unit said on Thursday it was conducting the final phase of a safety recall to replace potentially faulty Takata airbag inflators in about 928,000 vehicles.Previously installed Takata inflators will be replaced by those produced by other suppliers ahead of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s schedule, the company said.At least 24 deaths worldwide have been linked to the rupturing of faulty Takata air bag inflators, including 16 in the United States.The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017.Toyota said owners of vehicles recalled in the United States would be notified by mid-December.	5.767106135
WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Two former executives of Nishikawa Rubber Co and one current executive from the company were indicted on Thursday for allegedly conspiring to fix the prices of weather-stripping and rubber seals for cars made in the United States.The U.S. Justice Department identified the three executives as Keiji Kyomoto, Mikio Katsumaru and Yuji Kuroda, all of Japan. They were associated with Nishikawa Rubber Co, according to profiles of company executives.The Justice Department, and antitrust enforcers around the world, have had a long-running investigation into price-fixing of auto parts. Thirty-seven companies have pleaded guilty as part of the probe, and 58 executives have been charged.The conspiracy affecting automotive sealing products, which ran from September 2003 to October 2011, affected products sold to Honda Motor Company Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp and their U.S. affiliates, the Justice Department said in a statement.In addition to the price-fixing allegations, Katsumaru and Kuroda encouraged company employees to destroy evidence in order to hide the probe, according to the department.“These executives conspired for years with their competitors to fix the prices of body sealing products sold to Honda and Toyota and installed in U.S. cars,�� Brent Snyder, of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said in a statement. “The Antitrust Division will continue to vigorously prosecute executives who orchestrate their companies�� efforts to break the law.��	-0.3099510604
Busch breaks jinx with NASCAR Nationwide Series win at KansasBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeKANSAS CITY, Kan. -- Kyle Busch won the lottery on Saturday afternoon -- the Kansas Lottery 300, to be precise.But it must have seemed like a huge jackpot for the driver of the No. 54 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, who won a NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Kansas Speedway for the first time since 2007.“Whoo! We won at Kansas,�� Busch radioed as he crossed the finish line, with as much relief as elation in his voice.It took Busch 19 circuits after a restart on Lap 161 to catch and pass runner-up Kevin Harvick. On Lap 180, Busch ducked down to the apron near the start/finish line and powered past Harvick into the lead.From that point, Busch pulled away for his sixth Nationwide Series victory of the season and the 69th of his career, extending his own series record.The Kansas drought broken, Busch was already thinking about Sunday’s Hollywood Casino 400, the first race in the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup’s Contender Round. Never having scored a top-five in a Cup race at Kansas, Busch will start seventh on Sunday.“You learn enough here -- there was a bit of moving around today and trying to run bottom and trying to run top and seeing where the different lines were in traffic and stuff like that,�� Busch said. “I feel like our Cup car is OK. If we can get out of here with a top-10 day tomorrow that would be pretty good.“Great effort by (crew chief) Adam (Stevens) and all the guys on this 54 car --it was really awesome again today and should have won at Chicago just like we did here today. Missed out there, but we just keep doing things right, and you end up in Victory Lane, so you have to have it all match up for you.”Harvick had winning chances because his crew chief, Ernie Cope, played a contrarian pit strategy to perfection and got some help from a timely caution. Harvick was the only lead-lap driver to bring his car to pit road under the seventh caution on Lap 91, and that put him in position to wait out a cycle of green-flag stops with roughly 60 laps left.With all other lead-lap cars pitting between Laps 136 and 141, Harvick was the only car on the lead laps when Dakoda Armstrong’s spin brought out the eighth caution. Busch, who was leading before the cycle of stops began, got the free pass as the highest scored lapped car, and the rest of the lead-lappers took wave-arounds after Harvick pitted for fuel.Harvick led the field to green on Lap 153 but couldn’t keep Busch at bay on longer runs.“They gave us a good opportunity with strategy there, (but) the 54 was quite a bit better as we got going into the run,�� Harvick said. “We could hold him off for a short run, but in the end his car would maintain speed, and ours would slow down.“We just got beat there today, but that happens.”The race dealt a crushing blow to Regan Smith’s championship hopes. Smith spun and backed into the wall during qualifying earlier in the day and was forced to start from the rear of the field in a backup car.On Lap 140, the sway bar arm on Smith’s No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet broke, and he took the car behind the wall for repairs, losing seven laps in the process. Smith finished 22nd and fell 38 points behind teammate Chase Elliott in the series standings.Ty Dillon, third in the championship battle, ran fifth Saturday and is 40 points behind Elliott, who finished 10th, with four races left in the season.“Any time you have to roll a backup car out two hours before a race, you have to expect anything to happen,�� said Smith, who just re-signed for another year with JR Motorsports�� Nationwide program. “My guys did a great job of getting the car ready to where we could get to the grid with it, much less be competitive for the first stage of the race.“We fought with it. It’s kind of what we anticipated for the day and at this point -- obviously disappointed. It’s been a long year.”NASCAR Nationwide Series Race -- Kansas Lottery 300Kansas SpeedwayKansas City, KansasSaturday, Oct. 4, 20141. (6) Kyle Busch(i), Toyota, 200, $75075.2.

BEIJING/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co 7201.T takes the veil off the first car in its resurrected Datsun brand in New Delhi on Monday - a sub-400,000-rupee ($6,700) hatchback that is part of a foray by the Japanese auto maker into cheap cars for emerging markets.With the Datsun hatchback and other Datsun models to follow over the next three years - one of which could be priced as low as $4,000 (240,000 rupees) if Nissan can meet its aggressive manufacturing cost objectives - Nissan is treading ever so closer to the ultra-low-cost car market.That market in India is now famously occupied by the Tata Nano, a barebones car that retails for between 150,000 and 220,000 rupees.“We try to keep the price positioning for Datsun competitive, so that products are appealing�� to the lower half of the auto market in India where Nissan has few products competing today, Nissan’s program director for Datsun, Ashwani Gupta, told Reuters in an interview.It is a move that has been generally resisted so far by other global auto giants, such as Toyota Motor Corp.7203.T, out of concern a scruffy, ultra-cheap car model could tarnish their high-value brands.Top Toyota executives, including current chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, rejected a chief engineer’s design for a low-cost emerging market car several years ago, saying it was too cheap to be called a Toyota, an engineering executive said.The car has since undergone some design iterations and was finally launched in India in 2010 as the Toyota Etios sedan, which starts at 545,000 rupees. A hatchback version of the car, launched in 2011, starts at about 450,000 rupees.Since Nissan plans to market Datsun cars in India through its existing Nissan-branded dealerships, Datsun could expose the Japanese auto maker to similar risks, though executives downplay the possibility.They say use of a separate brand name should effectively shield Nissan’s brand image. Datsun, which Nissan once used for its cars outside Japan, has a history dating back to the 1930s.“We’re serving different customers�� with Datsun, said Tatjana Natarova, a Datsun spokeswoman. “That’s why we came up with a different brand.”To make Datsun cars affordable, Nissan has been aiming to reduce manufacturing costs to $3,000 to $5,000 per vehicle. The first car is due for a launch in India early next year and Gupta said the company has partially achieved the cost goals.Still, as price-competitive as that may be, it will face formidable competition from Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, which together control two-thirds of India's passenger car market, excluding SUVs and vans.Maruti has about 1,200 retail stores in India, while Hyundai operates a network of more than 350 stores. Nissan, by contrast, has only about 100 dealers, though it says it plans to triple the number of its stores to 300 by March 2017.Nissan said last year it would revive the Datsun name as a marquee for emerging markets, starting with India, Russia and Indonesia. Eventually, it wants to expand into Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.To make the new name stick, Nissan does not plan to stop with a sub-400,000-rupee car. It plans to expand the Datsun brand’s appeal by following its first car with a second model by the end of next year and a third vehicle by 2016.Nissan is still trying to meet the goal of producing a Datsun car for as little as $3,000 per vehicle, said an executive speaking on condition of anonymity.“If we met that, there would be a good possibility we could offer the car for $4,000 on the retail market,�� the executive said.That is not as cheap as the Nano, but Nissan is not aiming to compete head-on with the Nano any way, the executive said.By the year ending March 2017, Nissan wants to capture 10 percent of India’s overall passenger vehicle market that includes sedans, sport-utility vehicles and vans. Nissan had a market share of less than 1 percent as of May, data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers shows.By then, Datsun aims to generate one third to a half of overall sales in India, which bought 2.7 million passenger vehicles in the year ended March 2013, Gupta said.To achieve low manufacturing costs, the Datsun product team designed and engineered cars so that “nearly all�� the components needed to build them could be procured within India, Gupta said.India has a relatively limited auto parts supply base so procuring almost all the necessary components locally poses a challenge. Gupta said though that Nissan aims to pull off the feat not only in India, but in Indonesia and Russia as well.Gupta said Datsun cars would be stripped of features and functions that do not offer “value�� to customers in markets they target to make cars affordable.Nissan thus will likely avoid developing new technology. Instead, it will use tried technology, in particular vehicle underpinnings, engines and transmissions, which are costly to develop. It is also likely to pare down expensive features such as power-windows, navigation systems, and extra safety airbags.	0.4319654428
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s auto sales in May rose 14.5% from the same month a year earlier, industry data showed on Thursday, the second consecutive month of increase as the world’s biggest vehicle market recovers from lows hit during coronavirus lockdowns.The result followed a 4.4% rise in April and a 43% drop in March, when the pandemic pummelled demand. Before April, sales had suffered an almost two-year slump.For an interactive graphic on China auto sales, click tmsnrt.rs/3fhNaIBSales in May rose to 2.19 million vehicles, showed data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), the country’s largest auto industry association.Government support policies and improving consumer confidence contributed the May growth, said senior CAAM official Chen Shihua during an online briefing.However, developments with the global pandemic might impact overseas demand for China-made vehicles, Chen said.In May, sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) fell for an 11th month to 82,000 units, the data showed. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.Automakers including Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175.HK, Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and the United States' Ford Motor Co F.N reported positive China sales in May.CAAM last month said annual auto sales could fall 15% to 25% due to, for instance, government restrictions on movement and business aimed at containing the novel coronavirus.The outlook indicates challenges ahead as the industry works to emerge from the prolonged slump in demand, which was also exacerbated by a trade war with the United States.Xu Haidong, another CAAM official, said the industry body now thinks China’s full-year auto sales will be better than expectations for a 15% fall. He did not elaborate.	0.4901960784
TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average slipped from a two-month high on Tuesday as concerns about further waves of coronavirus infections undermined recent optimism on economic re-openings.Toyota Motor, the biggest Japanese company by market cap, fell 2.0% after the automaker warned its operating profit will fall almost 80% in the current financial year.The Nikkei share average ended down 0.12% at 20,366.48 points, a day after it hit a two-month high. It has risen 18.7% from a trough hit on March 19.Investors�� confidence has improved as more governments relax anti-virus measures and try to get economies back on their feet, but news of a rise infections in countries that had appeared to be containing the disease, such as China, South Korea and Germany, dented optimism.Some market players noted the rally in the market has been based on expectations that the economy would quickly recover after a dismal April-June quarter, though many economists warn it could take much longer.“When you think of earnings outlook and dire economic conditions, it is hard to expect the market to rise further from here,�� said Takuya Hozumi, global investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Highlighting the magnitude of the damage from the pandemic, the president of Toyota Motor told reporters its impact would be bigger than the 2008 global financial crisis. Other cyclical shares were badly hit. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings fell 8.7% after the department store operator posted a loss for the financial ended March.Bridgestone slipped 4.0% after the tyre maker posted a 65% fall in net profit for January-March, compared with a year earlier, and withdrew its annual forecast.Kawasaki Heavy Industries sank 5.7% as the firm halved its annual dividend to save cash.Even sharper dividend cuts came from one real estate investment trust (REIT),Invincible Investment fell 22.7%, its daily limit, after the hotel REIT slashed its dividend by 98%.The TSE’s REIT index dropped 2.2% from two-month high touched a day earlier on worries other funds may follow suit.On the other hand, semi-conductor related shares were among the best performers on expectations of increased internet traffic after the coronavirus.Sumco Corp rose 3.3% and Advantest Corp gained 2.3%.Semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Tokyo Seimitsu rose 3.2% on strong earnings.Square Enix Holdings Co Ltd rose 4.8% after the online entertainment company raised its profit estimate for the financial year ended March and hiked its dividend.“I think the market is still retaining an uptrend,�� said Yuya Fukue, trader at Rheos Capital Works.“At the same time, I expect the polarisation of the market to continue. The tech sector will flourish as it is becoming an important infrastructure for the society.”The broader Topix fell 0.26% to 1,476.72.

(Reuters) - U.S automakers will have another six months to meet “quiet car�� regulations requiring electric and hybrid vehicles to emit alert sounds to warn pedestrians when they approach, a federal regulator said on Friday, citing the coronavirus pandemic.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was seeking public comment on whether to extend the deadline by a full year, as requested in April by a group representing major automakers, including General Motors Co GM.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.The carmakers asked NHTSA to extend the Sept. 1 deadline for full compliance by another year. The agency on Friday opted to extend the date for full compliance to March 1, saying it believes the six-month delay “strikes a reasonable balance between providing necessary regulatory relief and implementing�� the requirements as quickly as possible.The long-delayed rules, first demanded by Congress in 2010, require automakers to add sounds to vehicles when they are moving at speeds of up to 18.6 miles per hour (30 km per hour) to help prevent injuries among pedestrians, cyclists and the blind.The National Federation of the Blind praised NHTSA’s decision in a joint statement with the auto trade group Auto Innovators, which had sought the delay.Automakers noted the earlier shutdown of North American auto production “impacted the ability of manufacturers to fully implement the quiet car rule.”NHTSA in September 2019 gave automakers an additional year to comply beyond the schedule proposed by the Obama administration.Automakers are selling more electrically powered vehicles to meet emissions rules, and those are often harder to hear at lower speeds than gasoline-powered engines.At higher speeds, tire noise, wind resistance, and other factors eliminate the need for alert sounds, regulators say.NHTSA estimated the rules would cost the auto industry about $40 million annually because automakers will need to add an external waterproof speaker to comply; benefits of reduced injuries are estimated at $250 million to $320 million annually.NHTSA estimates the odds of a hybrid vehicle being involved in a pedestrian crash are 19% higher than with a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle. About 125,000 pedestrians and cyclists are injured annually on U.S. roads.	2.703314959
BEIJING, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd and its Chinese joint venture partner sold 1.25 million vehicles in China in 2015, up 6.3 percent from the previous year, the Japanese car maker said on Wednesday.In December, Nissan sold 159,100 vehicles, up 15 percent from a year earlier. That compares with a 21.9 percent increase in November and a 16.8 percent rise in October.Japanese automakers have outperformed the expected 3 percent growth of the overall Chinese car market, the world’s largest, where consumer appetite for cars waned under the slowest economic expansion in 25 years and a stock market rout.Nissan, which operates a car venture in China with Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd, revised its 2015 China forecast in November to 1.25 million units from 1.3 million previously.Rival Toyota Motor Corp forecast on Tuesday that sales would rise roughly 2.7 percent in 2016 year-on-year, less than half its 2015 growth rate of 8.7 percent.

PARIS (Reuters) - Toyota 7203.T has agreed to buy out PSA Group's PEUP.PA stake in a jointly-managed Czech Republic factory specializing in the production of small cars, the companies said on Friday.The French firm will also supply another model of compact van for its Japanese partner from its Vigo plant in Spain as of 2019, they added in a statement.Toyota will take full ownership of the Czech plant of Kolin from January 2021, and the factory will continue to produce “the current generation�� of compact cars for the two companies.It currently turns out Peugeot 108, Citroen C1 and Toyota Argo models.“Toyota intends to continue production and employment in the future at the Kolin plant,�� the companies said, without disclosing financial details.PSA already assembles vans for Toyota at its Sevelnord plant in northern France.	-6.01570723
TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo’s taxi industry is undergoing some radical changes as Japan, already dealing with unprecedented levels of tourism, gears up to host two major sporting events in the next 26 months.More than 28 million tourists visited Japan in 2017 and the government has set a goal of 40 million foreign visitors by 2020, loading more and more pressure on Tokyo’s already stressed transport system.Toyota, the world’s largest car manufacturer, believes it has at least part of the answer to this problem.Anyone who has hailed a cab in the Japanese capital is likely to have enjoyed a ride in one of the company’s iconic Comfort sedans, which make up over 70 percent of Tokyo’s taxi fleet.The car, which famously features an automatic opening door, has been in production for 22 years but in October last year Toyota launched a new model, the ‘JPN Taxi��.Adoption of the ‘JPN Taxi��, which has a liquid petroleum gas hybrid engine aimed at lowering carbon emissions, has been gradual but Toyota say 10 percent of all Tokyo’s taxi drivers have made the switch.By the start of the Olympic Games in July 2020, the aim is for the new model to make up over a third of the fleet as Tokyo looks to make itself more accessible for those with disabilities as well as the country’s ageing population.Japan has the world’s highest proportion of elderly people with 27 percent of the population over the age of 65 and Toyota’s new car reflects this changing demographic.“The very reason why we selected the universal design concept is because Japan is a super-aging society, at a level we do not see in other countries in the world,�� chief engineer Hiroshi Kayukawa told Reuters at Toyota’s head office in Aichi Prefecture.“We are seeing the cities becoming more and more barrier-free, but we also think public transportation should do more in this direction. That was the whole idea around this concept.”The back seats of the ‘JPN Taxi�� can be moved and a ramp, neatly tucked away under the seat, can be installed in seconds to accommodate customers in wheelchairs. There are also yellow markings and a light on the floor to aid the visually impaired.“After the Olympics in Tokyo were decided, we looked into our concept and thought there would be a lot of convenience for tourists as well,�� added Kayukawa.“There is also the potential that this taxi becomes an icon of Japan for foreigners visiting Japan.”To that end, much thought was given to the choice of color for the exterior before Toyota selected Koiai, a deep indigo once derived from plant dyes.“It is sometimes known as ‘Japan Blue��,�� said Kayukawa, who hopes the new model will become associated with Tokyo much as the black taxi is with London and the yellow cab with New York.“It just so happens to be the color of the Olympic logo for Tokyo 2020 so we find that a happy coincidence and we hope that deep indigo becomes the image color of Japan.”The make-up of the army of drivers who patrol the streets of Tokyo is also changing.Hinomaru, one of the largest taxi firms in the city, have recently hired 22 foreign drivers in time for next year’s Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Olympic Games.With the average age of taxi drivers in Tokyo at almost 60 and a shortage of suitable drivers, Hinomaru started recruiting its foreign drivers last year.Austrian Wolfgang Loeger, who has lived in Japan for over 30 years and until recently was a chef and ski instructor in the countryside, is one.After moving to Tokyo last year and in need of a new job, Loeger found his calling behind the wheel.“I saw the job advertisement so I thought ‘lets give it a try�� because I like driving and I like to meet people,�� Loeger told Reuters as he navigated through the city.“You meet every time new people in the taxi so I thought it was a nice job.”Loeger, who is married to a local and speaks Japanese fluently, said he causes a stir when customers get into the taxi and see a foreigner in the driving seat.“Of course most of the time they (customers) say it is the first time they say they have had a foreign driver,�� laughed Loeger.“It is a good way to start conversations so usually they ask me where I am from, how long I have driven and these kinds of things.”Hinomaru hopes that by having drivers like Loeger, who can speak a variety of languages, visitors will feel more at home in one of the developed world’s most homogenous societies.With a fleet of spacious, modern cars, driven by characters such as Loeger, visitors to Japan for the Olympics can expect a comfortable ride on the streets of Tokyo in 2020.	-2.840614107

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T should decide by the first quarter of 2018 on a location for a new U.S. vehicle assembly plant it will build with Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, the head of Toyota's North American operations said on Monday.“The final decision has not been made,�� Jim Lentz, chief executive of Toyota North America, told Reuters in an interview in Detroit. More than one state remains in the running for the $1.6 billion plant, Lentz said.Toyota and Mazda’s plan to build a new U.S. factory is part of a broader wave of investment in North American production capacity by European and Asian automakers. The increased vehicle-making capacity is coming despite forecasts that U.S. vehicle demand is hitting a plateau.The new factory is part of a broader realignment of Toyota’s production and supply chain in North America. The new plant is expected to build an SUV for Mazda, and Corolla compact cars for Toyota. The Canadian plant that currently builds Corollas will be able to build more SUVs. Toyota also plans a factory in Guanajuato, Mexico that will build Tacoma pickup trucks, freeing up Toyota’s existing factory in San Antonio, Texas to build more Tundra large pickups.Toyota’s production strategy for North America could be disrupted if negotiations among the United States, Mexico and Canada to amend the North American Free Trade Agreement fail, and U.S. President Donald Trump decides to exit the trade pact.“I think the government will make the right decision,�� Lentz said. “They will tweak, rather than throw out�� the existing agreement that allows tariff-free trade in vehicles and components.	6.856403622
DETROIT (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T said on Thursday it will expand to additional states its recall of vehicles with Takata Corp 7312.T passenger-side air bags after U.S. regulators requested it.Mazda was among 10 automakers that began in June to conduct regional recalls of vehicles with passenger-side front-seat air bags supplied by Takata, at the request of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.NHTSA previously requested and Mazda recalled vehicles in a limited area covering Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and U.S. Virgin Islands.Mazda’s recall area now includes Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia as well as Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa.Including models recalled earlier, Mazda will tell owners of about 87,000 vehicles with Takata passenger-side air bags to bring them to dealerships for replacement parts.Defective Takata air bag inflators, which can explode and shoot shrapnel into the car, have been linked to five deaths. More than 16 million cars have been recalled globally since 2008.Last month, Takata declared that the passenger-side air bags may be defective in the wider area.The Japan-based supplier says that manufacturing problems could lead to defects if the inflators are in high-humidity areas for extended periods.This action is separate from a NHTSA demand for five automakers including Mazda to recall nationwide certain older-model vehicles with Takata-made driver-side air bags. Mazda has yet to say whether it will comply with the request. Germany’s BMW has also not responded to NHTSA’s request.Other carmakers including Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp have already agreed to go nationwide with the driver-side air bag recall, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has so far refused.Mazda said in a press statement issued Thursday that it has agreed to join an initiative proposed by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T for independent, industrywide joint tests of Takata air bag inflators.(This story fixes verb tense in second paragraph)	-4.386576765

GENEVA (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Germany's BMW BMWG.DE are still keen to develop a common sportscar architecture but have yet to decide on a timeline for the project, a senior executive at the Japanese carmaker said on Monday. BMW and Toyota have for some years been collaborating on fuel cell technology, lightweight components, and on possibly jointly developing the underpinnings of a sportscar, which would spawn separate vehicles for each brand.Speaking ahead of the Geneva auto show, Toyota executive vice president Didier Leroy said all three projects were going very well and there was strong support for the sportscar from both firms.“On both sides we have strong motivation to make it successful, we want to make the car,�� Leroy said. “We know exactly which kind of body we want to do, we know exactly which kind of powertrain we want to use ... now we just have to decide by when we want to start this car.”He declined to comment on a possible timeframe.Toyota’s sales in Europe, which for the carmaker counts 56 countries, including Israel, Russia and Turkey, fell slightly to 874,000 vehicles last year as higher deliveries in the western part of the region failed to offset a sharp drop in Russia.But volumes are seen returning to growth in 2016.“In 2014 we sold 888,000, and we’ve set ourselves a target of stepping above that (in 2016),�� Toyota’s head for Europe Johan van Zyl said at the same event. He expects overall industry sales in the region to grow by 1 percent this year.Some 70 percent of Toyota’s vehicles sold in Europe last year were produced in the region. The carmaker expects to increase that percentage this year by adding two localized models, the C-HR crossover that will be manufactured in Turkey and the RAV4 that will be assembled in Russia.Van Zyl said Toyota was committed to the Russian market, despite the challenges there. In 2015, total car industry sales in Russia plunged by 36 percent to 1.6 million.“We will not give up on the Russian market ... we will keep on investing to prepare ourselves for when the market recovers,�� he said.Van Zyl said Toyota expected hybrid vehicles to make up half of its sales in Europe by 2020 from 24 percent last year.	-0.08457851706

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako rode through central Tokyo on Sunday in a motorcade to mark this year’s imperial succession as well-wishers waved national flags and held up mobile phones for snapshots of the smiling royal couple.Emperor Naruhito, 59, acceded to the throne in May after his father, Akihito, became the first monarch to abdicate in two centuries.The parade was originally due to take place on Oct. 22, when the emperor officially proclaimed his enthronement before dignitaries from about 190 countries, but it was postponed as Japan grappled with the aftermath of a devastating typhoon.Under a cloudless blue sky, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, Harvard-educated former diplomat, waved from an open-top Toyota Century limousine, which cruised through streets lined with spectators and police.The emperor wore a tailcoat and Empress Masako a white dress and a tiara that sparkled in the sunshine. It was a stark contrast from last month’s enthronement ceremony, in which both wore traditional robes.Empress Masako appeared moved. Japanese media reported she appeared to wipe away an emotional tear during the 4.6-kilometre (2.9 miles) ride.Tens of thousands of spectators from across the country gathered along the route, which was packed many rows deep with cheering, flag-waving well-wishers. The government estimated some 119,000 people attended, public broadcaster NHK said.Some began queuing on Saturday to ensure a good vantage point on the route.“To witness this historical moment with my own eyes and to see the smile of the emperor and empress, I wanted to be in the front,�� said Hiyori Okazaki, who queued from late on Saturday in front of the Imperial Palace.“I couldn’t wait so came last night.”Toshiko Ito, who visited Tokyo with her husband for the procession, said she was thrilled to see the couple.“Emotion welled up and I was so happy that I was about to cry,�� she said.While bands played celebratory music, the 400-metre long motorcade of 46 vehicles, including cars carrying including Crown Prince Akishino, Crown Princess Kiko and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, moved slowly through the streets.About 16.1 billion yen ($147 million) has been earmarked for succession-related ceremonies throughout the year, including Sunday’s parade, up 30% from Akihito’s succession three decades ago.	-2.371432511

TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Japanese shares rallied to a one-week high on Thursday as a rapidly weakening yen, which hit a near 10-month low versus the dollar overnight, lifted wide-ranging exporters, such as automakers.The benchmark Nikkei average was up 0.9% at 23,607.77 by the midday break, after touching its one-week high of 23,806.56 earlier in the session. The broader Topix rose 0.7% to 1,682.77.All but four of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were trading in positive territory, with mining , paper and pulp and transport equipment being the top three performers.The yen dived to its lowest level since early May versus the dollar of 111.60 yen overnight, providing a tailwind for Japanese exporters as a weaker local currency boosts corporate profits when they are repatriated.Toyota Motor Corp climbed 2.3%, while Honda Motor Co Ltd advanced 2.7% and Mazda Motor Corp added 2.3%.The Nikkei’s heavyweight SoftBank Group jumped 3.8% after the tech conglomerate said it plans to borrow up to 500 billion yen ($4.5 billion) from 16 domestic and foreign financial institutions using almost a third of its stake in telco SoftBank Corp as collateral.Elsewhere, Maeda Road Construction dropped 5.8% after the company said it plans to pay a special dividend of 53.6 billion yen to counter a takeover bid by its biggest shareholder Maeda Corp.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Friday said it has suspended production at three plants affected by an explosion earlier this week at a supplier factory, adding that it expected production to fully resume by the beginning of next week.The blast on Monday was at a factory of Aisin Advics Co, a major maker of breaking systems majority owned by Toyota group supplier Aisin Seiki Co.Toyota said it would cancel one of two production shifts on two lines at a plant operated by group company Hino Motors Ltd. Earlier in the day, it scrapped shifts on a line at its Toyota East Japan plant and at a plant operated by group company Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd.The suspensions would be the third this year. They follow supply-chain disruption caused by earthquake damage to a factory operated by an Aisin Seiki subsidiary, and a fire at a steel plant owned by supplier Aichi Steel Corp.“We will continue to monitor the parts supply status and decide on how to proceed with operations on each line as necessary,�� a Toyota spokeswoman said.“We expect a full-scale recovery on June 6.”Toyota did not disclose the estimated impact of the suspensions.	-4.173913043
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Automakers are speeding up U.S. assembly lines to meet recovering demand, increasingly confident coronavirus safety protocols are working to prevent outbreaks in their plants but wary of the challenges workers face outside.Screening workers for COVID-19 using temperature scans and questionnaires, the automakers have detected some people who reported for work despite being sick. Some plants have been briefly shut down for disinfection, but so far, there has not been a major outbreak within a U.S. auto plant since most reopened May 18, company and United Auto Workers union officials said.The risk of an infection picked up outside a plant spreading along assembly lines remains a prime concern, however. An outbreak could shut down a factory costing a manufacturer millions of dollars a day. The disruption caused by the pandemic is creating other challenges as well.At Ford Motor Co's F.N F-series pickup truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky, the company has given more than 1,000 workers leave related to COVID-19 concerns. It hired temporary workers to fill their jobs as the plant accelerates production of trucks critical to Ford's financial recovery.Demand for pickup trucks helped boost U.S. auto sales in May, and contributed to stronger than expected overall U.S. retail sales for the month.Officials of UAW Local 862, which represents workers at the Louisville plant, said a lack of child care was a significant issue for members. It had led many to stay away from the plant and collect increased unemployment benefits provided under the federal CARES coronavirus relief act.Ford has now begun arranging subsidized child care for UAW workers, Gary Johnson, the automaker’s head of manufacturing told Reuters.“As we have rolled out this program in Kentucky and elsewhere, the number of people gone under the CARES Act has dropped,�� Johnson said.On the job, auto workers are required to wear masks and face shields, sit or stand six feet (1.83 meters) apart and avoid touching, following protocols the major manufacturers and the UAW have jointly developed. But outside the plant, there is widespread flouting of mask and social distancing recommendations nationally, union and company officials said.“People leave work and then they have their own protocols outside of the workplace,�� said Gerald Kariem, UAW vice president and director of the union’s Ford department. “But in terms of the workplace, the protocols are probably better than the protocols that you’ll see out in the general public.”With COVID-19 cases rising in some states where it has factories, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T within the past week has redoubled efforts to tell employees at its U.S. plants that the safety protocols they observe on the job should be carried into their lives away from work. The company is adopting the slogan ""Safe Anywhere."" “Once people leave the plant and leave the gates, it becomes hit or miss,�� said Norm Bafunno, vice president of manufacturing for Toyota’s North American operations.Toyota has identified 40 plant employees who came to work, reported symptoms or risk factors for coronavirus infection and turned out to have the virus, company spokeswoman Kelly McNeff said.Managers and workers are trying to improve on the safety procedures instituted when factories reopened. A concern across the industry is how uncomfortable it can be to wear a mask on a fast-moving assembly line as heat and humidity rise.Toyota workers are testing face screens that have small fans installed at the top, run from battery packs, Bafunno said.At Ford, the company is producing enough masks on its own that it can now offer workers up to five a day."	-0.3990922607
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore unveiled its public transport future on Monday, and it was a vision of passengers commuting in driverless buses along roads and freeways populated by platoons of autonomous trucks following a single driver.The city state’s plans to streamline its transport future have begun with two self-driving vehicles going through their paces in a Singapore estate that is home to research facilities and educational institutes.The vehicles are the vanguard of two projects - one run by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) with the National University of Singapore and one by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.Some U.S. states and countries including Germany also allow testing of driverless vehicles on public roads.Singapore, with its limited land and workforce, is hoping that autonomous vehicles will encourage its residents to use more shared vehicles and public transport, and avoid further congestion on its roads.“Trying to look for bus drivers, truck drivers - big challenge for us,�� said Pang Kin Keong, permanent secretary in the ministry of transport.“We don’t have a huge population and these are not some of the professions which Singaporeans aspire to,�� Pang said after taking a ride in SMART-NUS’s driverless car - a modified Mitsubishi Motors Corp electric vehicle with a top speed of 30 km per hour (20 mph).The government and port operator PSA Corp also said on Monday that they would seek proposals to design and implement autonomous truck platooning trials, in which a human-driven truck is followed by other driverless trucks.Autonomous vehicles could spur the mass-market adoption of ride sharing, ultimately resulting in a marked reduction in personally owned vehicles and in the total number of cars on the road, at least within cities, according to a Boston Consulting Group report in April.Google and a number of automotive manufacturers and suppliers have said the technology to build self-driving cars should be ready by 2020.The Singapore government said in June that it was seeking ideas on how autonomous vehicle technology could be harnessed for more land transport options.Singapore’s Land Transport Authority said it had received proposals from eight applicants, including Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], BMW AG and the Toyota group’s trading arm, Toyota Tsusho Corp.	0.5451391757
DETROIT, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co’s 2013 Lexus ES and GS models have an emergency trunk lever that snaps off easily and may trap someone inside, Consumer Reports magazine said on Friday, prompting the automaker and safety regulators to review the problem.The issue was discovered inadvertently when the young son of Jake Fisher, automotive testing director for the magazine, climbed into the trunk of a Lexus ES sedan that Fisher was testing.“My four-year-old son, who is 30 pounds soaking wet, was knocking on the trunk, saying ‘Dad, let me out,’� Fisher, who was standing nearby, said. The lever “had snapped right off.”Since the 2002 model year, cars with trunks have included a lever that glows in the dark, allowing a person to open the trunk from the inside by tugging the handle.But in the Lexus, the lever snaps off when it is pulled toward the driver’s side, Fisher said. It works when the lever is pulled straight down or toward the passenger side.Consumer Reports showed the problem to engineers from Toyota, who were visiting the magazine for other reasons last week, said Toyota spokesman John Hanson. “They showed us the broken latch and obviously it got our attention,�� he said.Toyota took pictures of the latch and now Toyota product quality and design experts in North America and Japan are trying to figure out why the latch broke, Hanson said.Consumer Reports also notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A NHTSA spokesman said the agency “is aware of the issue and is evaluating available information to determine if additional action is warranted.”Toyota is trying to boost its Lexus brand by appealing to younger buyers interested in sportier cars. Lexus yielded its top spot in the U.S. luxury market last year due to lost sales after the Japan earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.Earlier this week, a Toyota executive said it faced “high hurdles�� to achieving the brand’s 500,000 global sales target after sales slumped in China.	1.955123999
TOKYO/DETROIT, June 22 (Reuters) - A year ago, Japan’s Takata Corp, the world’s second-largest maker of auto safety parts, believed it had finally contained a crisis more than a decade in the making.It was wrong.More than a million Honda Motor Co Ltd vehicles could be subject to an upcoming recall for Takata air bags that are at risk of exploding and shooting shrapnel at passengers and drivers, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.That would be in addition to 7.6 million vehicles already recalled by Honda and other automakers over the past five years.And the total could grow further still if Honda’s rivals like Nissan, Mazda and BMW also decide to fix more vehicles that were made in a two-year period when, Takata says, it botched production of air bag inflators and lost related records.The possible additional recalls would come at a time when General Motors is under scrutiny over why it took more than a decade to discover a faulty ignition switch linked to at least 13 deaths. As automakers promote over-the-horizon breakthroughs like self-driving cars, the industry’s mass safety-related recalls underline how much can still go wrong with some of the cheapest, most established technologies.In April and May 2013, Takata’s customers, led by Honda and Toyota Motor Corp, recalled more than 4 million vehicles due to the risk that defective air bag inflators could blow apart and shoot metal shards into vehicles in the event of an accident.Those 2013 recalls, which ranked as the largest ever for an air bag defect, contributed to a $300 million charge for Takata.Takata and Honda told U.S. safety regulators that the core of the problem was how the explosive material used to inflate Takata air bags had been handled and processed between 2000 and 2002 at plants in the United States and Mexico.The 2013 recalls involving Honda and four other carmakers were intended to close the books on a problem that had emerged as early as 2007 and had already been linked to two deaths.But just weeks after the 2013 recalls, on May 14, a 10-year-old Honda Fit was involved in an accident in western Japan that raised doubts about whether these recalls had gone far enough.The Fit’s passenger-side air bag exploded, according to Honda and Japan’s transport ministry. There were no injuries in the accident, in Okayama, so police did not give details, but safety investigators found the metal ejected by the air bag was so hot it set fire to the instrument panel and glove compartment.Honda was immediately concerned. The Fit had not been part of earlier recalls and it raised a doubt about whether more defective parts could be in circulation than previously identified. Honda engineers spent six months but failed to recreate the explosion, the company said.In November, Honda told Japan’s safety regulators it was still investigating a new air bag explosion case but did not see the need for another recall. A month later, it said in a statement to Reuters: “We have confirmed that (Takata) has conducted cause analysis and implemented counter measures, and that in the production process it is taking preventive measures.”Then, this month, Honda’s larger rival, Toyota, recalled another 650,000 cars in Japan for defective Takata air bags and called back 1.6 million vehicles previously recalled overseas, an unusual step.A complication, Toyota said, was that Takata’s records had proven to be incomplete. Takata spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa confirmed that the company had discovered a problem with records kept at its plant in Monclova, Mexico.Short of replacement parts from Takata, Toyota has decided to turn off air bags in Japan as customers come to dealerships with recalled vehicles, judging an inoperable passenger-side air bag to be safer than a potentially defective one.Meanwhile, Honda is moving to expand its own recalls, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. That could include more than a million more vehicles. Honda could also recall the 2003 Fit. “If we decide it is necessary, we will take measures quickly,�� Honda said in a statement.Other automakers are expected to follow. Nissan said it would take “prompt action as necessary��. Mazda and Chrysler said they were investigating. BMW said it was in touch with Takata and regulators.Yet more vehicles could be recalled if an ongoing U.S. safety investigation finds evidence of wider problems.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is examining whether Takata inflators made after 2002 are prone to fail and whether driving in high humidity contributes to the risk for air bag explosions.That would go beyond the manufacturing glitches that Takata and Honda previously identified.In a statement, Takata said it had come to believe humidity could be contributing to air bag explosions. The company said it had been working with NHTSA for several months.“Takata is committed to the highest standards of safety for our customers and their customers,�� Takata Chief Executive Shigehisa Takada said in the statement. “Takata is committed to ensuring the safety and functionality of its air bag inflators, and we strive to avoid any malfunction.”Takata spokesman Alby Berman said he could not comment beyond the statement.Takada, who could not be reached directly for further comment, is the son of Juichiro Takada, who took his Tokyo-based family run business from seatbelts into the production of air bags from the late 1980s.Like other suppliers, Takata relies on auto manufacturers to make the final determination on the scope and timing of recalls and has typically left disclosure of defects to them.Since the recalls in April and May last year, there have been at least six cases of Takata inflators exploding in the United States and two in Japan.In August, an inflator ruptured in a 2005 Honda Civic in the United States, sending a “one-inch piece of shrapnel into the driver’s right eye��, according to a complaint filed with NHTSA.In January, a 2002 Toyota Corolla in Shizuoka, Japan had its air bag explode, sending hot shrapnel into the car. The passenger seat was burned, Toyota has said.NHTSA said this month it was examining whether moisture from humidity could be seeping inside inflators designed to be airtight. That could make the volatile propellant inside the inflators unstable, experts have said.NHTSA is also looking at Takata inflators supplied after 2002. Its probe includes an examination of air bag explosions in a 2005 Mazda 6, a 2006 Dodge Charger and a 2004 Nissan Sentra.Chrysler, maker of the Dodge Charger, had not previously been involved in the Takata recall. The Sentra had previously only been recalled for the 2002 and 2003 model years.Air bags, including those made by Takata, have saved thousands of lives since their widespread adoption in the 1990s, automakers, regulators and safety advocates agree.But in order to work, air bags need to inflate in less than half the time it takes to blink an eye, just 40 milliseconds on the passenger side, according to Takata. That requires the use of powerful and potentially dangerous explosives in inflators which require careful handling and precise calibration.In March 2006, Takata’s air bag plant in Monclova was rocked by a series of explosions that sent a fireball into the air.Takata uses ammonium nitrate in its inflators, Honda has said. That explosive compound is volatile and highly sensitive to moisture. Other air bag makers, including Takata’s larger Swedish rival, Autoliv Inc, have kept their inflator designs a proprietary secret.Takata identified several manufacturing problems with its inflators, including some at a plant in Moses Lake, Washington, and at Monclova, where the ammonium nitrate was exposed to too much moisture inside the air-conditioned plant.The manufacturing glitches meant the inflator propellant could burn too fast and blow apart the metal casing surrounding it, sending out hot gas and shrapnel.The recalls have been most costly for Honda. In May 2009, 18-year-old Ashley Parham was driving a 2001 Honda Accord when she bumped into a car in her high school parking lot outside Oklahoma City. The Accord’s air bag exploded and metal shrapnel sliced Parham’s carotid artery. She bled to death, one of two deaths linked to Takata air bags. Honda and Takata settled with Parham’s family out of court and details were not disclosed.Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategies and a witness for plaintiffs�� lawyers, said it was clear past Takata recalls, which began in 2008, had fallen short.“What’s very troubling is that they haven’t resolved this thing once and for all,�� he said.In Japan, drivers who began to respond to recall notices this week were sent home from Toyota dealerships with a yellow warning labels on the window visor.“Warning: Passenger Air Bag Inoperative,�� the warning reads. “We recommend you sit in the back seat. If you must sit in the front seat, push it all the way back and use a seatbelt.”Tomoki Nakagawa, 52, said he was stunned to find his mechanic had turned off the passenger air bag on his silver Noah minivan. He was told to avoid carrying passengers, advice that puzzled and frustrated him.“I bought a minivan because I need to carry many people. If there is an accident and the injury gets more serious because there was no air bag, how is Toyota going to respond?�� he said.Toyota took the step of disabling passenger-side air bags after consulting with Japan’s transport ministry, which approved the action. The automaker has told regulators it expects to have replacement parts available around September.“We temporarily suspended the air bag function on vehicles in Japan until the parts are available because (the ministry) requires a remedy at the time of recall filing,�� Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said. “We considered the lead time of remedy parts preparation, and we prioritized the customer’s safety.��	1.885343798
* Nissan sales up 22.2 pct, Honda up 22 pct* Toyota up 23.5 pct* Figures skewed by Chinese New Year holiday* Impact of anti-Japan protests has been on the wane (Adds graphics on Japanese carmakers�� Jan China sales)Feb 4 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd and other Japanese carmakers saw their China car sales improve in January but figures were skewed due to weak holiday-hit sales a year earlier and questions still hang over progress made since anti-Japan protests last year.Showroom traffic in the world’s largest auto market slows dramatically during China’s Lunar New Year holiday, a week-long break that fell in January last year but starts on Feb. 9 this year.That calendar mismatch helped Nissan and Honda Motor Co join Toyota Motor Corp in reporting double-digit climbs in January sales, the first rise since a territorial row over islands in the East China Sea sent sales tumbling in September.Nissan said sales jumped 22.2 percent in January to 115,700 vehicles, while Honda’s increased 22 percent. Toyota, which reported on Friday, logged a 23.5 percent rise.Even without the calendar impact, though, the effect of the territorial row has waned, with the pace of declines in December much less than drops of almost half seen in September and October, helped by generous incentives.“Given the difference in the number of working days between this year and last due to the Spring Festival, there is a need to compare the January-February figure. That said, we think the situation is improving compared with a month ago,�� Nissan said in an emailed statement.A Toyota executive said last month that showroom traffic in China was recovering to levels seen before the crisis and at a pace faster than expected.Other automakers have been more downbeat, with Mazda’s China Chief Noriaki Yamada saying in November that he expected first-quarter sales to slide by about a fifth from year-earlier levels but that the impact of the row should fade by the end of March.After years of breakneck expansion, China vehicles sales have lost some steam, climbing 4.3 percent to 19.3 million in 2012. This year, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers estimates growth of 7 percent. (Reporting by Fang Yan in BEIJING and Kazunori Takada in SHANGHAI; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)	4.450738418
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts maker Denso Corp 6902.T said on Thursday it has slashed global production by around 50% due to the coronavirus, adding its supply chain could be affected in the coming months if the outbreak is prolonged.Earlier in the day, the world's fourth-biggest components producer and a key supplier to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T posted an 81% drop in operating profit for the year ended March at 61 billion yen ($571.8 million), its lowest since 2009. But Denso retained its annual dividend of 140 yen per share.Tumbling profits at Denso and other suppliers are a reflection of plummeting demand for cars as people have been ordered to stay indoors in many countries to control the spread of the coronavirus, leaving motorways deserted and causing deep uncertainty about the longer-term impact on the global economy.“It will take considerable time for economies to recover to pre-coronavirus levels,�� Chief Executive Koji Arima told a live-streamed media briefing.“This will be a long-term battle... The industry is fighting for its survival.”The impact of the virus also weighed on fellow Toyota group supplier Aisin Seiki Co 7259.T which on Thursday posted a 73% drop in full-year operating profit to a decade-low of 56.1 billion yen, and cut its annual dividend to 120 yen per share, down from 150 yen last year.Toyota holds a nearly one-quarter stake in both Denso and Aisin.Denso said that as of April, global production was down by roughly half, largely due to production stoppages at plants in North America, Europe and Asia, brought about by a fall in demand as automakers stopped output due to the virus.The firm said it did not see any major bottlenecks in its supply chain, but that it could have problems procuring parts if plant closures continued into June and beyond.Denso, which specialises in vehicle air conditioning, powertrain and automated driving systems, declined to issue a financial forecast for the current final year, citing uncertainty about the lasting impact of the coronavirus.The company, which counts on Toyota for nearly half of its revenue, said it suffered a 43 billion yen hit due to the coronavirus in the year ended March, while it took a 222 billion yen hit due to increased product recall-related costs.Shares of both Denso and Aisin rose 6.5% on Thursday afternoon, in a strong broader market .N225 that gained 2.9%. Global vehicle sales by Japanese automakers dropped 34% in March when the coronavirus spread worldwide, showed Reuters calculations based on automakers�� sales figures, and are set to fall further as the crisis continues.Analysts expect this will put consumers off buying new cars, cutting 2020 global vehicle sales forecasts by around a third. That would compare with an 11% fall in vehicle sales after the 2008-09 global financial crisis.	2.314103083
PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech car production fell by 32.6% in the first half of this year to 503,615 cars as the new coronavirus pandemic hit the sector, Czech Automotive Industry Association (AIA) said on Monday.In June alone, production dropped 17.1% to 103,934 cars, as car makers returned to more standard operations after full closures earlier in the spring.Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto maintained its top position with 337,580 cars made in the first half of the year, followed by Hyundai with 96,390 cars and PSA-Toyota’s joint plant TPCA with 69,645 cars.(This story corrects June drop percentage in second paragraph to 17.1 from 7.1)	6.193078324
"TOKYO/DETROIT (Reuters) - Are electric cars running out of juice again?Recent moves by Japan’s two largest automakers suggest that the electric car, after more than 100 years of development and several brief revivals, still is not ready for prime time - and may never be.In the meantime, the attention of automotive executives in Asia, Europe and North America is beginning to swing toward an unusual but promising new alternate power source: hydrogen.The reality is that consumers continue to show little interest in electric vehicles, or EVs, which dominated U.S. streets in the first decade of the 20th century before being displaced by gasoline-powered cars.Despite the promise of ""green"" transportation - and despite billions of dollars in investment, most recently by Nissan Motor Co 7201.T - EVs continue to be plagued by many of the problems that eventually scuttled electrics in the 1910s and more recently in the 1990s. Those include high cost, short driving range and lack of charging stations.The public’s lack of appetite for battery-powered cars persuaded the Obama administration last week to back away from its aggressive goal to put 1 million electric cars on U.S. roads by 2015.The tepid response to EVs also pushed Nissan’s high-profile chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, perhaps the industry’s most outspoken proponent of battery cars, to announce in December a major strategic shift toward more mainstream gasoline-electric hybrids, which overcome many of the shortcomings of pure EVs.The move was widely seen as a tacit acknowledgement by Ghosn that his all-or-nothing, multibillion-dollar bet on EVs is falling far short of his ambition to sell hundreds of thousands of battery-powered Nissan Leafs.Instead, Nissan plans to follow rival Toyota Motor Co 7203.T, the world's largest purveyor of hybrids, which now is poised to leapfrog pure EVs altogether to pursue what might be the next big green-tech breakthrough: pollution- and petroleum-free fuel-cell cars that convert hydrogen to electricity.Vice Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, the “father of the Prius�� who helped put hybrids on the map, said he believes fuel-cell vehicles hold far more promise than battery electric cars.“Because of its shortcomings - driving range, cost and recharging time - the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars,�� said Uchiyamada. “We need something entirely new.”In the race to identify the Next Big Thing in automotive technology, the stakes are enormous.For example, Nissan, with French partner Renault RENA.PA, has committed $5 billion for development and manufacture of EVs and batteries - a risky bet that could take years to pay off - while Toyota has spent an estimated $10 billion or more over the past 16 years to develop, build and market an ever-expanding range of hybrids, led by the popular and now profitable Prius.While neither Nissan nor Toyota is likely to pull the plug on electric cars, it is clear from their recent moves that both companies are looking beyond EVs to meet future transportation needs.Both automakers began advanced green-car engineering programs in the mid-1990s, with Toyota introducing the first-generation Prius hybrid and Nissan unveiling the battery-powered Altra in late 1997.Toyota brought the Prius to the United States in 2000, but it took Nissan another 10 years to follow the low-volume Altra and other modest electric-car projects such as the Hypermini with the handsomely funded 2010 launch of the Leaf.With Uchiyamada overseeing continuous refinement of the Prius, Toyota took a 10-year lead in the green-car derby. Along the way, though, Toyota effectively subsidized billions of dollars in development, manufacturing and marketing costs through the first two generations of the Prius, according to former Toyota executives.While it took the Toyota hybrid six years to catch fire with U.S. consumers, the latest sales data points to the widening chasm between the two companies�� radically different approaches to electrification.In the past year, Toyota has broadened its hybrid portfolio to 12 models, including four versions of the Prius, now in its third generation. Toyota in 2012 sold 327,413 hybrids in the United States and 1.2 million globally. Worldwide sales of its hybrids now approach 5 million.The Prius accounts for more than half of those sales, making it the most successful green car in history and one of the few exceptions to the public’s yawning indifference to green vehicles and technology.The Leaf, on the other hand, has been the rule rather than the exception.Nissan unveiled the Leaf two years ago and to date has sold just under 50,000 worldwide. It sold 9,819 last year in the United States, well under its target of 20,000.As part of a year-end sales push, Nissan slapped incentives of almost $6,000 on the Leaf, and in January slashed the starting price by more than $6,000, to $29,650. Some Nissan dealers in Los Angeles are advertising Leaf lease rates as low as $199 a month with $1,999 down, according to industry research firm TrueCar.“When new technologies are launched, sales do not grow as quickly as everyone expects,�� said Mitsuhiko Yamashita, Nissan executive vice president and head of research and development. But “with EV technologies continuously improving and with prices falling, there is a possibility that sales could explode.”That isn’t likely to happen anytime soon.Nissan may be mildly encouraged that the Leaf is the best-selling pure EV in the United States. But total EV sales last year were only 14,687, representing 0.1 percent of total U.S. sales of 14.5 million. In comparison, hybrid sales in 2012 climbed to 473,083, or roughly 3.3 percent of the market. And of every three hybrids sold last year in the United States, two were a Toyota or a Lexus.Fueled by government subsidies and tax incentives, hybrid sales in Japan have rocketed to 40 percent of the industry total, with the Prius a top seller. Hybrids, however, have been far less popular with consumers in such major markets as Europe and China.“WE ARE PRAGMATIC PEOPLE”The outlook for pure electric vehicles is even more cloudy.At the moment, Ghosn’s heady 2009 prediction that electric vehicles would capture 10 percent of the global market by 2020 - 6 million battery-powered cars a year or more - doesn’t seem remotely within reach.Yet the gradual tightening of global fuel-efficiency standards from 2020 on is forcing automakers to assess their options, including the application of advanced technology.Says Nissan’s Yamashita: “It is not possible to meet (future) regulations unless vehicles are electrified.”The harsh reality of the market and the public’s underwhelming demand for EVs, however, illuminate Nissan’s recent decision to shift more of its green-tech investment into hybrids.In December the company announced it plans to introduce 15 new hybrids globally by early 2017.At the time, Ghosn said, “We are going to continue to heavily promote electric cars, but at the same time, we are business people, we are pragmatic people. We will also develop and deliver hybrids because there are markets and consumers that require hybrids.”Last September, Toyota publicly walked away from plans to build several thousand electric cars, scaling back projected volume to a mere 100 battery-powered minicars.Both Japanese automakers, meanwhile, have forged new alliances to develop hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars, Toyota with BMW and, in a deal announced last week, Nissan with Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and Ford Motor Co F.N.In the meantime, despite massive investments in battery technology and vehicles, even the most ardent EV adherents seem a bit ambivalent about the future of battery cars.“We don’t regret it yet,�� says Nissan’s Yamashita of the company’s multibillion-dollar gamble on EVs. “We might in a few years. No, we probably won’t.�� (Additional reporting by Paul Ingrassia in New York, Laurence Frost in Paris, Deepa Seetharaman and Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Martin Howell and Douglas Royalty)"	4.450738418
* Sales up 32 percent in May, 31 pct in Jan-May* Outperforms Toyota in May, overall market in Jan-April* Surge due to stream of new models -Honda spokeswoman (Adds new models, industry comparison, context)BEIJING, June 2 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd booked a 32 percent surge in China sales in May as it continued to benefit from new models in a slowing market where the Japanese automaker has been out-selling rivals.New versions of the Vezel crossover and Fit sub-compact launched last year helped January-May sales rise 31 percent, compared with just 4.4 percent at compatriot Toyota Motor Corp .Honda’s sales were similarly up 31 percent in January-April versus 7.7 percent for the overall passenger vehicle market, according to the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers, which has yet to report May data.The upbeat figures contrast with a wave of recall headlines as quality issues plague the automaker elsewhere in the world.Honda forecast flat profit for the year started April due to the cost of recalling vehicles with suspected faulty air bag parts from Takata Corp, taking its global recall to 20 million since 2008.A Honda spokeswoman on Tuesday said a steady stream of new models pushed up sales in China, with the Vezel - launched in October - accounting for one in eight Honda-brand cars sold in the country in May.Other models launched last year also enjoyed healthy sales with the Fit rising 350 percent in the year through May and Odyssey multi-purpose up 171 percent.Honda plans to launch five more new or updated models this year, the spokeswoman said.Honda makes cars in China through joint ventures with Dongfeng Motor Group Co and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co .

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party began gathering for its annual conference on Saturday with bitter divisions over her Brexit plans rising to the fore, raising doubts about her own future.Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, but the terms of the departure remain unclear. May, under fire from critics in Brussels, opponents at home and some lawmakers in her own party, has said talks on a divorce deal are at an impasse.In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper ahead of her party’s conference, May took aim at those who have scorned her “Chequers�� Brexit proposals accusing them of “playing politics�� with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest.However, in a demonstration of the challenge she faces, the newspaper ran an interview with former foreign minister Boris Johnson alongside on its front page in which he openly questioned May’s commitment to Brexit and called her plans “deranged.”�Unlike the prime minister I campaigned for Brexit,�� said Johnson, the bookmakers�� favourite to succeed May who on Friday declined to answer directly whether he would rule out a leadership challenge.“Unlike the prime minister I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.”May says her “Chequers�� proposals are the only viable option, but EU leaders have said parts of them are unacceptable and many Conservative lawmakers have threatened to vote down a deal based on May’s blueprint.The uncertainty has led to business concerns that there will be no deal, potentially leading to tariffs and border delays.Japanese carmaker Toyota 7203.T on Saturday warned that leaving without an agreement would hit its production and jobs would ultimately be at risk.“Of course we want a deal,�� Business Secretary Greg Clark, one of those who supports May’s plans which seeks free trade of goods with the EU, told BBC radio.“We need to have a deal. The evidence from not just Toyota and other manufacturers is we need absolutely to be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”A summit of EU leaders last week ended in a blunt dismissal of May’s proposals, which they said would fail to resolve arguments over the land border of Northern Ireland, in the UK, with the Irish Republic, in the EU, one of the main sticking points to a deal.Britain’s Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Irish issue was being used by some in the EU Commission “for political purposes��, but said he was open to suggestions from the bloc.“We aren’t pretending there aren’t alternative proposals that we would look at,�� he told the Sun newspaper. “But we need credible responses for the proposals we have set out or credible alternatives, and we haven’t seen them yet.”As Conservative lawmakers and party members began arriving in Birmingham, central England, for what is expected to be a fractious party conference which starts on Sunday, many have said the Chequers plans are dead and should be torn up.While May and government ministers continue to express confidence that a final Brexit deal can be agreed, they have also insisted no-deal would be better than a bad deal.However, Toyota became the latest high-profile business to warn that leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without any trading agreement could add costs and cripple output at plants which rely on the just-in-time delivery of tens of thousands of components.“If we crash out of the EU at the end of March the supply chain will be impacted and we will see production stops in our factory,�� said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota’s Burnaston plant, which produced 144,000 vehicles last year.Earlier this week other carmakers in Britain including BMW, McLaren and Honda said they had triggered some contingency plans, such as certifying models in the EU, redrawing production schedules and stockpiling parts.“The additional burden of import and export cost would add permanent costs to our business,�� Toyota’s Cooke said. “It would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly I think that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs.��	-6.873898414
* New framework would cut costs by sharing more parts* Toyota to give more clout to chief engineers* Toyota to slash members for design review* New platform to have lower centre of gravityBy Chang-Ran KimTOYOTA CITY, Japan, April 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp unveiled on Monday a new framework for vehicle development aimed at making its cars more appealing, while cutting costs by at least 30 percent through the use of more shared parts.Since taking the helm three years ago, Chief Executive Akio Toyoda has sought to steer Toyota’s focus back to making better products, blaming unchecked sales growth in the run-up to the financial crisis for its penchant for building popular but unexciting cars.“The feeling at the time was, ‘If we build it, they will come,’� Toyoda told reporters at the automaker’s headquarters in central Japan. “Instead of developing what customers would want next, we were making cars that would rake in sales.”Under the new framework, dubbed Toyota New Global Architecture, or TNGA, Toyota will develop multiple models simultaneously to boost the number of common parts. That would help lower costs and free up resources that could be shifted to pursuing varying regional needs, Toyota said.The company will also give greater authority to chief engineers and slash the number of executives involved in the design review process -- about 80 to 100 previously -- to eliminate layers of decision-making.“Toyota’s problem was that it had too many filters,�� said Tokuo Fukuichi, who took the chief designer post last year. “When you have that many people weighing in, you end up developing cars by eliminating the negatives, not by creating something positive, by taking risks.”Toyota’s initiative to spice up its cars comes as rivals catch up in quality and fuel efficiency, leaving styling and vehicle appeal as increasingly important factors to attract customers. The arrival of South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp, with their aggressively styled and features-packed cars, has especially forced more established brands to step up their game.The temptation of sticking to a proven design has also ailed Honda Motor Co, whose chief executive has made similar structural changes in the last year to speed up decision-making and encourage more risk-taking.Toyota said it would initiate TNGA with three front-wheel-drive vehicle platforms, which would cover about half of the cars it produces.Greater cooperation between the planning and design divisions will allow more design freedom, and new platforms will feature a lower centre of gravity that would improve styling and vehicle handling, Toyota said. The NS4 plug-in hybrid concept, showcased at the Detroit auto show in January, gives the first hint of that design, Toyota said.	-1.494934519
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's standards agency said on Wednesday it had been informed about the recall of 20,702 Toyota 7203.T cars sold between March 2010 and May 2015.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s trade minister is worried about Japan’s falling levels of direct investment in his country, Japanese business officials who met him said on Tuesday, against a backdrop of strained ties between the world’s second- and third-biggest economies.Japan’s direct investment in China fell nearly a fifth in 2013, and dropped another 40 percent to 300.8 billion yen ($2.8 billion) during the first half of 2014 from a year earlier.The delegates, who spoke to reporters after meeting Trade Minister Gao Hucheng, were among some 200 Japanese business association officials led by Toyota Motor Corp.'s 7203.T honorary chairman, Fujio Cho.Their visit comes amid a slew of anti-trust probes by China's price watchdogs, which have attributed anti-competitive behavior to Japanese auto parts producers, among other companies, such as Microsoft Corp. MSFT.O and chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. QCOM.O. In August, pricing regulator the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices as the government stepped up enforcement of an anti-trust law targeting major firms.Gao told the delegates China did not want the chilly political relationship to slow economic activities, an association official who attended the meeting said.The official asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.The delegation is likely to meet Vice Premier Wang Yang on Wednesday, association officials said, after its hopes of meeting President Xi Jinping or Premier Li Keqiang proved unlikely.China has consistently blamed fraying bilateral ties on Japan, even as the leadership has called for Asia’s two biggest economic powers to continue economic cooperation.Tension between the two has been fueled by a continuing row over a small chain of disputed islets in the East China Sea, known in China as the Diaoyu and in Japan as the Senkaku.The NDRC summoned executives of Japanese carmaker Toyota this month over pricing policies and practices for spare and replacement parts at its luxury Lexus division, people with direct knowledge of the matter have said.The questioning coincided with the first-ever punishments of foreign automakers for price-fixing, when fines were imposed on the Chinese venture of Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and the China sales unit of Fiat's Chrysler FIA.MI. The slew of antitrust investigations has prompted complaints from foreign officials and the business community that foreign firms are being unfairly targeted.	-3.651661759
FRANKFURT, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Carmakers are reducing staff attending Geneva’s car show next week as Switzerland confirmed three new cases of the coronavirus, including one in Geneva.Toyota on Thursday said it is paring back its attendance to include “business critical�� staff. Only senior executives and public relations staff with pan-European responsibilities will attend, while staff who represent only national markets will stay behind, it said.Palexpo, the organiser of the international exhibition, insisted that the car show will go ahead even as the Geneva watch fair was cancelled and as Swiss authorities reported the virus had spread to Geneva.Travel restrictions and fears over the spread of the virus have already caused postponement or cancellation of other trade fairs, including the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Frankfurt’s Light + Building fair and the Beijing Auto Show.Shanghai-based AIWAYS late on Wednesday said it had been unable to ship its electric U6ion coupe from China to Switzerland, citing “circumstances beyond our control�� related to the coronavirus.On Wednesday it emerged that the chief executives of Ferrari and brake manufacturer Brembo had cancelled their attendance at the Swiss car show, owing to travel restrictions imposed by Italian authorities.	-4.229445507
(Reuters) - Two teenagers, first categorized as missing in Canada, are now suspects in the murder of an Australian tourist, his American girlfriend and an unidentified man whose body was found near the teens�� abandoned, flaming car, police said on Tuesday.Lucas Fowler, 23, an Australian citizen, and Chynna Deese, 24, from Charlotte, North Carolina, were found shot dead on July 15 on a highway in northern British Columbia, 20 km (12 miles) from Liard Hot Springs.Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, have been missing since July 19. Their car was found in flames about 500 km (310 miles) away from where Fowler and Deese were found dead, near Dease Lake, British Columbia.The body of a man the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are still trying to identify was found 2 km (1.2 miles) from the abandoned car. It was not immediately clear to police whether the body was connected to the car and the missing teenagers, but the RCMP said they are now also considering McLeod and Schmegelsky as suspects in the man’s murder.McLeod and Schmegelsky were last seen in northern Saskatchewan, driving a gray 2011 Toyota RAV4, the RCMP said.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) was interviewing Deese’s mother, Sheila, when police announced that the teenagers were suspects and warned the public not to approach them, instead saying to call 911.“I need for anyone with information to share that, because this can’t happen to another family,�� the mother was quoted as saying.“It shouldn’t have happened to ours.”Police have cited the vastness of the area in question, as well as its remoteness, as factors complicating their investigation.It is not known if McLeod and Schmegelsky are armed, or what their motives may be. The ABC said Deese was due home on July 31, with the day marked “Chynna returns�� in the calendar by the kitchen at the family’s North Carolina home.“I don’t know what I’m going to do on July 31,�� Sheila told the network. “Chynna was a sunflower.

The jobless rate fell to 7.4 percent.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 ended at record highs for a second day on Friday, posting modest gains despite the mixed employment report.The dollar’s retreat against the yen could weigh on market sentiment, said Toyo’s Hiwada.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Tuesday said it sees room to expand in China as growing sales of its luxury brand Lexus help it buck an emerging trend of slowing demand which has hit profit at some of its global rivals.Japan’s biggest automaker also raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 4.3 percent, saying improved marketing pushed up sales in China, Europe and elsewhere, while a weaker yen will have a bigger positive impact.Growing demand for Toyota’s Lexus luxury brand has boosted China sales in the past year. Import tariff cuts from July have also supported Lexus models, which are shipped from Japan - though Toyota is considering producing them locally, Reuters reported last month.That demand has helped the automaker weather the market’s steepest sales drop in nearly seven years in September amid a broader slowdown in economic growth.“Even if there is uncertainty in China, potentially the market will grow in the longer term,�� Didier Leroy, Toyota’s chief competitive officer, said at briefing.“Lexus is growing in China but if you compare it with other brands we still have a small brand ... That means that we have a lot of room to improve and Lexus has strong potential in China.”Toyota sold about 1.3 million vehicles in China in 2017 and has a market share of 5 percent, much smaller than General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE. Leroy said region-specific marketing and a diverse product offering has helped Toyota sales, which jumped 20 percent in July-September.Toyota now expects full-year profit of 2.4 trillion yen ($21.18 billion) - flat versus the year prior - based on the yen averaging around 110 yen to the U.S. dollar JPY= through March rather than 106 yen in its previous forecast.The upgrade comes after a 1.9 percent rise in global sales in July-September helped operating profit rise 11 percent to mark Toyota’s strongest second-quarter performance since 2015.Higher sales in China helped lift Asia sales by 9.2 percent, while sales rose 4.8 percent in Europe.

BONN, Germany, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Increasing the use of hydrogen in power, transport, heat and industry could deliver around one fifth of the total carbon emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to safe levels by mid-century, a report by the Hydrogen Council said on Monday.In an effort to encourage other industries to use hydrogen, Toyota and Air Liquide helped set up the Hydrogen Council, a global lobby launched in January this year.Its 27 members include automakers Audi, BMW , Daimler, Honda, Hyundai , and energy companies such as Shell and Total.In a report released on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference in Bonn, the council said the use of hydrogen across sectors such as transport, energy generation, energy storage, industry, heat and power could reduce annual carbon emissions by 6 billion tonnes by 2050.“This would ... contribute roughly 20 percent of the additional abatement required to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius,�� the report said.To achieve a two-degree limit this century agreed by governments in Paris in 2015, the world needs to make reduce energy-related carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2050.In the transport sector alone, the report said one in 12 cars sold in California, Germany and Japan should be powered by hydrogen by 2030.By 2050, hydrogen could power 400 million cars, 15-20 million trucks, around 5 million buses, a quarter of passenger ships and a fifth of non-electrified train tracks, as well as some airplanes and freight ships.However, combined with other sectors, achieving this would require investment of $280 billion by 2030. Around $110 billion of this would be needed to finance hydrogen production; $80 billion for storage, transport and distribution and $70 billion in product development.So far the take-up of hydrogen vehicles is tiny and industry experts say their wider use is years away at best, with high purchase prices and a lack of refuelling stations the major barriers.Yet some companies, such as miner Anglo American and carmaker Toyota, are swimming against the tide and pushing for fuel cell cars to fill a role in a future dominated by electric battery vehicles.Some countries, too, have set targets for hydrogen use, such as China, which aims to have 1 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2030 and Britain which has a 23 million pound ($30 million) fund to accelerate the take-up of hydrogen vehicles.The council believes that with the right policies, the huge investment needed is “feasible�� and the hydrogen market could see revenues of more than $2.5 trillion a year.“The world already invests more than $1.7 trillion in energy each year, including $650 billion in oil and gas, $300 billion in renewable electricity, and more than $300 billion in the automotive industry,�� it said.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - A fast-spreading coronavirus in China has sent shockwaves through global commodity markets, prompting OPEC and its allies to consider deepening crude supply curbs and Asia’s largest oil refiner to slash over a tenth of its output.The new virus has already killed 361 people in China and spread to over around two dozen other countries.The number of confirmed cases in China has risen above 17,000 with at least another 151 confirmed cases in other countries and regions.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are in discussion to bring forward a policy meeting to this month from March, and to consider deepening oil supply curbs by an additional 500,000 barrels per day to 2.2 million bpd.OPEC member Iran said the spread of the virus had hit oil demand and called for an effort to stabilize prices, Iran’s official news agency IRNA reported.China is the second-largest oil refiner and a critical growth engine for the global economy, so any material contraction in Chinese economic activity is expected to have far-reaching repercussions across several industries.China’s Sinopec Corp, Asia’s largest refiner, is cutting throughput this month by 600,000 bpd, around 12%, its steepest cut in over a decade, in response to slowing oil demand.Sinopec’s trading arm Unipec has suspended purchases of West African crude and is looking to re-sell at least five of its March-loading Angolan cargoes.Analysts predict China’s oil demand could fall by 250,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2020 with jet fuel taking the hardest hit as international airlines shun the country due to the virus.Jet fuel prices and production margins in Asia posted their biggest monthly decline in more than a decade in January, hurting refiners and fuel exporters.Dozens of international carriers have already fully or partly suspended flights to China, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets.Freight rates for supertankers on the Mideast Gulf and U.S. Gulf routes to Asia have fallen to their lowest since mid-September.Oil prices have fallen to their lowest since last January, dragged down by concerns about demand in China - the world’s top oil importer.Palm oil prices steadied on Monday after two straight sessions of losses, but brokers and traders told Reuters prices could fall below 2,500 ringgit over coming weeks if the spread of the coronavirus continues to disrupt travel and normal activity in the world’s second-largest palm oil importer.Palm oil is used mainly in food courts and by catering companies in China, the second-largest palm importer behind India, so reduced consumption is expected over the near to medium term.(Graphic: Commodities prices under pressure as China grapples with the coronavirus,Base metals have also taken a hit as Chinese manufacturing plants and factories take protracted Lunar New Year breaks while they assess the fallout from the virus.

But it is also thanks to an offer of six free engine oil changes, worth around 3,000 yuan ($420), for customers who buy models such as the Binyue sport utility vehicle.“Although car retail prices are not much different from usual, customers get to enjoy these complimentary services that do not impact our budget much in the short term,�� he said.In the nearby city of Ningbo, a Toyota Motor Corp dealership offering 10 free oil changes saw April vehicle sales return to pre-virus levels and is aiming for sales in May to climb 10% month-on-month, its marketing manager Chen Xiaotian told Reuters.Even some luxury brands were offering deals, with one Lexus store in Hangzhou enticing customers with thousands of yuan in cashbacks.Visits and phone calls by Reuters to dozens of dealerships in the world’s biggest auto market showed most have notched up double-digit percentage jumps in unit sales for April compared to March and many expect May sales to grow at least another 10%.Their efforts helped China log its first positive growth in vehicle sales in nearly two years, up 4.4% in April from the same month a year earlier.But the industry remains deeply worried. Any momentum from demand that was locked up in February and March is expected to peter out by the end of May. After that, the outlook for consumer spending is bleak as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hammer the global economy, including China’s exports.Moreover, industry executives believe the generous deals currently being offered to customers are priming the market for a return to price wars.Feng Xingya, general manager of state-owned automaker GAC which has partnerships with Toyota and Honda Motor Co, believes a bruising price war is on the cards.“When there is not much demand amid a pickup in production, price competition will obviously increase,�� he told an investor conference in April, adding GAC “cannot be afraid of or refuse to enter any price war.”Slipping back into price war mode would be easy enough in a crowded market where pandemic-hit automakers are desperate to gain what sales they can.The industry has already been there twice in the recent past. In 2018, sticker prices took a hit as China’s auto market began to weaken after two decades of strong growth while in mid-2019, dealers offered big incentives after the chaotic implementation of new emissions standards.“Offering gifts and cashbacks suggests a lack of substantial customer demand,�� said Alan Kang, a senior LMC Automotive analyst, adding more brands could offer incentives across more segments to maintain market share.Kang believes China auto sales will be either flat or show slight growth in the second half of this year.Dealers noted customers had recently become far more price sensitive.“We are repeatedly asked by customers about whether Hangzhou will roll out policies to support car demand such as subsidies,�� said Avery Wu, marketing manager at a Hangzhou-based Volkswagen dealership.She added some customers were holding off on purchases in the belief that such subsidies will be forthcoming.	2.948996858
* Higher gasoline prices spur sales of compact cars* Honda sales rise 59.5 pct, Toyota up 46 pct* GM’s August sales rise 10 pct, Ford up 13 pct* VW has best U.S. August in 39 yearsBy Bernie Woodall and Deepa SeetharamanDETROIT, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Automakers turned in their best August since before the 2007-09 recession, with U.S. monthly auto sales rising 20 percent from a year ago as consumers with aging vehicles showed more confidence in buying big-ticket items on easier credit terms.Big sales gains were achieved by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, which continued to recover after last year’s earthquake and tsunami.All three Detroit automakers increased August sales more than analysts had expected.Total sales for the month were 1,285,202 vehicles, according to Autodata Corp, the highest monthly sales figure for any August since 2007, when 1.47 million autos were sold in the United States.“The reason for the improvement is that consumers are feeling better about making big-ticket item purchases,�� said Jesse Toprak, autos analyst with TrueCar.com.He also said that new models from Detroit and foreign automakers gave consumers “the best selection ever.”The auto sales pace last month was the latest sign suggesting consumer spending fared better early in the third quarter after weak consumption held back economic growth to a 1.7 percent annual pace from April through June.“The weaker consumer spending that we saw in the second quarter was solely related to slower car sales. So the pickup in car sales removes this weakness and it’s a good sign and bodes well for consumer spending in the summer,�� said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research.“The fact that Americans continue to buy cars is in line with our view that the fundamentals for faster consumer spending remain in place.”Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, also rose at a 1.7 percent pace in the second quarter.Toyota showed a sales increase of 46 percent, and Honda’s sales rose 59.5 percent.General Motors Co posted a 10 percent jump, as higher gasoline prices spurred sales of compact cars including GM’s Cruze. Average U.S. gasoline prices rose 21 cents a gallon in the past month.“Higher gas prices in August will lead to unseasonably strong small car performance across the industry,�� said Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell.On the seasonally adjusted annualized rate followed by the auto industry, August U.S. sales were 14.52 million vehicles, slightly more than the 14.5 million annualized rate for February of this year.Analysts polled by Reuters forecast an annualized sales rate of 14.2 million light vehicles.So far this year, the U.S. auto sales rate has been 14.3 million on an annualized basis, GM and Ford said. Those figures do not include medium and heavy trucks. That compares with 12.8 million for full-year 2011.GM’s sales gain of 10 percent last month surpassed expectations from five analysts of a gain between 2 and 6.4 percent.GM is No. 1 in the U.S. auto market by sales, followed by Ford, Toyota and Chrysler.Toyota’s August sales of 188,520 represented a 46 percent gain over last August, when sales were greatly pressured by a lack of inventory caused by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.Honda’s sales rose 59.5 percent to 131,321 vehicles, led by an 89 percent rise in sales of its top model, the Accord.Beau Boeckmann, vice president of Galpin Ford in Southern California, said sales at his dealership are up in part because consumers are finding it easier to obtain credit. Galpin is the largest Ford dealership in the world as measured in sales volume.“There’s been an overall opening up of credit to consumers,�� Boeckmann told Reuters on Tuesday. “A couple of years ago when you were talking with the banks, they tried to find a way to not buy the deal. There’s been a big attitude shift.”GM said sales rose to 240,520 vehicles. Ford’s U.S. August sales rose 13 percent to 197,249 vehicles, and Chrysler Group LLC posted a 14 percent rise in August.Chrysler sales were 148,472 vehicles, which the company said showed its best performance for August since 2007. Chrysler is managed and majority-owned by Italy’s Fiat SpA.GM shares ended 0.2 percent lower at $21.31 on Tuesday, and Ford shares were up 0.7 percent at $9.41. The broad S&amp;P 500 Index dipped 0.1 percent on the day.Volkswagen AG turned in its best August U.S. sales performance since 1973, said Carsten Krebs, head of communications for Volkswagen Group of America. The carmaker’s sales rose 62.5 percent to 41,011 vehicles last month.Overall, Volkswagen’s U.S. sales rose 48 percent, including sales of luxury brands Audi and Porsche. Audi’s sales rose 13 percent to 11,527 vehicles.Hyundai Motor Co’s U.S. sales rose only 4 percent in August, to 61,099 vehicles, as the South Korean automaker was limited by constraints on its supply. Its corporate sibling, Kia Motors Corp, reported its 24th straight month of record sales, up 21.5 percent at 50,028 vehicles.Caldwell of Edmunds.com pointed out that 17 percent of Kia’s new-car customers are financed at an interest rate of 10 percent, indicating that the brand is appealing to consumers with subprime credit.John Krafcik, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said via Twitter that the company will add a third shift to its Alabama plant in September which “will help us better meet demand.”Limited supply of Nissan Motor Co’s top-selling Altima midsize sedan helped cut in to that automaker’s monthly sales, which rose by a less-than-expected 7.6 percent.Nissan began selling the redesigned Altima in July, and August sales of that model were up 12.5 percent from a year ago. Still, “several thousand�� Altima sales were lost due to lack of inventory by some U.S. dealers, said head of the Nissan brand in North America, Al Castignetti.Toyota’s Lexus was the August sales leader among luxury brands, at 24,237 vehicles, beating Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz at 22,686 and BMW AG’s BMW brand at 16,835.Lexus was No. 1 in the U.S. luxury market for 11 straight years until last year, when its sales dropped in large part due to the Japanese earthquake. BMW was No. 1 last year and Mercedes-Benz second.For the year so far, Mercedes-Benz is the leading luxury brand at 182,098 in sales followed by BMW at 164,636 and Lexus at 150,604.Rising gasoline prices were a factor in consumers�� choice of vehicles in August, said Ken Czubay, Ford vice president of U.S. marketing.“As fuel prices rose again during August, we saw growing numbers of people gravitate toward our fuel-efficient vehicles,�� said Czubay.Still, sales of its Fiesta small car fell 28 percent in August. Meanwhile, Focus compact car sales rose 31.5 percent.Ford reported record sales for the Escape crossover and Fusion sedan, and said the F-Series pickup had its best sales month all year. Ford brand sales were up 13.1 percent, while Lincoln brand sales rose 1.7 percent.Chrysler said sales of its Dodge Dart compact sedan were 3,045 in August, as it rolled out the car to more U.S. dealerships.	-0.9433962264
TOKYO, April 15 (Reuters) - British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt reassured Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday that the British government was determined to avoid a no-deal exit from the European Union.“We recognize that Japan has many investments employing hundreds of thousands of people in the U.K. We want strong cooperation to continue,�� Hunt told Abe at the Japanese leader’s residence in Tokyo.Japan is one of Britain’s biggest foreign investors, building cars and other products in a country it has viewed as a gateway to the broader European market.Britain’s decision to leave the EU has raised concern in London that Japanese firms will shift operations elsewhere if tariff-free trade ends with the rest of the European bloc.Hunt is also visiting Toyota Motor Corp, which plans to build a new car model with Suzuki in Britain, during his trip to Japan.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday he signed a decree that lays out government support to build an electric vehicle (EV) industry in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, the Cabinet Secretariat said in a statement.Widodo did not elaborate, but a draft of the decree reviewed by Reuters ahead of the signing showed it contained a series of incentives to boost production and purchase of EVs.Widodo said in the statement that the key to the EV industry is in the construction of the batteries they run on and the “raw materials to make a battery: cobalt, manganese and others, we have in this country.”Resource-rich Indonesia has been seeking to carve out a downstream industry based on its supplies of nickel laterite ore, which is used in lithium batteries.“The business strategy can be designed in this country so that we can get ahead of others in building an inexpensive electric car industry, which is competitive because the raw materials are here,�� he said on the sideline of an event at the headquarters of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to the statement.Widodo warned that building such an industry would take longer than “a year or two��, because it must also create a new market.The draft regulation seen by Reuters gives automakers reductions in import tariffs for machinery and materials and lower luxury taxes for buyers, among other things.Widodo on Thursday also suggested that city administrations across the country could provide more incentives, such as free parking or free administrative fees, to further support adoption of EVs by private consumers and public transportation firms.Indonesia aims to become an EV hub for Asia and beyond with a target to start EV production in 2022 and for the share of EV output to reach 20% of total car production by 2025.Indonesian authorities said Toyota Motor Corp, which has the biggest market share in the domestic car market, and Hyundai Motor would invest $2 billion and $880 million in the country, respectively, to develop EVs over the next few years.	2.984958908
"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N, already locked in a public relations crisis because of a deadly ignition defect that has triggered the recall of 2.6 million vehicles, has a new perception problem on its hands.The U.S. company is now considered the worst big automaker to deal with, according to a new survey of top suppliers to the car industry in the United States.The annual survey, conducted by the automotive consultant group Planning Perspectives Inc, asks the industry’s biggest suppliers to rate their relationships with the six automakers that account for more than 85 percent of all light vehicle sales in the United States.Those so-called ""Tier 1"" suppliers say GM is now their least favorite big customer, according to the rankings, less popular even than Chrysler, the unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FIA.MI, which since 2008 had consistently earned that dubious distinction.Suppliers gave GM low marks on all kinds of key measures, including its overall trustworthiness, its communication skills, and its protection of intellectual property.The suppliers also said that GM was the automaker least likely to allow them to raise prices to recoup unexpected material cost increases.“As a result, GM is now the least preferred customer of suppliers,�� PPI says.Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T overtook Ford Motor Co F.N for third place in PPI's Supplier Working Relations Index, pushing Dearborn-based Ford into fourth place. Toyota Motor Co 7203.T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T finished in the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, respectively.PPI, which has been conducting the survey for 14 years, says supplier perceptions of automakers are critical because they can determine which car makers see the suppliers�� newest technologies first, get their best pricing and work with their best engineers.John Henke, the head of PPI and a research fellow at Center for Supply Chain Management at Rutgers University, said the Japanese sweep of the top three places suggested the industry “could be entering an era in supplier relations that doesn’t bode well for the U.S. Big Three.”The reason: the Japanese automakers are not just benefiting from a deterioration in relations between suppliers and the Big Three -- they are actually rising in the estimation of their suppliers.Toyota and Nissan, in particular, saw the percentage of suppliers who characterized their relationship with the two automakers as “good or very good�� surge.GM, meanwhile, is in an especially unenviable spot, with 55 percent of the suppliers surveyed characterizing their relations with the automaker as “poor to very poor,�� up from 48 percent last year.One bit of good news for GM. When the list of car makers was expanded to include the three German auto companies, which have a far less significant market share in the U.S., suppliers said Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE were even harder to deal with.But because BMW BMWG.DE ranked second in the expanded list, just below Toyota but ahead of Honda, GM's overall position fell to seventh place in the supplier's best/worst rankings."	4.440985258
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T President Akio Toyoda said on Thursday his company had increased its U.S. production in the past three decades, and that the Japanese brand should also be considered as a U.S. manufacturer.Toyoda’s comment comes as global automakers face pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has demanded that more cars sold in the United States be made locally to increase jobs and shrink the U.S. trade deficit.Trump singled out Toyota in a tweet last month, criticizing the plans by Japan’s biggest automaker to build a second plant in Mexico. Since then, Toyota has announced plans to invest $10 billion in its U.S. operations to increase production and create more jobs.“Things are very different in 2017 than they were in the 1980s. Today, we produce a large number of cars locally and we have developed a strong local supply chain,�� Toyoda told reporters at an event in Tokyo, referring to America.“We may be a Japanese brand ... but we’re also one of America’s car makers.”The United States is Toyota’s biggest market, and vehicle sales in the country comprise around one-quarter of the automaker’s global sales. It operates 10 manufacturing plants in the country, and locally produces around 56 percent of its vehicles sold there, according to calculations based on company data.Trump has focused on protectionist trade policies in his first weeks in office, formally withdrawing the United States from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade talks and has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Toyoda said his company would adapt to any “rule changes�� to the NAFTA trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada.Automotive trade will be high on the agenda when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits Trump in Washington next week.Toyoda denied media reports from earlier this week which said he would meet Abe on Friday ahead of the summit, saying that while he would like a meeting with the prime minister, it was still unclear whether one would take place due to scheduling issues.	-1.414476556
BANGKOK, July 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit said on Tuesday it expected the Thai automotive industry to achieve record sales of 1.2 million units in 2012, helped by government subsidies.Sales last year totalled 794,081 vehicles but President Kyoichi Tanada told a news conference the sector had returned to normal after devastating floods last October that forced many plants to close for months.As a result, Toyota expected its own sales to increase 65.5 percent this year to 480,000 units.Executive Vice-President Wichien Emprasertsuk said a Thai government subsidy for buyers of first cars had helped increase demand for its Yaris and Vios models, and may help account for 50 percent of total sales for the two.“The Thai automotive industry’s outlook next year will largely depend on whether the government will decide to continue its first-car tax subsidy or allow the reservation period to be extended,�� Wichien said.The finance ministry is reported to be seeking approval from the cabinet to extend the scheme to mid-2013 after manufacturers complained customers may not be able to receive their tax rebate due to backlogs causing delivery to be delayed beyond the eligible timeframe.“These factors will determine sales numbers next year,�� Wichien said.The car maker said it did not expect a major impact from the crisis in the euro zone as Europe only accounted for 3 percent of its exports from Thailand. Its main export market is the Middle East, followed by Asia and Oceania.	7.962866109
DETROIT, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Scion, Toyota Motor Corp’s sagging youth-oriented brand, will not be rejuvenated by fresh models on its U.S. showroom floors anytime soon, a top U.S. Toyota executive said on Thursday.Bob Carter, senior vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, said that while the company’s main Toyota brand is rolling out fresh products this year, the 1,000 U.S. Toyota dealers that also handle Scion will have to wait longer.“We have a very robust and very exciting product cadence coming for Scion, however, it’s further down the pipeline,�� Carter told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.Scion sales through August were down 1.6 percent from a year earlier. At this pace, this year’s Scion sales will be only about 40 percent of that of the brand’s peak year in 2006.Carter would not be specific on the timing of any new product for Scion, saying only that nothing new was coming in the next half year.Carter last month told U.S. Toyota dealers they could drop the Scion brand without penalty.While some analysts said that signaled the beginning of the end of the Scion brand at Toyota, Carter said that was not so.“We are absolutely committed to the brand as our youth strategy going into the future,�� Carter said.Still, he admitted that Scion sales are sagging, and told the dealers that with no new product coming soon, they could without any repercussions devote the showroom space to Toyota-branded products that they now use for Scion.Carter said none of the company’s dealers have said they will drop Scion.Toyota launched the Scion brand in 2003, and it is focused on the North American market.The age of Scion buyers is younger than for that of most other brands sold in the United States. Carter says the average age of a Scion buyer is 32, but Detroit-area research firm Polk, now a part of IHS Automotive, said that average age is 49 years.Tom Libbey of Polk said there are several ways to calculate the age of car buyers. He said Polk tallies from official vehicle registration data. Often, he said, the primary driver of a car may be younger than the person, such as a parent, who registers the vehicle.Scion U.S. sales were 73,505 last year, and its 2013 sales through August were a modest 48,959, which is on pace for less than 70,000 this year. Its peak year for U.S. sales was 2006, at 173,034, when the brand had only three models to sell.Through August, Scion accounted for only 0.3 percent of Toyota’s 1.53 million in U.S. sales, while the premium Lexus brand accounted for 11.1 percent and the Toyota brand 88.9 percent.Scion has five models. The best-selling one so far in 2013 has been the new FR-S sports coupe, which at 13,537 sold in the U.S. market is just slightly more than the tC sedan.The boxy hatchback compact xB is next at 12,740 in U.S. sales through August, followed by the xD hatchback subcompact at 6,257 sold and the iQ minicar has sold only 3,078 this year.Carter said he’s confident that Scion sales will rebound.“It’s just going to take us a little longer to see the growth,�� he said.While Carter would not talk specifically about future product, IHS Automotive has said that it expects an FR-S convertible to join the lineup next year, followed by a new xB in 2016 and a compact crossover in 2017.One of the main reasons Toyota dealers are hanging on to the Scion franchise is that nearly 75 percent of Scion customers are first-time buyers, said Carter, and when they buy a second vehicle, they stay with Scion or move up to Toyota or Lexus.	-0.1672640382

CHICAGO, March 31 (Reuters) - The credit rating for Bridgeview, Illinois, fell into the junk level on Friday after S&amp;P Global Ratings hit the Chicago suburb with a four-notch downgrade to BB-minus.S&amp;P cited debt pressures on Bridgeview, which issued $135 million of general obligation (GO) bonds in 2005 for a stadium that it owns and manages. “The downgrade reflects our view that the village will continue to face acute business, financial, and economic uncertainties related to its debt burden, particularly the debt issued for its Toyota Park stadium,�� S&amp;P analyst Blake Yocom said in a statement.S&amp;P placed the junk rating on a watch list for a possible further downgrade due to concerns over potentially reduced market access and weakened liquidity for Bridgeview.Village officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bridgeview is considering restructuring $24.5 million of variable-rate bonds to a fixed-rate mode with a 2047 maturity, according to S&amp;P.The credit rating agency said it expects Bridgeview, which has used restructurings in the past to ease debt service payments and minimize property tax hikes, to continue the practice, possibly pushing bond maturities out to years beyond the useful life of the stadium.It added that the “underperforming�� stadium has left the suburb with an “extremely high�� GO debt burden that totals about $256 million and “very weak�� liquidity.With seating for as many as 28,000, Toyota Park, which opened in 2006, hosts soccer games, concerts and other events in the village of 17,000 located southwest of Chicago.	-0.2027276078
DETROIT/TOKYO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - General Motors Co regained its title as the world’s top-selling automaker from Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp in 2011, but the U.S. company faces a challenge to stay on top this year as Toyota rebuilds its disaster-struck business.GM, bouncing back from bankruptcy less than three years ago, said on Thursday it sold 9.026 million vehicles globally last year, up 7.6 percent from 2010, with its Chevrolet brand setting a sales record of 4.76 million vehicles.The Detroit-based automaker’s return to the top slot comes after its 2009 taxpayer-funded bankruptcy restructuring allowed it to cut its spiralling legacy costs.It also comes as Toyota’s sales fell an estimated 6 percent in 2011 to 7.9 million vehicles, hit by severe production cuts following an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan and deadly floods in Thailand.The Japanese automaker is ramping up production to rebuild depleted inventory and will add output capacity in emerging markets such as Brazil and China this year. But analysts said it also faced stiffer competition as rivals step up their game.“Toyota’s biggest problem is that even without the natural disasters, its sales weren’t exactly growing,�� JP Morgan auto analyst Kohei Takahashi said.“The ranking is not that important, but they need a convincing strategy to boost their sales,�� he said, adding that Toyota was behind rivals such as Nissan Motor Co in rolling out small cars for emerging markets.Toyota has lagged the sharper sales growth at rivals such as Nissan and Hyundai Motor Co because of a relatively slow push into emerging markets as it scrambled to meet runaway demand in mature markets in the past decade.In a bid to catch up, Toyota is adding factories in Brazil, China, Thailand and elsewhere, aiming to sell half its cars in emerging markets by 2015, up from around 40 percent now.Toyota’s 2011 worldwide sales tally included listed subsidiaries Daihatsu Motors Co and Hino Motors Ltd , and it put the carmaker behind Volkswagen AG , which sold 8.16 million vehicles last year.It also just trailed the 8.03 million sold by Renault SA and partner Nissan, though this number includes the 638,000 cars sold by Russia’s AvtoVAZ, in which the French car maker owns a minority 25 percent.Excluding AvtoVAZ, Toyota remained ahead.Toyota gave no forecast for this year for the group, but said it expected parent-only sales to jump 20 percent to a record 8.48 million vehicles in 2012. Daihatsu and Hino sold around 850,000 vehicles combined in 2011.Toyota, due to publish its final sales tally for 2011 later this month, was once the envy of the auto industry.It has had a torrid couple of years: a quality crisis that triggered the recall of more than 10 million vehicles globally, a tarnished image and a subsequent slide in sales.Just as it was recovering from that, the March 11 quake and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeastern coastline, forcing it and other domestic automakers to scale back output for months. And in October, damage to suppliers from Thailand’s floods delivered a further setback to their recovery.On top of that, a strong yen is hurting profits on vehicles shipped from Japan and has prompted it to look at turning its North American operations into a big exporter.South Korean sister carmakers Hyundai Motor Co and its 34 percent owned Kia Motors Corp racked up total sales of 6.53 million last year.	16.55462185

BEIJING, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 85,600 automobiles in China in January, up 18.1 percent from a year earlier, the Japanese automaker said on Friday.That follows a 19.4 percent year-on-year jump in December and a 40.7 percent rise in November, which were partly boosted by a low base from last year when sales tumbled due to a surge in anti-Japan sentiment following a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.In 2013, Toyota sold about 917,500 vehicles in China, up 9.2 percent from a year earlier, beating its target of 900,000 vehicles, but slower than the overall market growth of 13.9 percent.A Toyota spokesman, Takanori Yokoi, said the company is aiming to sustain the momentum with key new and significantly redesigned models this year. It aims to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China this year, he said.The carmaker plans to manufacture some 10.3 million automobiles worldwide in 2014.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with China FAW Group Corp and Guangzhou Automobile Group.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is likely to make 120,000 more cars a year in the Chinese port city of Tianjin as part of a medium-term strategy that’s gathering pace as China-Japan ties improve, said four company insiders with knowledge of the matter.The Japanese auto maker’s plan to boost annual production capacity by about a quarter in the port city will lay the foundation to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, a jump of over 50 percent, the four sources said.The Tianjin expansion signals Toyota’s willingness to start adding significant manufacturing capacity in China with the possibility of one or two new assembly plants in the world’s biggest auto market, the sources said. Car imports could also increase, they said.The move comes at a time when China’s trade outlook with the United States appears fraught and uncertain.Toyota plans to significantly expand its sales networks and focus more on electric car technologies as part of the strategy, the sources said, declining to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.Toyota sold 1.29 million vehicles in China last year and while sales are projected at 1.4 million this year, “capacity constraints�� have restricted stronger growth, the sources said.Toyota’s manufacturing hub in Tianjin currently has the capacity to produce 510,000 vehicles a year, while Toyota as a whole, between two joint ventures, has overall capacity to churn out 1.16 million vehicles a year.(GRAPHIC: Auto sales in China: tmsnrt.rs/2vHLtzS)Manufacturing capacity numbers provided by automakers are called straight-time capacity without overtime. With overtime, a given assembly plant can produce 20 to 30 percent more than its capacity.According to two Tianjin government websites last week, Toyota has been given regulatory approval by the municipal government’s Development and Reform Commission to pursue its expansion.The two websites - including the official website for the Tianjin development district where Toyota’s production hub is based - said the Japanese automaker plans to expand its Tianjin base to be able to manufacture 10,000 all-electric battery cars and 110,000 so-called plug-in electric hybrids annually.It wasn’t immediately clear when Toyota will be able to start producing those additional cars.A Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment.The Tianjin facilities, which produces cars such as the Toyota Corolla and Vios cars, are owned and operated by one of Toyota’s joint ventures in China.The venture with FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] in Tianjin plans to invest 1.76 billion yuan ($257 million) for the expansion, according to the two Tianjin websites.China is sometimes a market difficult to operate for Japanese companies because of historical reasons.In 2012, cars sold by Toyota and other Japanese automakers were battered when protests erupted across China after diplomatic spats over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan.Since then, Toyota has emphasized steady growth rather than taking on risky expansion projects.According to the four sources, Toyota’s attitude toward China began changing markedly after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May.During the visit, Li toured Toyota’s facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, and was escorted by Toyota’s family scion and chief executive Akio Toyoda.Toyoda has since sought to boost his company’s presence in China, a vision that had culminated in an active effort to identify specific ways to do just that, according to the four sources.They said aside from boosting capacity, Toyota is also looking at the possibility to significantly expand its distribution networks for the mainstream Toyota and premium Lexus brands.It wasn’t immediately clear how significant a distribution network expansion Toyota is planning for both brands.Currently, Toyota has more than 1,300 stores for the Toyota brand and nearly 190 for its Lexus luxury cars.The timing for the China expansion couldn’t be better.Earlier this year, Toyota was able to finally launch a couple of much anticipated, potentially high-volume subcompact sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) - two China-market versions of the Toyota C-HR crossover SUV which hit showrooms in the United States last year.The C-HR variants are relatively small crossover SUVs that other manufacturers, most notably Japan’s Honda Motor Co, have leveraged to grow sales rapidly and sell more cars in China than its much bigger rival Toyota. Honda sold 1.44 million vehicles in China last year.Lexus is also deemed likely to benefit from a windfall from growing trade tensions between China and the United States.In retaliation for U.S. trade actions, China raised tariffs on automobiles imported from the United States in early July to 40 percent, which, among other things, has forced Tesla Inc, BMW, as well as Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz to raise prices on certain U.S.-built vehicles, such as the hot-selling BMW X5 and X6 crossover sport-utility vehicles.One likely consequence for those brands is a sales fall, a profit squeeze, or both.By contrast, all Lexus cars Toyota sells in China are brought in from Japan and benefit from a much lower tariff rate of 15 percent levied on non-U.S. produced car imports.	-0.2280873249
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to spend $1.1 billion to settle sweeping U.S. class-action litigation over claims that millions of its vehicles accelerate unintentionally, as the Japanese automaker seeks to move past the biggest safety crisis in its history.Shares of Toyota rose nearly 3 percent in Tokyo following the news, with some investors saying the settlement removed one uncertainty for the company and looked manageable given its improving sales outlook and a weaker yen.The proposed settlement will compensate customers for economic losses related to possible safety defects in Toyota vehicles, covering most of the litigation involving unintended acceleration, although it does not cover claims for wrongful death or injuries.About 16 million Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles sold in the United States spanning the model years 1998 to 2010 are covered by the action, according to court filings made public on Wednesday. Thirty nameplates are affected, including the top-selling Toyota Camry midsize sedan and Corolla compact car.Toyota, the No. 3 automaker in the U.S. market, admitted no fault in proposing the settlement, one of the largest of U.S. mass class-action litigation in the automotive sector.“This was a difficult decision, especially since reliable scientific evidence and multiple independent evaluations have confirmed the safety of Toyota’s electronic throttle control systems,�� Christopher Reynolds, general counsel for Toyota Motor Sales, USA, said in a statement.“However, we concluded that turning the page on this legacy legal issue through the positive steps we are taking is in the best interests of the company, our employees, our dealers and, most of all, our customers.”The figure eclipses other settlements in the auto industry including Bridgestone Corp’s $240 million payout to Ford Motor Co in 2005 over Ford’s massive Firestone tire safety recall in 2001. Ford replaced 13 million Firestone tires, installed mostly as original equipment on the company’s popular Explorer SUV, in one of the biggest recalls in U.S. history.Hagens Berman, the law firm representing Toyota owners who brought the lawsuit in 2010, issued a statement saying that the settlement was valued between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In a memo filed in court, the lawyers said the settlement was “a landmark, if not a record, settlement in automobile defect class action litigation in the United States.”Toyota said it would take a one-time pretax charge of $1.1 billion to cover the costs. The company said it planned to book the charge as operating expenses in its October-December third quarter.“This is positive, as it removes the factor that was the biggest concern when it came to lawsuits ... Because Toyota’s absolute numbers are very big when it comes to profits, it’s hardly going to have an impact,�� said Koji Endo, an autos analyst at Advanced Research in Tokyo.Toyota may be able to offset costs with a rise in its profits as the yen weakens, he added. Toyota’s operating profit increases by 35 billion yen for every one-yen rise in the value of the dollar. The automaker has forecast an operating profit of 1.05 trillion yen ($12.3 billion) for the financial year ending in March 2013.Toyota shares rose 2.7 percent, compared with a 1 percent rise in Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index.Toyota’s recall of more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011 hurt the company’s reputation for reliability and safety.The effect of the recalls on sales and loyalty remains “difficult to isolate,�� IHS Automotive analyst Rebecca Lindland said.“A lot of their growth through the early 2000s were first-time Toyota buyers,�� she said. “Those are the people that were most vulnerable to saying, ‘I’ll never own a Toyota again.�� The long term effects won’t fully be realized until all of the cars that have been impacted by the recall have been retired.”The biggest safety crisis in Toyota’s history began to get public notice in August 2009 when an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer Mark Saylor and three members of his family were killed in a Lexus ES 350 that crashed at a high speed.A separate lawsuit over the death of the Saylor family was settled out of court. A handful of wrongful death and personal injury cases are still pending, but the vast majority of the litigation over unintended acceleration will be finished if the proposed settlement is approved, said a person with knowledge of the remaining lawsuits who wished to remain anonymous.Within a half year of the Saylor family crash, Toyota President Akio Toyoda and other company executives were questioned in a high-profile U.S. Congressional hearing, and Toyoda made a public apology.Toyota maintained all along that its electronic throttle control system was not at fault, and reiterated that on Wednesday. It has blamed ill-fitting floor mats and sticky gas pedals for the problem.A study by U.S. safety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and NASA found no link between the reports of unintended acceleration and Toyota’s electronic throttle control system.The settlement, which must be approved by a California federal judge, includes direct payments to customers as well as the installation of a brake override system in more than 2.7 million vehicles, according to the settlement agreement filed in court.The terms include a $250 million fund for former Toyota owners who sold vehicles at reduced prices and a separate $250 million fund for owners not eligible for the brake override system.Attorneys for the plaintiffs are slated to receive up to $200 million in fees and $27 million in costs, according to court documents.Richard Cupp, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said the settlement was large for the automotive sector but was dwarfed by other litigation involving economic loss claims. State cases against the tobacco industry, for instance, amounted to more than $200 billion.“That could mean that lawsuits like these could become increasingly common, even where there is not provable physical injury on large scale,�� Cupp said.The case is In re: Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 10-ml-02151. ($1 = 85.6700 Japanese yen)	2.420574887
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators have opened a preliminary investigation into consumer complaints of driver’s side door fires in 2007 model year Toyota Motor Corp Camry sedans and RAV4 crossover SUVs.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said an estimated 830,000 vehicles may be affected. This probe is short of a recall but may lead to one.Six consumers have complained, NHTSA said in a filing that shows the investigation was opened this week.“Based on the available information, it appears the fires are originating from the power window master switch located on the driver’s side door,�� the filing says.Toyota said it awaits more information from NHTSA before responding to the government agency.“Toyota received the Preliminary Evaluation Opening Resume for the 2007 RAV4 and Camry on February 7. However, we have not received an information request from the NHTSA. Toyota will fully cooperate with the agency in its efforts to investigate these allegations,�� the company said in an email statement.Nissan Motor Co is recalling almost 37,000 Versa small cars with manual transmissions in the United States because they potentially could be shifted out of park without depressing the brake pedal, according to documents filed with NHTSA.NHTSA said 36,608 Versas from model year 2012 with manual transmissions may experience interference between the shifter rod and shift knob. That could cause the driver to inadvertently shift the vehicle into gear without stepping on the brake pedal, increasing the risk of an accident, according to NHTSA documents.Nissan discovered the problem in November 2011 during a dealer vehicle inspection and will notify owners and replace the shifter knob or shifter assembly as necessary, NHTSA said. The recall is expected to begin on February 20.A Nissan official said no accidents or injuries have been reported in relation to this issue.(Reporting By Bernie Woodall and Ben Klayman; editing by John Wallace, Phil Berlowitz)	4.904321379
WARSAW (Reuters) - Belgian Thierry Neuville won the Rally of Poland in a Hyundai one-two on Sunday to slash Sebastien Ogier’s overall lead in the world championship to 11 points with five rounds remaining.New Zealander Hayden Paddon finished second, one minute 23.9 seconds behind, with France’s four-times world champion Ogier third for M-Sport Ford and nearly a minute further back.It was Neuville’s third win in eight rallies and came after a hard-fought battle with Estonian Ott Taenak, Ogier’s team mate, who had led on Sunday morning only to hit a tree and retire.Taenak’s departure left Neuville more than a minute clear and the Belgian was quick to commiserate with his rival after the 21st stage.“I’m sorry for him because he did an unbelievable rally,�� he told the wrc.com website. “A lot of people in the previous stage told me he was pushing far too hard.”Toyota’s Jari-Matta Latvala won the final power stage to take five bonus points. Ogier has 160 points to Neuville’s 149 while Latvala is on 112.	7.695935113
NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - European and Japanese companies led U.S.-listed shares of foreign firms lower on Wednesday amid violent anti-austerity clashes in Spain and Greece, as many Tokyo-traded shares went ex-dividend.Violent clashes in the streets of Athens and Madrid underscored the troubles the euro zone must resolve in order to move forward reforms imposed on both economies.Euro zone equities had their worst session in two months, with banks among the hardest hit as traders cashed in recent gains in the sector. U.S.-traded shares of Banco Santander fell 4.1 percent to $7.52 and those of Deutsche Bank dropped 4.5 percent to $39.58.The BNY Mellon index of leading ADRs fell 1 percent and the subindex of European ADRs lost 1.2 percent.In Japan, about 55 percent of the broad Topix index components passed the deadline for investors to be awarded rights to first-half dividends, drying up demand.

DETROIT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - August U.S. auto sales on Thursday are seen declining around 3 percent from a year ago, as it appears that sales this year may not top the record set in 2015.Major U.S. carmakers will issue sales reports throughout the day, the largest ones coming in the morning.August U.S. sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate are seen at 17.25 million vehicles, with forecasts ranging from 16.9 million to 18 million vehicles, according to a survey of 35 economists by Thomson Reuters.“We continue to remind investors that we believe we are in a plateauing U.S. light vehicle sales environment, and do not think that we have ‘peaked,�� as that would imply a material drop in sales,�� said Buckingham Research Group.July’s U.S. sales were surprisingly strong, which may have pressured August sales, according to Buckingham.Sales hit a record 17.47 million vehicles in 2015, and most analysts believe that results this year will be down slightly. RBC Capital Markets, for instance, forecast 17.3 million vehicles while others such as Kelly Blue Book see sales beating last year’s mark.August results for General Motors Co, the largest automaker in the U.S. market by sales, are seen down around 5.5 percent, according to analysts polled by Reuters, while Ford Motor Co was down between 7 percent and 10 percent.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s sales were either just below or just above year-ago figures, while Toyota Motor Corp was also on par with a year ago.Some analysts forecast small sales gains and others small sales losses for Toyota, No. 3 in the U.S. market, and FCA, No. 4.

(Attaches to additional alert)TOKYO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Thursday it would recall an estimated 400,000 vehicles globally as a precautionary measure to replace potentially deadly air bag inflators made by Takata Corp.The recall follows a similar move by Toyota Motor Corp after an “unusual deployment�� of a Takata-made inflator when a Toyota subcompact was scrapped in Japan last month.A Honda spokeswoman said the automaker would need to set aside more reserves to pay for the latest recalls as well as the voluntary expansion globally of a region-specific recall limited to certain hot and humid areas in the United States.She said she could not disclose a specific figure.Subject to the latest recall are about 177,000 vehicles in Japan, including the Fit, Civic hybrid, CR-V, Accord and other models produced in 2003.No injuries or accidents have been reported.The rest of the recalls include about 22,000 vehicles in the Americas excluding the United States, 100,000 in Europe, 70,000 in Asia-Pacific. The 400,000 vehicle figure is a rough estimate, the spokeswoman said. (Reporting by Chang-Ran Kim; Editing by Chris Gallagher)	-0.03965421524
PARIS, May 16 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has begun exporting French-made Yaris compact cars to customers in North America for the first time this month.Toyota said it planned to export around 25,000 gasoline versions of the Yaris built at the northern French town of Onnaing, near Valenciennes, to the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico annually.“There are many reasons to preserve production of compact cars in France but all partners need to work together to maintain Toyota Motor Manufacturing France’s competitive advantage,�� Toyota Motor Europe Chief Executive Didier Leroy said in a statement on Thursday.The Yaris accounted for nearly 22 percent of Toyota’s total European sales in 2012, with 182,841 vehicles, the Japanese carmaker said.Production in France for export to North America began on May 6, it said.Toyota’s plan, unveiled last June, followed decisions by Japanese rivals Honda Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp to open factories in Mexico to serve North America and reduce loss-making exports from Japan.French carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen are trying to cut costs as they struggle with overcapacity and weak demand for cars in Europe.Renault aims to cut 7,500 posts in France by 2016 and has negotiated a nationwide deal on pay and conditions to boost competitiveness, while PSA is scrapping more than 10,000 domestic jobs and closing an assembly plant near Paris.	-5.450832548
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is looking at diverting shipments to Dalian and Shanghai ports from Tianjin, China’s main car import terminal, where operations have been indefinitely disrupted after massive explosions last week, according to a senior Beijing-based company executive.Research firm IHS Automotive has estimated it could take at least a couple of months for normal port operations in Tianjin to resume, and other automakers such as Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and BMW have also said they have made moves to switch to Shanghai and other ports.The senior Toyota executive told Reuters that Shanghai and Dalian ports should have enough capacity to prevent a severe logistical problem for the Japanese automaker in the world’s biggest auto market.“Port of Tianjin will likely be unusable for a long while, although I have no idea at the moment how long these disruptions would last,�� the official said, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak with reporters.A company spokesman in Japan confirmed Toyota was considering rerouting cars to other ports.Huge explosions ripped through Tianjin port on Aug. 12, killing at least 114 people. Investigators have not determined the cause of the blasts at the world’s 10th-largest port, the gateway to China’s industrial northeast.Shanghai port’s sole auto terminal could see a 10 percent increase in car volume over normal levels based on queries it has been receiving from clients, said a marketing department official at Shanghai Haitong International Automotive Terminal Co Ltd.China imported 1.4 million cars in 2014, according to customs data. The Shanghai terminal alone has an annual capacity of 2-3 million, said the official, who declined to be identified.“We’re only a temporary solution to the difficulties in Tianjin,�� he said. “We can’t be a substitute for Tianjin. After this, Tianjin will definitely continue to hold onto its dominant position.”Toyota’s two final assembly plants near Tianjin port suspended their operations from Monday to Wednesday, in part to assess the damage from the blasts. Toyota produced 432,340 vehicles at the two plants last year, according to IHS. It estimated a production loss of 2,200 cars per day as a result of the explosions.The port accounts for about 40 percent of China’s imported cars, the research firm said.	-5.728340209
LONDON (Reuters) - Five times world rally champion Sebastien Ogier has signed a new contract keeping him at the British-based M-Sport Ford team through 2018 and ending speculation about retirement.Welsh driver Elfyn Evans, who won his home round of the championship last month, is also staying while Estonian Ott Tanak has left for Toyota.News on a third car is expected soon.“It’s great to finally announce our plans for 2018,�� Ogier said in a team statement on Tuesday.“What we have achieved together has been truly amazing, and we want to see that continue �� to continue this fantastic journey and to defend all that we have achieved together,�� added the 33-year-old Frenchman.Ogier joined M-Sport a year ago after Volkswagen, with whom he won his first four titles, pulled out as part of a strategic shift to help the German carmaker overcome a costly emissions scandal.At the end of this season he had won 40 rallies.“In Sebastien and Elfyn, we have a strong chance of defending our titles,�� said M-Sport principal Malcolm Wilson.“They’re both very intelligent drivers.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Japan's Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T on Wednesday said that while it is deepening its development and production partnership with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, the small automaker would remain a company independent from its much bigger rival. Mazda and Toyota last week said they will build a $1.6 billion joint assembly plant in Alabama, and the two companies are working together to develop electric cars, automated driving systems and connected vehicles.“Despite this technology partnership, Mazda intends to remain an independent company,�� Masahiro Moro, president and CEO of Mazda’s North American operations, said at an auto industry conference in Detroit.“We are driven to make cars and SUVs our way, focusing on making driving better.”The two companies last year established a new venture company to develop electric vehicle technology, pooling resources to compete with global rivals in an increasingly frenetic race to produce more battery-powered cars.Mazda has been strengthening its partnership with Toyota as Japan’s fifth-largest automaker has said it would be difficult to develop expensive technology for electric vehicles and self-driving cars on its limited budget, which is roughly one-tenth that of Toyota’s.	-2.00533795
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Tuesday it would cut up to 100 jobs in Australia, a move to downsize its production as export orders dropped.Exports make up about 70 percent of Toyota’s Australian operation, and the drop in export orders has made its current manufacturing size “unsustainable��, the company said in a statement.“We are now seeing gaps in our plans that must be closed to secure investment for the next generation vehicle and to maintain our export program,�� said Toyota Australia’s president and CEO Max Yasuda.The carmaker would make up to 100 voluntary redundancies at its Altona manufacturing plant in Victoria state, as it reduced production from 470 vehicles a day to 431.Toyota employs 2,500 people at the Altona plant.	-1.643391714
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it would halt production at all car assembly plants in Japan from Feb. 8 to Feb. 13 due to a steel shortage following an explosion at a steel plant of one of its affiliates.The world's biggest automaker said on Saturday a blast at an Aichi Steel Corp 5482.T plant on Jan. 8 had curbed production of steel used in auto parts including engines, transmissions and chassis. It gave no specifics on how car production would be affected.“Operations are scheduled to recommence on Feb. 15, and vehicle production on lines outside Japan will not be suspended,�� Toyota said in a statement.Toyota said it was looking at options including asking Aichi Steel to produce parts on alternate lines and procuring specialised steel from other makers.Late last week, it said it had enough inventory to keep the factories running until Feb. 6.Toyota shares rose 1.8 percent on Monday, tracking broad market gains, as investors brushed off the announcement.Toyota produced 4.0 million vehicles in Japan in 2015, roughly 46 percent of which was exported.It produced around 13,600 vehicles a day in December, up 10 percent from a year earlier, due in part to the start of production of the latest Prius petrol hybrid.The stoppage illustrates the risks of Toyota’s “just-in-time�� inventory system, under which the company receives parts several times a day according to requirements, avoiding the need for excessive inventories.A plant fire at an affiliate supplier brought domestic production to a halt in 1997. Factories came back online around five days later after Toyota corralled suppliers in its close-knit “keiretsu�� group and other firms to improvise systems to come up with replacement parts.	-11.13787375

LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Carmaker Nissan said it and other Japanese companies would meet Prime Minister Theresa May and Finance Minister Philip Hammond on Thursday to discuss their business in the country, as concerns about Brexit mount.Japanese firms have spent billions of dollars in Britain over recent decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent.Carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda began their operations in Britain in the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain’s 1.67 million cars, the vast majority of which were exported overseas.But like the rest of the industry, they are concerned that their exports could face tariffs of up to 10 percent and be subject to lengthy customs delays after Brexit.“Nissan Europe Chairman Paul Willcox will join representatives from other Japanese companies in meeting the Prime Minister and Chancellor on Thursday to discuss our operations and investments in the UK,�� the firm said in a statement.“We will not be disclosing details of the discussions.�� (Reporting by Costas Pitas, editing by Guy Faulconbridge)	-3.042475638
TOKYO (Reuters) - Makers of airless tires such as Japan’s Bridgestone Corp. hope driverless cars will herald a breakthrough for their niche technology, which is more than a decade old but underperforms standard tires in every way except resistance to puncture.Autonomous driving - and the eventual introduction of self-driving taxis - could mean greater demand for puncture-resistant tires as greater usage of vehicles exposes them to more flat tires.“In the past, a car would be driven about 20% of the time and spend the other 80% in the garage,�� Atsushi Ueshima of Bridgestone said at the biennial Tokyo Motor Show on Thursday.“In the age of shared, autonomous vehicles, it will be the opposite, and preventing breakdowns will be a top priority.”France’s Michelin pioneered the technology, showcasing the first prototype in 2005 on a wheelchair. The commercial launch came in 2012, but uses have so far been mostly limited to ride-on lawnmowers and golf carts, along with construction machinery, where the chance of a puncture is high.Toyota Group truckmaker Hino Motors Ltd used the motor show to display a vision of the future where electric, modular, people-to-parcel movers run on airless tires of its own design. Toyota Motor Corp showed a hydrogen-powered concept car fitted with Sumitomo Rubber Industries prototypes at the previous event in 2017.Michelin and General Motors Co have announced a joint research agreement aiming to have airless tires on passenger cars by as early as 2024. Testing starts this year on the Bolt electric vehicle in Michigan.For electrified vehicles (EV) in particular, the tires�� design - a band of rubber encircling polymer spokes around an aluminum hub - allows for motors to be fitted directly inside the wheel, opening up space in the chassis to extend leg room or expand the trunk.EV manufacturers also hope that airless tires will in the future weigh less than their standard cousins, allowing crucial extra kilometers of driving range given consumer concerns about running out of power far from the nearest charging station.So far though, making them more lightweight has proved difficult. Sumitomo Rubber says it has been able to reduce weight slightly by changing the shape of the polymer spokes, but the heft of the rubber tread still makes it a little heavier than current conventional tires.Structurally, too, there are challenges. Sumitomo Rubber has been able to increase the size of its prototypes somewhat since the last motor show, but it is still far from making them big enough and strong enough for a bus or truck.“There will definitely be demand for airless tires for commercial vehicles in the future, but making something than can support that weight is a really huge obstacle,�� Hiroshi Ohigashi, of Sumitomo Rubber, said at the motor show.Manufacturing costs are also a little higher than for pneumatic tires, but both Sumitomo Rubber and Bridgestone expect an eventual move to mass production would solve that.	3.035998265
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said its solid-state battery technology under development could be a “game changer�� for electric vehicles, but that does not mean it is moving away from hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles.Having long touted fuel-cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids as the most sensible technologies to make cars greener, Japan’s top-selling automaker surprised industry watchers last year with plans to add full-sized electric vehicles (EVs) to its line-up.In doing so, it joins a rush of global automakers scrambling to develop more EVs, in large part due to China’s push to promote the technology as a way to reduce pollution in the world’s biggest car market.“We believe our solid-state battery technology can be a game changer with the potential to dramatically improve driving range,�� Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said at the Tokyo Motor Show, which opened to media on Wednesday.Toyota plans to roll out a new electric vehicle in the early 2020s powered by solid-state batteries, which also promise to reduce the long charging times currently required.Although China has heavily promoted electric cars, Japan has outlined plans to pioneer a hydrogen-fueled society.Leroy noted that Toyota was introducing two new fuel-cell vehicles at the motor show, including the six-seater “Fine-Comfort Ride�� concept car, with a cruising range of about 1,000 km (620 miles).A production version of the second model, the “Sora�� fuel-cell bus, will be launched next year, with more than 100 expected to be sold, mainly in Tokyo, ahead of the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held in the city.	3.032532287
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors GM.N is overhauling its Chinese line-up with a greater emphasis on electric cars and smart-driving technology to stem a slide in sales after more than two decades of growth in a country that contributes nearly a fifth of its profit.GM’s new China boss Julian Blissett told Reuters it would renew its focus on luxury Cadillacs, roll out bigger but greener sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and target entry-level buyers with low-cost micro electric vehicles (EVs).He said new technologies such as EVs and cars with near hands-free driving for highways would play a key role in GM’s China initiatives, which are part of a push to regain momentum lost in the face of intense competition and shifting tastes.Blissett, who replaced China veteran Matt Tsien this year, spoke to Reuters ahead of GM’s Tech Day event in Shanghai later on Wednesday, where he and Chief Executive Mary Barra are expected to announce some of the new technology and product rollout plans.“This market is rapidly electrifying. Cadillac is on a path to very heavy electrification. Buick is also going to heavily electrify,�� said Blissett, adding that GM’s Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling would also go down the electric route.“The market is changing dramatically. So the concept of standing still in China doesn’t work.”GM sells its Chevrolets, Buicks and Cadillacs in China as well as its local brands Wuling and Baojun and has been one of the foreign success stories in the world's biggest auto market along with Germany's Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE. But GM sales have taken a hit, falling to 3.1 million vehicles in 2019 from a record 4 million in 2017.A slowdown in China’s economy and the resulting weakness in its auto market have been a big factor behind GM’s sales slump, but analysts say competition has become fierce too.Toyota 7203.T, Volkswagen and Honda 7267.T have been eating into GM's business while Chinese automakers such as Geely 0175.HK and Great Wall 601633.SS are making better-quality cars that can compete more effectively with the global giants.GM is also facing competition from Tesla TSLA.O while Lynk &amp; Co and Polestar, brands affiliated with Volvo, have rolled out sleek eye-catching designs that Chinese consumers crave. In 2017, GM China had a 14.3% share of overall sales of 28.2 million vehicles. By 2019, that had fallen to a share of 12.2% out of 25.4 million cars.Blissett said the key objective of its strategy was to get back to sales of 4 million vehicles a year as soon as possible.“Our business is a high engineering cost, high capital cost business, so, without scale, it’s quite difficult to make money. We do need to return to that,�� he told Reuters.He said he could not give a precise timeframe for when GM would hit its goal because of the uncertainty about how fast economies around the world recover from the coronavirus fallout.Some GM officials have admitted privately that its brands, especially Chevrolet, have been slow to introduce more SUVs in China as they became increasingly popular.However, both Buick and Chevrolet now have four SUVs each and Cadillac has three, Blissett said.Analysts have also said the promotion of its top-end Cadillac brand came at the expense of Buick and Chevy sales, and that it failed to match rivals with their sleeker designs.Blissett said GM would sell bigger SUVs, many of them electric, for its Chevy, Buick and Cadillac brands, though traditional gasoline-powered SUVs still offered GM “huge opportunities�� to boost sales in China.GM also wants to transform Wuling into a brand more focused on micro, electric “people-mover�� vans, he said.“In the next five years, more than 50% of our capital and engineering deployment will go towards electrification and autonomous-drive technology. That should give you an indication where GM is betting on its future,�� GM’s Blissett said.“Chinese consumers are very embracing of technology, be that technology on the phone, be that e-commerce, be that intelligent driving technology, be that electrification. Although Europe and the U.S. have fairly significant plans on a governmental and market point of view, the electrification of cars is going to happen much faster here in China,�� he said.“We intend to be right in the heart of that market. So, we will heavily play in the EV space. And that’s the reason why we are investing as we are.”GM’s Wuling and Baojun brands have borne the brunt of falling sales over the past two years as lower-income consumers bought fewer cars in the face of slower growth and as competition from Chinese rivals at the entry level intensified.There are signs of life at Wuling, however, with sales up 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020.GM hopes its new Wuling MINI EV launched this year, a micro two-door car, and a series of similar cars in the pipeline, will help it win back share. Before EV subsidies, the MINI EV can cost as little as 28,800 yuan ($4,150) for a basic model.‘WINNERS AND LOSERS’To be sure, GM has made blunders, such as equipping some compact cars with unpopular three-cylinder engines. That hit GM sales significantly and it had to resurrect a four-cylinder gasoline engine for some models.Still, analysts said much of the body blow GM’s brands took in China has come from local brands that have significantly improved the quality of their cars and as Japanese and German rivals boosted sales despite a weaker overall market.Beijing’s emphasis on greener vehicles has also significantly pushed up the costs associated with the designing and manufacturing cars, which have combined to trigger a shake-up of China’s auto industry.Already, small Chinese brands such as Lifan have gone out of business while French carmaker PSA PEUP.PA has scaled back its operations significantly and Renault RENA.PA, which is in a global alliance with Nissan 7201.T, packed up and left.“There is a revolution going on in the industry,�� said Blissett. “There are also winners and losers in the global brands. The trend is actually for the local brands to lose share if you look at the total trend. Luxury is a gain in share.”Analysts expect the consolidation in the auto industry to continue unabated in the coming years, with more failures, and also more mergers and acquisitions.China auto industry expert Michael Dunne said if GM failed to manage its numerous brands in China properly, one might end up becoming a casualty.“The introduction of Cadillac has had the effect of knocking Buick down a notch in the eyes of Chinese consumers,�� he said. “Buick is tilting more towards where Chevy plays, and as a result the two brands are crowding each other and are now throwing weaker punches.��	-0.7100066563
LONDON (Reuters) - Leaving the European Union without a deal at the end of this month will force businesses to navigate an unprecedented set of challenges from potential blockages at ports to the introduction of paperwork and tariffs.More than 10,000 trucks a day pass through the port of Dover, Britain’s most important gateway to Europe, carrying 119 billion pounds ($150 billion) worth of trade a year. The potential for gridlock has forced companies to use alternative ports, reserve air cargo capacity and stockpile parts.This is what companies have said about the threat and actions taken to mitigate the impact:Dover is as prepared as it can be but there are uncertainties over the extent to which freight operators are ready for new declarations and whether France will keep goods moving, the port’s chief executive said. Doug Bannister expects potential problems to be felt from the week of Nov. 4, noting that traffic should be lighter on Friday Nov. 1 as it as a French public holiday.Getlink, the operator of the Eurotunnel service moving cars and lorries under the Channel, has created two “pit stop�� control areas -- one on the English and one on the French side -- to help speed the processing of documents for truck drivers.It has also added here a control zone at its French terminal with nine inspection bays and 100 parking spaces to allow authorities to check goods from the UK without halting other traffic, and a 240-space parking zone for lorries heading to Britain.For British retailers, Oct. 31 is about the worst possible timing for Brexit, coming just before the Christmas trading period which means warehouses are already packed with products.������ Although supermarket groups, such as Tesco TSCO.L and Sainsbury's SBRY.L, can build up stocks of non-perishable items, in reality there is limited capacity in supply chains to make that possible.A hard Brexit will affect suppliers of some fresh foods, such as lettuces, tomatoes, citrus and soft fruits which come from southern Europe. Shortages and price inflation could ensue.While the British government has set a temporary tariff regime that will make 88% of total imports by value eligible for levy free access, goods such as ceramics, cheese and clothing will face some tariffs.Britain's car industry, the country's biggest exporter of goods, faces tariffs on vehicles, engines and components, new bureaucracy and delays at ports which could halt output at factories reliant on just-in-time delivery of parts. BMW BMWG.DE, Toyota 7203.T and Jaguar Land Rover TAMO.NS will close factories for up to a week on or after Oct. 31 in case of any disruption.The interconnected nature of the industry means the impact would be felt across the continent including at the likes of Ford's F.N Cologne factory in Germany where roughly one in three cars is exported to Britain. Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE has increased stockpiles of cars in Britain.. The German group is the market leader in Britain, Europe's second-largest car market, notching up nearly half a million sales, almost all of which are imported.Many automakers use British facilities as export hubs to the rest of the continent and do not make the same models at other factories in the EU, meaning they cannot quickly source or move output elsewhere. In the longer-term, no-deal Brexit tariffs of 10% on vehicles would be unsustainable for Nissan 7201.T in Europe, where it runs Britain's biggest car factory.“We are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won’t be sustainable for us,�� the firm’s European Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy said, referring to possible World Trade Organization tariffs.The risk of drug shortages has been among the biggest worries associated with a disorderly Brexit, with 45 million patient packs going from the United Kingdom to other European countries each month, while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction, industry figures show.Major drugmakers such as Bayer BAYGn.DE, Novartis NOVN.S, AstraZeneca AZN.L and GSK GSK.L have all taken contingency steps to secure their supply. Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO and Sanofi SASY.PA, Europe's largest diabetes drug companies, for instance, have spent millions of pounds stockpiling insulin in Britain and are building new shipping and air freight routes.Some drugs, such as Bayer’s radiopharmaceutical Xofigo against prostate cancer, would perish if stockpiled. Bayer is working on simplified customs arrangements with the British authorities.The government has also signed deals with ferry companies worth 86.6 million pounds to ensure the continued supply of medicines, and created a “Support Unit�� to help suppliers of medical goods prepare and have customs paperwork in place.Britain and the EU have put measures in place to ensure that flights can continue in any exit scenario.Airlines will also have to adjust to rules that mean those not majority owned by EU nationals face the threat of losing their right to fly within the bloc. Most major European airlines say they either comply with the rules or will curb the voting rights of non-EU shareholders in order to remain aloft.The National Farmers Union has described a no-deal Brexit as “catastrophic for British farming��. The EU is set to impose tariffs which could cripple trade in some products. A 46% tariff on lamb, for example, would make British exports uncompetitive in key markets such as France. Delays at the border could also make trade in perishable goods such as fresh produce unviable.If Britain leaves the EU without a deal it becomes an independent coastal state. This means it will regain control over its waters but policing will be difficult given there will only be a few vessels patrolling a space several times the size of the surface area of the United Kingdom. Some seafood exports to the EU will also face tariffs while there is concern about the impact of customs checks given many products are perishable.	5.491371746
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T are curtailing production in China following the worst anti-Japan protests in decades, company officials and media reported on Wednesday, putting Toyota's 1 million-unit China sales target at risk.Lingering resentment in China may hurt demand for Japanese cars, consumer electronics and other goods at a time when slowing growth in Asia’s biggest economy in the wake of Europe’s debt crisis may weigh on overall consumer spending.China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in more than three years in the second quarter. A factory survey in August showed China’s manufacturing sector contracted at its sharpest pace in nine months.Reports of the auto closure details varied, but the Asahi newspaper said Toyota will completely halt China production in October and stop all exports to China from Japan.Separately, the Nikkei business daily said Toyota plans to add four days to a planned eight-day holiday closure at its mainstay plant in Guangdong Province, which builds 30,000 cars a month, beginning on Wednesday and will operate only one shift instead of two when it reopens in October.A Toyota spokeswoman said she could not comment on the report but said the company would issue a statement later.For its part, Nissan told Reuters it plans to halt production at a joint venture in China starting on Thursday, three days earlier than planned, and extending through next week’s national holiday period.“The fact that these guys have a nice excuse to cut down production in China where they are running what could be argued as being slightly excessive inventory levels is good news to the companies,�� a senior trader at a foreign brokerage in Tokyo said.Toyota sold about 900,000 vehicles in China last year. It had set a target of 1 million sales this year and a long-range goal of 1.8 million by 2015.Production at other Japanese companies has yet to return to normal more than a week after the biggest demonstrations, which at times degenerated into violent attacks on Japanese run stores and factories in China.Panasonic, which closed three factories that were damaged in the protests, reopened the last one on Tuesday, but production at that component factory has yet to return to normal, a spokeswoman for the company confirmed.Japan and China are at odds over a group of islands in the East China Sea, called Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. A decision by Japan to buy the islands from private owners sparked the latest flare-up in tensions between the Asian neighbors that has smoldered since the end of the World War II.	-1.665183679
* VW scandal may be setback for diesel technology* Diesel had been seen as solution to fuel-economy rules* Could benefit gas-electric hybrids, plug-in electric hybrids* May also help Japan’s hydrogen fuel-cell driveBy Norihiko Shirouzu and Maki ShirakiTOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The Volkswagen diesel emissions test rigging scandal could accelerate a shift towards gasoline-electric hybrid cars and plug-in electric hybrids - even as cheaper gasoline, for now, saps demand for green cars.The fallout from VW - where the cost of the scandal pushed the German automaker to a first quarterly loss in at least 15 years - is rippling through an industry already embracing alternative ‘greener�� propulsion systems to traditional gasoline and diesel.Diesel technology, which had been seen, especially among European carmakers, as a mainstream solution to helping the industry meet tougher fuel economy and emissions regulations, now looks vulnerable - though it’s far from finished.“Anybody can, with certainty, guess what’s going to happen ... This (VW) scandal is not going to make diesel more popular in the United States. This scandal is not going to make diesel more popular in Japan,�� Nissan Motor CEO Carlos Ghosn told reporters on Wednesday on the opening day of the Tokyo Motor Show.With diesel potentially falling out of favour, automakers and their technology suppliers will likely turn to non-diesel solutions in a stricter regulatory environment.Over the next five years and beyond, auto industry officials see hybrid technology - especially heavily electrified plug-in hybrid know-how - emerging more into the mainstream. Volkswagen itself is now looking closer at long-range plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles as it seeks to put the scandal behind it.“If you take out diesel as a key solution ..., initially conventional hybrid technology, and then plug-in hybrids, will have to be used to fill the gap,�� said a person close to AVL, a privately-owned global powertrain specialist. “Beyond 2020, hydrogen fuel-cell cars will have to play a greater role.”That would go down well in Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing for a so-called ‘hydrogen society��, with the zero-emission fuel powering homes and cars.Honda Motor operating officer Toshihiro Mibe says hydrogen fuel-cell cars - including the company’s first mass market model unveiled at the Tokyo show on Wednesday - are quietly gaining momentum.“Beyond 2020, we think diesel is not going to play a role at all in meeting fuel economy and emissions regulations,�� he told Reuters. “Electrification is costly technology to pursue, but manufacturing costs ... are coming down fast and we will hit a point soon where costs for electrified cars will be cheaper than for diesel cars.”Any broader shift to plug-in hybrid technology will likely benefit automakers like Toyota Motor and General Motors , which are already up and running with plug-in hybrids, such as the Prius variant and Chevrolet Volt on the market.“We believe hybrid cars�� competitiveness might gain a lot more steam as a consequence of the VW scandal,�� a senior Toyota executive told Reuters. “People who bought VW diesel cars in the U.S. are highly environmentally conscious. We hope (they) would switch to hybrids when they replace their diesel cars.”Similarly, as consumers turn to tried and trusted models, electrification parts suppliers such as Denso, Aisin , Bosch, Valeo, Delphi, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Continental and Visteon stand to gain business.All-electric battery cars will likely be less prominent, industry experts say, because of their limited driving range and cumbersome re-charging.In the shorter term, to meet regulatory requirements through to around 2018, conventional gas-electric hybrids, as opposed to plug-ins, should prove highly useful, experts added, as will be other fuel-saving technologies such as turbo-charging and ignition shut-on-and-off systems.“Shorter run, we would see a continued downsizing of gasoline engines using turbo charging. We would also see more direct injection of fuel, more 3-cylinder and even 2-cylinder engines ...,�� the person close to AVL said.But, with so much invested in capacity to produce diesel engines, industry executives aren’t writing off the technology just yet.“We still believe in the future of diesel engines because they are in the trade-off of emissions and CO2, they are a very good option for many vehicles,�� VW brand CEO Herbert Diess told reporters at the Tokyo show.Koei Saga, Toyota senior managing officer for powertrain technology, reckons diesel technology still has a role to play, especially in powering cars and trucks sold in emerging markets in Asia, South America and Africa, where affordability and fuel economy are key.As regulations and testing methods become more stringent in developed markets, diesel technology would have to advance significantly, making it as expensive to make diesel-fuelled cars as gasoline-electric hybrids.“It’s hard to see diesel becoming a mainstream solution,�� Saga told Reuters.

(Reuters) - A U.S. senator told federal safety regulators he is concerned that they didn’t go far enough in a probe that found Toyota Motor Corp’s electronics systems did not cause unintended acceleration incidents.Sen. Charles Grassley, Republican from Iowa, sent a letter, dated Thursday, to the regulators saying a phenomenon known as tin whiskers “may be a cause for concern.”In a statement, Toyota said, “No one has ever found a single real-world example of tin whiskers causing an unintended acceleration event.”Grassley’s letter said tin whiskers are “electronically conductive, crystalline structures of tin that sometimes grow from surfaces where tin (especially electroplated tin) is used as a final finish.”Company spokesman Brian Lyons said, “There have been a lot of theories that tin whiskers can cause unintended acceleration. The fact is, they never have.”The NHTSA said on Friday it would carefully review Grassley’s letter and respond appropriately.A NASA report issued in February 2011 as well as findings of an independent scientific panel in January 2012 support Toyota’s stance that its throttle systems were not the cause of the unintended acceleration events that prompted the worst safety crisis in the history of Japan’s leading automaker.About 8 million Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles were recalled in the United States in 2009 and 2010, which along with Japan is Toyota’s largest market. Toyota is No. 3 in U.S. sales so far this year.Millions of other Toyota and Lexus vehicles were recalled worldwide. The recalls were not for the electronic throttle systems. Many of them were for floor mats that could cause accelerator pedals to become stuck open.Grassley’s letter cites the NASA report as cautioning that even though NASA found no proof that the electronic throttle control system caused the reported unintended acceleration events, that does not mean they could not occur.Toyota said that there is no data that suggests that its vehicles are any more prone to “tin whiskers�� issues than those of other manufacturers.“In the unlikely event that tin whiskers cause a short- circuit in the pedal position sensor,�� Toyota’s statement said, “our systems detect the fault, illuminate the malfunction indicator light and put the vehicle into “limp home�� mode, allowing the driver to safely move the vehicle to the side of the road as designed.NHTSA and NASA reports on unintended acceleration can be found at www.nhtsa.gov/ua.	6.24426079
RICHMOND, Va. - Where the short tracks are concerned, Kevin Harvick and his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing team appear to have turned a corner.And on Friday afternoon at Richmond Raceway, Harvick got through the corners better than everyone else in winning the pole position for Saturday’s Toyota Owners 400 at the 0.75-mile track (7:30 p.m. ET on FOX, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).The Busch Pole Award was Harvick’s third at Richmond, his second of the season and the 27th of his career, setting up a showdown with the Joe Gibbs Racing and Team Penske cars that have monopolized Victory Lane in the first eight Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series events of the season.Harvick posted a lap at 124.298 mph (21.722 seconds) to edge Erik Jones (124.081 mph) for the top starting spot by .038 seconds. The front-row start will be Jones�� first of the season.Kurt Busch qualified third at 123.870 mph, a dramatic improvement over his 2019 average starting position of 20.1. Joey Logano and Kyle Busch completed the top five.“The cars definitely had a little fall-off,�� Harvick said. “I was just really just managing the fall-off and just trying to be consistent with the laps, but stickers (new tires) were definitely faster in the first round than they were in the second and third round.”Harvick was sixth in the first round, second to Kyle Busch in the second round and first with the pole at stake. Martin Truex Jr., Chase Elliott, Austin Dillon, Daniel Suarez and Jimmie Johnson earned positions six through 10 on the grid, respectively.For the first time, NASCAR limited each round to five minutes, with seven minutes between, condensing the entire qualifying session to 29 minutes. For Jones, who had a pit stall near the exit from pit road, the time limits weren’t an issue.“Short tracks, I think it’s fine,�� Jones said. “It’s a little hectic in the first round and even in the second round, but it’s easy for me to say. We had a great pit stall being first out. I could just roll out, and here it doesn’t benefit you to wait so you just roll out and get your lap in.”Harvick was fast last week at Bristol, only to have his prospects crushed by a pre-race penalty for multiple inspection failures and an early loose wheel that forced an unplanned pit stop. But at Richmond on Saturday, he’ll be leading the field to green.Nevertheless, there are plenty of unknowns, including a new Goodyear tire combination.“As you look at this place, this is really one of those places where you kind of have to go off of what happened last time,�� Harvick said. “New tire, so you don’t really know exactly what the cars are going to do deep into runs as far as how bad they will push, will it get looser.“What conditions will you be fighting? We wind up guessing a number of times when they change the tires like this, because you don’t know what to anticipate.��--By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor workers in Japan will receive a monthly increase in base pay of 10,700 yen ($96), lower than what unions were requesting, Jiji Press reported on Wednesday.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration has been urging Japan Inc to boost pay in an effort to drive the economy and conquer deflation.But major companies are expected to offer smaller increases this year at annual wage talks on Wednesday amid concerns about the global economy and a looming sales tax hike at home, according to a Reuters survey.	2.589891878

"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are sticking to their targets in Indonesia in defiance of the longest sales decline in six years, resorting to steep discounts to entice tight-spending consumers into showrooms that remain stubbornly empty.Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T aim to sell more cars this year than last, though overall sales to distributors have fallen each month since September and are down 17 percent in 2015.""The decline is pretty drastic,"" said dealership salesman Jonatan, whose monthly average sales of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T cars was four versus eight last year. ""We certainly have to work extra hard to sell cars these days.""Auto sales are a key indicator of consumption in Indonesia, where the economy is growing at its slowest since 2009, and where 7 percent inflation is eroding purchasing power. Consumers are consequently reserving more money for primary needs, the central bank said last month.In response, automotive industry association Gaikindo in June lowered its sales forecast for this year to a range of 1 million to 1.1 million vehicles from 1.2 million.“We are struggling with the market slowdown,�� said PT Honda Prospect Motor director Jonfis Fandy.The firm has been trying to boost sales since early in the year via promotions usually reserved for Indonesia’s annual automotive exhibition in August, to meet Honda’s target sales increase of 10 percent.Promotions include discounts on down payments, low-interest loans, and extending installment periods to seven years from around four. Honda has sold 1.4 percent more cars as of end-May.At Mazda, which aims to sell 9 percent more cars, one customer said he was offered 11 percent off a 450 million rupiah ($33,860.05) sports utility vehicle. But the mid-30s communication manager still delayed purchase for six months as economic conditions made him worry about finances.Astrid Ariani Wijaya, senior marketing manager at PT Mazda Motor Indonesia - for whom year-to-date sales figures are unavailable - said the slowdown is affecting all industries, not just auto.“What we are doing is maintaining advertising consistency in mass media,�� she said. “Discounts would depend on the model, and each dealer has different stocks.”Inflation and a weak rupiah are keeping the benchmark interest rate high at 7.5 percent, so the central bank is trying to boost demand by easing the passenger car down payment requirement to 25 percent from 30 percent.“Willingness to spend money on big purchases is not there,�� said BNI Securities analyst Thendra Crisnanda. “So I doubt the down payment easing will be a significant help.”Auto demand usually peaks before Indonesia’s Lebaran holiday in mid-July as consumers buy cars to visit home towns, but this year it is far less than expected, Crisnanda said.At Toyota, one dealership salesman said supplies had fallen for its most popular multi-purpose vehicle, the Avanza.Rahmat Samulo, a director at PT Toyota Astra Motor, said the company is making supply-demand adjustments and that, “if the stock is enough, we are not going to add excessively.”Toyota has sold 25 percent fewer cars as of end-May. It declined to disclose its 2015 target, but said it aims to maintain its market share of around 33 percent.Japan’s top automaker opened its second local plant in 2013, will open an engine factory next year, and plans to invest further in the country. Despite the slowdown, investment plans are “still on track��, an official at PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia told Reuters.At Nissan, where sales are down 22 percent, its two local factories are running at 40 percent capacity, and have inventory turnover of about two months versus less than one month “during good days��, Trimegah Securities said in a June report.PT Nissan Motor Indonesia president director Steve Ardianto did not comment on production. But he said the firm is offering variants of current models, adding dealerships and improving service to lift its 2015 share to 6 percent from 4.7 percent."	-4.241288872

FRANKFURT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Thailand is set to approve the construction of a Volkswagen factory near the port of Bangkok, German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported, citing the Thai investment authority BOI.A decision from the authority could come as early as next week, the paper said on Monday.The investment, under Thailand’s “Eco2�� programme, would secure tax and customs advantages for Volkswagen if it builds fuel efficient cars, provided the factory produces more than 100,000 vehicles and comes on stream by 2019.The paper cited senior BOI officials as saying Volkswagen plans to export cars from Thailand.A Volkswagen spokesman declined to comment.VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn has repeatedly said that his company needed to expand its presence in southeast Asia if it is to achieve its goal of unseating Toyota as global market leader.	-1.48020654
TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will recall 6.58 million vehicles globally to fix faults in the steering and seats, a company draft statement showed on Wednesday, in one of the largest recalls to date in the global auto industry.The world’s biggest automaker is recalling certain Yaris, Urban Cruiser, RAV4 and Hilux models after identifying faults in the steering column, wiring harnesses and seat railings of 1,058 vehicles. The Yaris is also sold as the Vitz and the Urban Cruiser under the Scion brand as the xA.The recall tally was preliminary and subject to review until a formal announcement in Japan later on Wednesday, a Toyota representative said.The recall covers models of the Yaris subcompact and Urban Cruiser SUVs assembled between January 2005 and August 2010 as well as RAV4 SUVs and Hilux compact pickups made between June 2004 and December 2010, Toyota said in the statement.It said 825,000 of the affected vehicles were in Europe but that it was not aware of any accidents related to these faults.It was not immediately clear if the faults were due to design or manufacturing issues.

TORONTO, June 3 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales rose 5.3 percent in May, marking a slowdown from April, but far outpacing the lackluster 2.4 percent year-to-date growth, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc.Across Canada, 185,040 vehicles were sold last month, just shy of the record set in May 2007 when 185,471 cars and trucks were sold, according to the independent auto analyst who compiles auto sales data.Ford Motor Co was Canada’s top auto seller as brisk demand for new trucks more than offset a decline in car sales.Chrysler Group LLC and General Motors rounded out the top three sellers in Canada, with all three Detroit automakers performing better than the prior year. Toyota Motor Corp was not far behind, notching its best monthly Canadian sales since August 2008.Ford said Canadian sales rose 0.5 percent last month compared to a year earlier, as total vehicle sales hit 32,490 in May, up from 32,338 last year.Truck sales climbed 4.6 percent to 23,537 vehicles, while car sales fell 8.9 percent to 8,953 vehicles.So far this year, Ford said its Canadian vehicle sales are up 5.7 percent over the same period in 2012. Truck sales are up 7.3 percent and car sales are 1.2 percent higher year-to-date.Chrysler said its Canadian vehicle sales rose nearly 12 percent in May from a year ago, bolstered by record sales for key models and a jump in car sales.Chrysler Canada, which said May sales ranked as one of its top 10 best months ever, sold 29,249 cars and trucks, up from 26,218 during the same period in 2012.Car sales rose 24.3 percent to 7,033 vehicles, with its Dodge Avenger setting record sales. The Dodge Dart also had its best month since it launched less than a year ago.Truck sales grew 8.1 percent to 22,216 vehicles, buoyed by record sales of its Ram truck and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan.Year to date, total sales at Chrysler Canada have climbed 6 percent, with car sales up 16.2 percent and truck sales up 3.7 percent.General Motors Co said Canadian sales rose 1.6 percent to 23,654 vehicles. Truck sales were up a modest 0.5 percent to 15,419, while car sales rose 3.6 percent to 8,235.So far this year, GM Canada’s total vehicle sales have climbed 2.6 percent. Truck sales gained 2.8 percent while car sales were up 2.1 percent.Toyota Canada sales rose 12.3 percent from a year ago. The Japanese automaker sold 22,250 vehicles, with truck sales up 14.2 percent to 8,550, a record for May. Passenger car sales rose 9.2 percent to 11,533 units.Honda Motor Corp’s Canadian sales jumped 22 percent over the prior year.In the U.S. market, Detroit’s Big Three automakers dominated strong sales for pickup trucks, which boosted May U.S. auto sales after a disappointing April.Total U.S. auto sales were on track to beat forecasts of a 6 percent rise from last year, to about 15.1 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate.	5.927617115
TOKYO (Reuters) - Long guarded about what was beneath the hood of its pioneering Prius cars, Toyota Motor Corp plans to open up its powertrain technology to rivals, hoping this will boost sales and speed up the industry’s shift to lower-emission vehicles.Announcing last week it would expand its gasoline hybrid technology development, the world’s largest automaker said it would consider selling complete powertrain modules - engines, transmissions and other drive components - to its competitors.The prospect of giving rivals access to “one-size-fits-all�� powertrains comes as cars are increasingly dependent on computerized components, making it easier to design similar parts across model ranges. The industry has moved on from competing largely on mechanical engineering.That trend will likely accelerate as automakers face pressure from regulators to further cut car emissions and develop more long-range electric vehicles.As cars become more like glorified computers, automakers are standardizing many mechanical parts and competing more on style and packaging - giving drivers a bigger range of features from automated parking to cockpit concierges.For Toyota, this is a big departure from having a tightly-knit network of suppliers keeping much of their jointly developed technology exclusive so as to have an engineering competitive edge on rivals.“Toyota suppliers produce a lot of technology which can only be used by Toyota,�� Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota’s powertrain company, told reporters. “We want to change that to a system where we develop technology with our suppliers at an earlier stage ... so they can make that technology available to non-Toyota customers.”Mizushima, who joined Toyota a year ago from group company Aisin Seiki Co, noted, for example, that past versions of Toyota’s hybrid system didn’t fit other automakers�� cars, limiting suppliers�� options to sell to non-Toyota customers.Powertrains combine parts often made separately by several independent parts makers, but Toyota’s are unique in that they are made by its group suppliers, allowing engineers at the automaker and its suppliers to collaborate in development.“Until now, we couldn’t sell the same inverter used in Toyota’s previous hybrid system to other customers because it wouldn’t fit the motor, or the voltage was different,�� said Yoshifumi Kato, executive director of engineering R&amp;D at Denso Corp, Toyota’s biggest supplier.“We can avoid this issue if suppliers can sell the entire system.”The move should help auto parts companies such as Denso and Aisin spread their customer base and compete better against global rivals including Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Continental. Currently, Toyota accounts for around half the annual sales at Denso and Aisin.SPREADING THE R&amp;D BURDENMizushima said he would like to see Toyota offer its powertrain modules to all its rivals, in an industry where more automakers are setting up exclusive tie-ups on parts.Nissan Motor Co this year launched the Infiniti QX30 luxury compact crossover using engines and other parts developed and made by Daimler AG’s Mercedes and its suppliers. Toyota already shares components for Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd’s Subaru BRZ sports car under a joint development agreement.In opening up its proprietary technology, Toyota is acknowledging the escalating costs of R&amp;D, as global automakers vie to develop hybrid and all-electric cars, self-driving cars and cars connected to mobile technology.Toyota's R&amp;D spend last year was 73 percent more than in 2010 at around $9 billion, while spending at Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, its biggest competitor, more than doubled over the same period.As automakers are having to invest more, they are cramming as much technology as possible into each vehicle, while limiting price increases. Toyota and its suppliers expect their newer production platform will mean making a lot more of fewer common parts across its models, and selling them to other automakers to earn back more of the money spent on R&amp;D.“If we take a component developed with Toyota and sell a million to Toyota and another million to other customers, it would double our return on our development costs,�� said Denso’s Kato.Toyota’s rivals, too, should be able to keep their own development and procurement costs down if they can source off-the-shelf from Toyota, say industry consultants.“It could be a win-win for Toyota and its rivals because Toyota could develop another sales line, while customers could gain access to components which may be cheaper and of higher quality than the same parts developed in-house,�� said Takeshi Miyao, Asia managing director at Carnorama.	-2.140495868

(Adds details from Toyota CEO and former Nissan executive)NEW YORK/DETROIT, April 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. said it will move its U.S. sales headquarters from southern California to suburban Dallas, delivering the latest blow to California in a fight for jobs with arch-rival Texas, whose Governor Rick Perry has been actively poaching businesses from the Golden State.The relocation from Torrance, a Los Angeles-area city of about 150,000, will bring much of the Japanese automaker’s U.S. operations under one roof in Plano, Texas, including sales, service, marketing, advertising and quality. Also moving to Texas will be some manufacturing staff now based in Erlanger, Kentucky, and corporate operations staff based in New York City.Toyota is the largest employer in Torrance, accounting for more than 5 percent of all jobs in the city with 3,837 workers in 2013, according to the city’s annual financial report. About 2,000 people from Toyota Motor Sales in Torrance will be affected by the move, and about 4,000 U.S. employees in all, the company said.Toyota’s move, which will take place in stages between this summer and the end of 2016, is the latest by a major employer to defect to the Lone Star State from California. Toyota has been in California since 1957, when it set up shop at a former Rambler dealership in Hollywood.In February, Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it would move from Los Angeles to Houston. In 2009, power company Calpine Corp abandoned San Jose for Houston and in 2006 engineering company Fluor Corp. relocated to the Dallas area from Orange County.It’s “sad news,�� Torrance mayor Frank Scotto said at a press conference Monday. “Toyota has been an integral part of the city.�� He said his son-in-law works for Toyota, so he faces the prospect of having to travel to Texas to see his daughter and grandchildren.Toyota’s decision also means all three of the major Japanese carmakers will have exited the state where they first got their footholds in the United States. Nissan Motor Co in 2006 moved most of its operations from Gardena, California, to Franklin, Tennessee, outside Nashville. Last year, Honda Motor Co decided to move a number of executives from Torrance to Columbus, Ohio.Perry has made luring businesses from other states a priority, making personal recruiting trips to sell what the Republican touts as a superior business climate, particularly lower taxes. California and New York State, both with Democratic governors, have been particular targets for the effort.On a poaching trip to New York last week, Perry challenged New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to a debate over which of the two states has a better business climate. There are about 50 people working in Toyota’s Manhattan office, and not all will be required to move.Toyota’s chief executive for North America, Jim Lentz, said Perry had no role in Toyota’s decision to move.Perry “is an interesting guy,�� Lentz said in an interview. “I’ve never met him. I talked to him on the phone today for the first time. This was never about Governor Perry courting us.”The company never gave California a chance to make a counter-offer, Lentz said, adding that it weighed as many as 100 possible sites over the past year.“California didn’t work out for a number of reasons, especially the distance from our U.S. manufacturing operations,�� he said. It would have been “disingenuous�� to seek an alternative proposal from California.When it came time to decide on the site from the four finalists, Plano “was clearly No. 1,�� Lentz said, but not because of the incentives it offered the company.“Our decision was not based on the dollar amount we received,�� but rather on a friendly overall business climate and certain advantages for Toyota employees, from affordable housing and shorter commutes to the absence in Texas of a personal income tax.Those supposed quality of life advantages don’t ensure success in a big corporate relocation, however.Larry Dominique, a former Nissan executive, recalled how Nissan lost about two-thirds of its California employees in the move to suburban Nashville.While some employees liked the lack of income tax in Tennessee, which was akin to “getting a 20-percent raise,�� Dominique said many others couldn’t be persuaded to go. That included a sizeable number who were not their family’s primary earners.Culture change is another challenge likely to be on Toyota’s horizon, said Dominique, who now heads an automotive research and consulting firm in Santa Barbara.“You lose centuries of institutional knowledge,�� he said. “In some departments, like in planning or branding, you have to retrain people on who you are.”Some employees will begin to move this summer, though most won’t until construction of a new headquarters in Texas is completed in late 2016 or early 2017, the company said.Toyota has a truck assembly plant in San Antonio, Texas, as well as manufacturing and assembly plants in eight other states, including Kentucky, Indiana and Mississippi.Meanwhile, the departure from Torrance will leave more than a gap in employment.According to the city’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the company was also Torrance’s third-highest property taxpayer, with a taxable assessed value of $473 million or over 2 percent of the city’s total taxable assessed value last year. Toyota also paid the city $203,037 in water revenue.Torrance had a $271.5 million budget in 2013 and about $121.5 million in long-term debt. In December 2012, credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Torrance to Aa2 from Aa1, citing a moderately weakened general fund compared to pre-recession levels, increasing pension payments and public safety costs.The departure could also hurt efforts by Los Angeles to regain its footing in the job market. The region’s unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent in February, well above the national rate of 6.7 percent. (Additional reporting by Tim Reid in Torrance.

(Corrects paragraph 41 to show Sean Kane is a consultant for plaintiffs�� lawyers, not a witness)TOKYO/DETROIT, June 22 (Reuters) - A year ago, Japan’s Takata Corp, the world’s second-largest maker of auto safety parts, believed it had finally contained a crisis more than a decade in the making.It was wrong.More than a million Honda Motor Co Ltd vehicles could be subject to an upcoming recall for Takata air bags that are at risk of exploding and shooting shrapnel at passengers and drivers, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.That would be in addition to 7.6 million vehicles already recalled by Honda and other automakers over the past five years.And the total could grow further still if Honda’s rivals like Nissan, Mazda and BMW also decide to fix more vehicles that were made in a two-year period when, Takata says, it botched production of air bag inflators and lost related records.The possible additional recalls would come at a time when General Motors is under scrutiny over why it took more than a decade to discover a faulty ignition switch linked to at least 13 deaths. As automakers promote over-the-horizon breakthroughs like self-driving cars, the industry’s mass safety-related recalls underline how much can still go wrong with some of the cheapest, most established technologies.In April and May 2013, Takata’s customers, led by Honda and Toyota Motor Corp, recalled more than 4 million vehicles due to the risk that defective air bag inflators could blow apart and shoot metal shards into vehicles in the event of an accident.Those 2013 recalls, which ranked as the largest ever for an air bag defect, contributed to a $300 million charge for Takata.Takata and Honda told U.S. safety regulators that the core of the problem was how the explosive material used to inflate Takata air bags had been handled and processed between 2000 and 2002 at plants in the United States and Mexico.The 2013 recalls involving Honda and four other carmakers were intended to close the books on a problem that had emerged as early as 2007 and had already been linked to two deaths.But just weeks after the 2013 recalls, on May 14, a 10-year-old Honda Fit was involved in an accident in western Japan that raised doubts about whether these recalls had gone far enough.The Fit’s passenger-side air bag exploded, according to Honda and Japan’s transport ministry. There were no injuries in the accident, in Okayama, so police did not give details, but safety investigators found the metal ejected by the air bag was so hot it set fire to the instrument panel and glove compartment.Honda was immediately concerned. The Fit had not been part of earlier recalls and it raised a doubt about whether more defective parts could be in circulation than previously identified. Honda engineers spent six months but failed to recreate the explosion, the company said.In November, Honda told Japan’s safety regulators it was still investigating a new air bag explosion case but did not see the need for another recall. A month later, it said in a statement to Reuters: “We have confirmed that (Takata) has conducted cause analysis and implemented counter measures, and that in the production process it is taking preventive measures.”Then, this month, Honda’s larger rival, Toyota, recalled another 650,000 cars in Japan for defective Takata air bags and called back 1.6 million vehicles previously recalled overseas, an unusual step.A complication, Toyota said, was that Takata’s records had proven to be incomplete. Takata spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa confirmed that the company had discovered a problem with records kept at its plant in Monclova, Mexico.Short of replacement parts from Takata, Toyota has decided to turn off air bags in Japan as customers come to dealerships with recalled vehicles, judging an inoperable passenger-side air bag to be safer than a potentially defective one.Meanwhile, Honda is moving to expand its own recalls, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. That could include more than a million more vehicles. Honda could also recall the 2003 Fit. “If we decide it is necessary, we will take measures quickly,�� Honda said in a statement.Other automakers are expected to follow. Nissan said it would take “prompt action as necessary��. Mazda and Chrysler said they were investigating. BMW said it was in touch with Takata and regulators.Yet more vehicles could be recalled if an ongoing U.S. safety investigation finds evidence of wider problems.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is examining whether Takata inflators made after 2002 are prone to fail and whether driving in high humidity contributes to the risk for air bag explosions.That would go beyond the manufacturing glitches that Takata and Honda previously identified.In a statement, Takata said it had come to believe humidity could be contributing to air bag explosions. The company said it had been working with NHTSA for several months.“Takata is committed to the highest standards of safety for our customers and their customers,�� Takata Chief Executive Shigehisa Takada said in the statement. “Takata is committed to ensuring the safety and functionality of its air bag inflators, and we strive to avoid any malfunction.”Takata spokesman Alby Berman said he could not comment beyond the statement.Takada, who could not be reached directly for further comment, is the son of Juichiro Takada, who took his Tokyo-based family run business from seatbelts into the production of air bags from the late 1980s.Like other suppliers, Takata relies on auto manufacturers to make the final determination on the scope and timing of recalls and has typically left disclosure of defects to them.Since the recalls in April and May last year, there have been at least six cases of Takata inflators exploding in the United States and two in Japan.In August, an inflator ruptured in a 2005 Honda Civic in the United States, sending a “one-inch piece of shrapnel into the driver’s right eye��, according to a complaint filed with NHTSA.In January, a 2002 Toyota Corolla in Shizuoka, Japan had its air bag explode, sending hot shrapnel into the car. The passenger seat was burned, Toyota has said.NHTSA said this month it was examining whether moisture from humidity could be seeping inside inflators designed to be airtight. That could make the volatile propellant inside the inflators unstable, experts have said.NHTSA is also looking at Takata inflators supplied after 2002. Its probe includes an examination of air bag explosions in a 2005 Mazda 6, a 2006 Dodge Charger and a 2004 Nissan Sentra.Chrysler, maker of the Dodge Charger, had not previously been involved in the Takata recall. The Sentra had previously only been recalled for the 2002 and 2003 model years.Air bags, including those made by Takata, have saved thousands of lives since their widespread adoption in the 1990s, automakers, regulators and safety advocates agree.But in order to work, air bags need to inflate in less than half the time it takes to blink an eye, just 40 milliseconds on the passenger side, according to Takata. That requires the use of powerful and potentially dangerous explosives in inflators which require careful handling and precise calibration.In March 2006, Takata’s air bag plant in Monclova was rocked by a series of explosions that sent a fireball into the air.Takata uses ammonium nitrate in its inflators, Honda has said. That explosive compound is volatile and highly sensitive to moisture. Other air bag makers, including Takata’s larger Swedish rival, Autoliv Inc, have kept their inflator designs a proprietary secret.Takata identified several manufacturing problems with its inflators, including some at a plant in Moses Lake, Washington, and at Monclova, where the ammonium nitrate was exposed to too much moisture inside the air-conditioned plant.The manufacturing glitches meant the inflator propellant could burn too fast and blow apart the metal casing surrounding it, sending out hot gas and shrapnel.The recalls have been most costly for Honda. In May 2009, 18-year-old Ashley Parham was driving a 2001 Honda Accord when she bumped into a car in her high school parking lot outside Oklahoma City. The Accord’s air bag exploded and metal shrapnel sliced Parham’s carotid artery. She bled to death, one of two deaths linked to Takata air bags. Honda and Takata settled with Parham’s family out of court and details were not disclosed.Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategies and a researcher and consultant for plantiffs�� lawyers, said it was clear past Takata recalls, which began in 2008, had fallen short.“What’s very troubling is that they haven’t resolved this thing once and for all,�� he said.In Japan, drivers who began to respond to recall notices this week were sent home from Toyota dealerships with a yellow warning labels on the window visor.“Warning: Passenger Air Bag Inoperative,�� the warning reads. “We recommend you sit in the back seat. If you must sit in the front seat, push it all the way back and use a seatbelt.”Tomoki Nakagawa, 52, said he was stunned to find his mechanic had turned off the passenger air bag on his silver Noah minivan. He was told to avoid carrying passengers, advice that puzzled and frustrated him.“I bought a minivan because I need to carry many people. If there is an accident and the injury gets more serious because there was no air bag, how is Toyota going to respond?�� he said.Toyota took the step of disabling passenger-side air bags after consulting with Japan’s transport ministry, which approved the action. The automaker has told regulators it expects to have replacement parts available around September.“We temporarily suspended the air bag function on vehicles in Japan until the parts are available because (the ministry) requires a remedy at the time of recall filing,�� Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said. “We considered the lead time of remedy parts preparation, and we prioritized the customer’s safety.��	1.885343798
Jan 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is expected to raise its Japan sales outlook for the year by 100,000 vehicles, hoping to cash in on the revival of the eco-car subsidy, the Nikkei business daily reported.Last month, the automaking giant had forecast to see record sales of 8.48 million vehicles, with 1.53 million sale at home.Toyota is bent on selling more green cars this year since the Japanese government has revived the subsidies on purchase of eco-friendly vehicles, the daily reported.The company’s revised outlook, which boosts Toyota’s global sales estimate by 22 percent, includes its Lexus luxury brand, Aqua hybrid and a plug-in hybrid that will debut on Jan. 30, Nikkei said.	16.96416022

Bell holds off Crafton to win truck raceBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeHAMPTON, Ga. -- Christopher Bell unquestionably had the dominant truck in Saturday’s Active Pest Control 200, but in the end, the driver of the No. 4 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota Tundra had to work hard for the third NASCAR Camping World Truck Series victory of his career.In the nightcap of a NASCAR doubleheader at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Bell held off fellow Tundra driver Matt Crafton in a two-lap shootout to the finish for his first win of the 2017 season.Austin Cindric’s spin on Lap 124 of 130 brought out the eighth and final caution of the race and set up the final two-lap dash. Bell restarted on the inside on Lap 129, with Crafton in the outside lane. Crafton held his own through the first two corners, but Bell pulled ahead on the backstretch and finally cleared Crafton’s No. 88 Toyota off Turn 4.One lap later, Bell crossed the finish line .447 seconds ahead of Crafton, with defending series champion Johnny Sauter trailing the lead pair in third place. Ben Rhodes ran fourth, followed by Chase Elliott and Grand Enfinger, who tangled with Cindric to cause the final caution.“I was just trying to do everything I could to get the best restart I could,�� Bell said. “I didn’t want to get my momentum broken. These Truck races are really tough to get restarts going, because it’s so aero-dependent.“You can get all sorts of momentum or you can get all sorts of momentum taken away from you. That happened to me there in the middle section of the race.”But the truck was there when it counted.“It was just a dream machine. It was really, really good.”Clearly, that was an understatement. Bell edged his team owner for the pole position in Saturday morning’s qualifying session and proceeded to lead the first 83 laps, claiming both the first and second 40-lap stage wins in the process.In fact, Bell was so dominant in the second stage that crossed the stripe 8.030 seconds ahead of Busch, who nevertheless took the lead with an excellent pit stop, putting Bell in the outside lane for the start of Stage 3 on Lap 88.Bell subsequently fell back to fifth in the running order, but after two cautions, he restarted from the inside lane on the third row on lap 113 and one lap later passed Crafton for the lead.Busch, who won the NASCAR XFINITY Series race earlier in the day, fell back with a cut tire on the Lap 113 restart and finished 26th, but took solace from the quality of Bell’s effort -- not to mention the progress the 22-year-old has made since Busch signed the open-wheel star to a full-time ride last year.“We’re still trying to get the Sprint Car out of him,�� Busch quipped after the race. “This kid grows up running 30-lap features, and after 30 laps his tires are worn out.”On Saturday, however, Bell decisively overcame the “Days of Thunder�� mentality Busch described, and with the race win and two stage victories, came away with all seven available playoff points in the process.	-4.339739616
JAKARTA, Jan 13 (REUTERS) - Indonesia’s car and motorcycle sales grew at a slower pace in 2011, industry data showed, and growth will likely slow further on expectations of planned fuel subsidy curbs and higher loan interest costs, analysts said on Friday.Domestic car sales hit a record of 894,180 in 2011, up 16.9 percent versus the 57.3 percent growth in 2010, while motorcycle sales rose 7.3 percent compared with 26 percent a year earlier, according to data from the automotive manufacturers�� association and the motorcycle industry association.The sales are seen as a key indicator of consumption in southeast Asia’s largest economy because cars and motorbikes are a highly desirable commodity for the rapidly expanding middle class.Slower sector growth reflects factors specific to the industry and will not necessarily translate into slower consumption growth, according to analyst Gundy Cahyadi at OCBC Bank in Singapore. “It (sales growth) is very likely to slow in 2012, especially since 2011 is still a high-base year but we should note that this may not necessarily mean that domestic demand growth is on a decline. Other factors such as production capacity may play a part as well,�� Cahyadi said.Automotive sales were hurt in the last three months in 2011 as floods hurt regional production in Thailand.A government plan to limit subsidised fuels and the possibility that auto loans could not be much cheaper might discourage people from buying new or used cars and motorcycles, said Juniman, an analyst at Bank Internasional Indonesia in Jakarta.“People will tend to wait until they are certain that their incomes can cover non-subsidised fuels ... The era of declining interest rates may be limited,�� he said.Car sales rebounded in December, rising 14.7 percent year-on-year, after slumping 2.3 percent in November due to lower sales of imported cars.Toyota Motor Corp led the selling, with 310,674 cars last year, up 10.7 percent from 2010. Sales of Honda dropped 26 percent to 45,416 cars.Domestic motorcycle sales recorded their lowest sales in December, falling 10.3 percent to 460,535 motorcycles with Yamaha Motor Corp leading the fall by 42 percent, followed by Honda by at 27.5 percent, according to the data of Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI).“We expect production levels to return to normal by the middle of 2012. According to the latest guidance from auto companies, most except Honda is likely to be back to full capacity in Thailand by Q2 2012,�� said Rahul Bajoria, analyst at Barclays Capital in Singapore.Despite the slowing demand as the market matures, the automotive sector is drawing investment in new plants including from Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co, and General Motor Co .India’s Tata Motor said on Friday it is looking at the potential for manufacturing in Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar.The central bank held its benchmark rate on Thursday at 6 percent in an effort to stimulate the domestic economy as global growth slows.	16.66173862

BEIJING, May 11 (Reuters) - Volvo’s Chinese owner offered to take a large minority stake in the Japanese maker of Subaru cars, an offer - never accepted - that illustrates its ambition to expand business in China and around the world and gain more technology to improve its own cars.Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co offered to buy a stake of about 20 percent in Japan’s Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd late last year through an investment banking intermediary.If the bid had been successful, it could have paved the way for a joint-venture company in China to produce Subarus which currently have to be brought in from abroad.China has been the world’s biggest auto market by volume since 2009.By taking over Volvo and now possibly another foreign brand, Geely wants not only to expand its business around the world quickly but use their technology and auto design and manufacturing expertise to improve its own-branded cars.Whether Geely can be successful in that endeavour also has broader implications for corporate China’s global expansion. Chinese companies have poured tens of billions of dollars into foreign acquisitions in recent years - much of it into resources businesses - but they have had little success digesting and managing major consumer brands.Geely’s interest in Fuji Heavy “sounds like a good strategy,�� said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight.Volvo is a premium brand and Geely’s own brands in China are all affordable low-end brands.“Fuji Heavy could have filled the gap in the middle of product offerings Geely has,�� Zhang said.A 20 percent stake would have made the Hangzhou-based automaker the biggest shareholder in Fuji, ahead of Toyota Motor Corp, which currently has a 16.5 percent stake.The sources said Fuji Heavy never responded to the offer.Kenta Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Fuji Heavy, said he was not aware of an acquisition offer from Geely.A Geely spokesman declined to comment.Fuji Heavy, known for its all-wheel-drive technology, had applied for a joint venture to produce cars in China with Chery Automobile Co, one of the country’s few remaining major automakers with no foreign partner.China requires foreign automakers to partner a local company with a stake of up to 50 percent to build cars in the country for local consumption.Beijing objected to the move since it viewed Toyota Motor Corp, Japan’s top automaker, as effectively controlling Fuji Heavy and pointed out that Toyota already has two local Chinese partners - the maximum number of joint ventures allowed for a foreign auto maker to operate in China.Chery earlier this year announced that it picked Jaguar Land Rover, a unit of Indian group Tata Motors, as a possible joint-venture partner.On Tuesday, Fuji Heavy executives said in Tokyo the company no longer expected to be able to start local vehicle production in China during a five-year growth plan that runs until March 2016, and lowered its global sales target for the final year by 50,000 vehicles.Geely’s offer, according to the knowledgeable individuals, was aimed at overtaking Toyota as the largest shareholder in Fuji Heavy, making it possible for the Chinese government to give the necessary blessing for Geely and Fuji Heavy to form a China joint venture.Geely founder and chairman Li Shufu, who is also Volvo chairman, was willing to reduce Geely’s stake in Fuji Heavy once the joint venture was approved, the individuals said.It was not immediately clear whether Geely had talked to Toyota before extending the acquisition offer to Fuji Heavy. Toyota spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by Beijing newsroom; Editing by Ken Wills and Nick Macfie)	-5.156838143
* Toyota sells record 9.75 million vehicles group-wide* Sales rebound 23 percent on a year earlierTOKYO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp regained the crown as the world’s top selling automaker in 2012, posting record-high sales and beating rivals General Motors and Volkswagen.Toyota said on Monday it sold 9.75 million vehicles group-wide around the world last year, a record for the 75-year-old Japanese automaker and up 22.6 percent from a year ago.The result was in line with the company’s December forecast, and put it back in the No. 1 spot, which it lost in 2011 when it was hit by a wave of negative publicity after a recall crisis in the United States, and a disrupted supply chain following an earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand.Toyota held the global sales crown from 2008 through 2010, but fell to third place in 2011 behind GM and Volkswagen.GM sold 9.28 million vehicles in 2012, up 2.9 percent from a year ago, while Volkswagen sold 9.07 million vehicles, up 11.2 percent.Toyota aims to sell 9.91 million vehicles group-wide globally in 2013, up 1.6 percent from 2012.The Toyota group also includes sales at Daihatsu Motor Co and Hino Motors Ltd. Toyota-only sales hit a record-high 8.72 million vehicles, up 22.8 percent on a year ago.Toyota’s domestic rival Nissan Motor Co said on Monday it sold a record 4.94 million vehicles globally in 2012, while Honda Motor Co sold 3.82 million vehicles, up 19 percent.	7.206161637
(Reuters) - Spaniard Carlos Sainz stretched his Dakar Rally lead to more than an hour on Wednesday after organizers rescinded a 10-minute penalty imposed earlier in the week for an incident with a quadbike.The double world rally champion, and father of the Formula One driver of the same name, finished third for Peugeot in the 281km 11th stage from Belen to the sands of Fiambala and Chilecito in Argentina.That left Sainz an hour and 45 seconds clear of French team mate and 13-times champion Stephane Peterhansel, who finished fourth in the stage won by Toyota’s Dutch driver Bernhard ten Brinke, with three days to go.Qatar’s two-times Dakar winner Nasser al-Attiyah was in third place for Toyota, an hour and 24 minutes off the leader’s pace.Sainz had started the day 50 minutes clear but, despite the top four finishing within 15 seconds of each other, gained another 10 minutes thanks to the stewards.“Carlos now has a comfortable lead and Stephane is covering him in second place. But there’s still a long way to go to the finish and we have to get to Cordoba with no drama, which is never a given,�� said Peugeot Sport head Bruno Famin.Dutch rider Kees Koolen had claimed on Monday that Sainz had hit his machine on a previous stage and failed to stop, with the stewards penalizing the Spaniard.Sainz had angrily denied any contact was made and Peugeot had backed him up.“We appreciate the event stewards looking into this again and re-examining all the documents and other evidence at their disposal,�� Famin said in a Peugeot statement.“We supplied them with a certain amount of data, relating to the speed and movement of the car. They were able to compare that to the tracking and ascertain that Carlos’s point of view was the correct one - of which we never had any doubt.”In the motorcycle category, Spanish challenger Joan Barreda had to withdraw after requesting medical assistance near Fiambala.Australian Toby Price, the 2016 champion, won the stage with Austrian Matthias Walkner on a KTM taking it carefully and staying 32 minutes clear of Argentina’s Honda rider Kevin Benavides.Thursday’s 12th stage is from Fiambala to San Juan with a 375km timed leg and 348km of liaison. The rally ends in Cordoba on Saturday.	-2.00533795
TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Japan’s auto lobby on Friday urged the government and the central bank to quickly implement measures to counter the strong yen, after it hit a seven-month high against the dollar the previous day.The currency has strengthened to under 78 yen per dollar from more than 120 yen five years ago, making it more expensive to export goods and squeezing Japanese automakers�� margins.Car firms also face costly labour regulations, high corporate taxes and an energy policy deadlock after last year’s Fukushima crisis that led to a shutdown of most of the country’s nuclear reactors, the trade group says.“The current foreign exchange level, which is far from the actual ability of the Japanese economy, goes much beyond the limits of what companies can do through efforts to cut costs,�� Akio Toyoda, the head of Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA), said in a statement.“Japan’s manufacturing is facing a great crisis again, and if things remain this way it could have a further impact on employment,�� said Toyoda, who is president of Toyota Motor Corp .The yen traded at around 77.59 against the dollar on Friday, having hit 77.13 yen on trading platform EBS the previous day, after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced bold stimulus measures.To limit impacts from the yen’s rise in value, automakers are shifting production abroad. Toyota, Japan’s biggest car manufacturer, is considering raising prices, including on exports, a company spokesman said on Friday.“Facing the rise of the yen, we are considering various ways to cut costs. As a part of making the business profitable again, our options include price hikes such as for cars we export from Japan,�� said Joichi Tachikawa, a spokesman at Toyota.He declined to comment on the details of the possible price hikes.Toyota, which became the world’s best-selling car maker in the first half of 2012, has repeatedly pledged to continue making 3 million vehicles in Japan.It has recently decided to transfer production of the Yaris compact car for the North American market to France from Japan, and Lexus RX SUVs to Canada from Japan.	-8.379418129
* Car industry contributes about 6 pct of GDP* Toyota, Ford, GM, Nissan and BMW have plants in country* Strike could dent investor sentimentCAPE TOWN, Aug 14 (Reuters) - South Africa’s biggest union for manufacturing plans to launch an open-ended nationwide strike on Monday in the country’s key auto sector in a dispute over pay affecting over 30,000 assembly line workers.The strike in the car industry, which contributes at least 6 percent to the country’s GDP and 12 percent of its total exports, could compound the woes of Africa’s largest economy, reeling from strikes in mining that have slowed growth.“The national executive committee will formalise the strike notice tomorrow for the start of the national strike on Monday,�� Alex Mashilo, chief negotiator in the auto sector for the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), told Reuters on Wednesday.Mashilo said the strike would continue until a wage settlement was reached. Labour has revised its initial demand for a 20 percent increase to 14 percent, well above the central bank’s projected inflation rate for the year of 5.9 percent.Major carmakers in South Africa, including Toyota, Ford, General Motors and Nissan, were only prepared to offer 6 percent during negotiations to replace a three-year wage deal ending on June 30, Mashilo added.Toyota, which reported strong third quarter sales growth, is also the market leader at about 25 percent of all vehicle exports from South Africa, shipping 6,668 units in July.BMW’s South African operations have already been hit by a strike that started last week when 2,000 workers walked off the job over pay. The company has made up for lost production by rolling off more cars at its other factories.A prolonged and massive auto strike threatens to erode some of the recent gains made by the industry as it tries to match a pre-recession historic export peak of 284,000 units in 2008.“The impact would be extensively negative and the biggest issue is a loss of reputation that takes a long time to recover,�� said Thapelo Molapo, chairman of the Automobile Manufacturers Employers Organisation which represents carmakers.Besides the loss of production and revenue, a strike similar to the last one in 2010, which lasted eight days, could send ripples through financial markets.“More strike action will keep negative sentiment towards South Africa elevated and we can see that impact on the rand currency underperforming and investment flows slowing,�� said Gareth Brickman, market analyst at ETM Analytics.South Africa’s mining sector is still trying to recover from a deadly labour dispute at Lonmin’s Marikana platinum mine, where 34 striking workers were shot dead by police almost exactly a year ago, in the deadliest security incident since apartheid ended in 1994.The strike started a wave of wildcat action that slowed production at many of the country’s major platinum and gold mines.	0.235386426

(Reuters) - Texas on Thursday executed a man who was convicted for shooting and killing his 29-year-old wife and his two daughters, as well as his father-in-law and sister-in-law shortly after smoking crack in 2002.Abel Ochoa, 47, was executed with lethal injection and pronounced dead at the state’s death chamber in Huntsville at 6.48 p.m. CST (1248 GMT), 17 years after a jury found him guilty of capital murder, according to a statement by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.Ochoa was the third inmate in the United States and the second in Texas to be executed in 2020. Texas, which executed nine people in 2019, has executed more prisoners than any other state since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The United States is the only large Western democracy to retain capital punishment.On Aug. 4, 2002, 20 minutes after smoking crack cocaine, Ochoa went into his living room and shot to death his wife Cecilia, nine-month-old daughter Anahi, his father-in-law Bartolo and his sister-in-law Jackie, prosecutors said.He then reloaded his .9mm Ruger handgun and chased his 7-year-old daughter Crystal into the kitchen, where he shot her four times. He had also shot his sister-in-law Alma, the lone survivor of the attack.Police stopped Ochoa soon after the shooting as he drove his wife’s car.“Ochoa told the arresting officer that the gun he used was at his house on the table, that he could not handle the stress anymore, and that he had gotten tired of his life,�� court records showed.Ochoa later wrote a confession in which he told authorities he was frustrated that his wife would not give him more money for drugs, court documents said.Several state and federal courts have denied requests for the execution to be halted and appeals on Ochoa’s behalf since his conviction.On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a request by Ochoa to stop the execution.Twenty two people were executed in the United States in 2019, down from 25 in 2018 when the country ranked seventh in the world for the number of people it put to death, behind Iraq and Egypt, according to Amnesty International.	-13.73471969

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automotive components maker Denso Corp 6902.T said on Tuesday that it expects to take a hit of up to 80 billion yen ($719 million) this year if the United States raises auto tariffs, Japanese media reported.

The U.S. women’s national team rallied from an early deficit to defeat Brazil 4-1 at Toyota Park in Bridgeview, Ill., on Thursday to win the Tournament of Nations.Alex Morgan’s unmarked tap-in of a Megan Rapinoe free kick not only put the U.S. ahead 4-1 in the 77th minute, but it assured the Americans the title based on a better goal differential than defending champion Australia (plus-5 to plus-4).Both the Americans and Aussies finished 2-0-1 for seven points. Australia earned a 2-0 victory over Japan (0-3-0) earlier in the day at Toyota Park.Brazil (1-2-0) struck first on an own goal by American defender Tierna Davidson before Rose Lavelle tied it in the 33rd. Julie Ertz made it 2-1 in the 53rd. Tobin Heath scored eight minutes later for the two-goal U.S. advantage.The U.S. is 16-0-3 since losing 1-0 to Australia in the inaugural Tournament of Nations on July 27, 2017.It was an ominous start for the U.S. when Davidson inadvertently knocked in a cross by Beatriz.Lindsey Horan started the comeback with her service inside the 18-yard box to Lavelle, who half-volleyed the one-bounce pass from 15 yards. Lavelle has three goals in 11 international matches.Ertz put the U.S. ahead when she finished what Heath started on the right flank with a crossover move before a pass to the far post.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will reshuffle its top executives as soon as this week, people familiar with the plan say, as President Akio Toyoda tries to dismantle a regimented decisionmaking hierarchy at the world's top-selling automaker.Toyoda, who took the top job at the firm in 2009, has slashed the number of board directors and given more power to executives in key markets outside Japan as part of his effort to refocus the company on quality and manufacturing flexibility after a series of crises.The next round of changes is intended to build on reforms made by the 56-year-old president which have helped Toyota regain its rank as the world's top selling car, and to fend off aggressive competition from its major rivals Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, General Motors Co GM.N, and Hyundai 005380.KS.In the upcoming shift, Toyoda wants to give managers lower down the corporate chain more authority to make day-to-day decisions, freeing the executive vice presidents to concentrate on strategic thinking, according to one source, who asked not to be named because the plans have not been announced.“Personnel moves are announced when decisions have been made. We cannot comment on this matter, including the timing or the content,�� said Ryo Sakai, a Toyota spokesman.The company has seven executive vice presidents who, besides overseeing operations in a particular market or markets, are in charge of one or more business areas such as production control, manufacturing, purchasing and accounting.Toyoda wants his vice presidents to focus more on making broad decisions, according to a person briefed on his thinking.At public events and company meetings since he took helm nearly four years ago, Toyoda has hammered out the message that the firm must focus on making “ever-better cars�� and bringing excitement to its line-up rather than concentrating on shifting units, or short-term financial targets.He wants his executives to have the same focus, people knowledgeable about the matter said.As part of that approach, Toyoda has shaken up vehicle development by scrapping the consensus-based approach that delivered the conservative Camry, and encouraged designers to strike out for edgier looks like the Crown luxury sedan, which has been selling quickly in Japan since its December launch.In the reshuffle, Vice Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, who led the development of the Prius hybrid in the 1990s, is set to replace Chairman Fujio Cho, who has held the post since 2006, sources told Reuters.Atsushi Niimi, an executive vice president since 2009 who oversees Toyota’s two major markets in North America and China as well as manufacturing, is expected to be eased out of that role and into a group company, Japanese media have reported.One of Niimi’s innovations has been a more flexible manufacturing system that would allow the firm to shift output with relative ease after disasters like the 2011 earthquake in Japan, which is being introduced in plants globally.Every year, Toyota discloses executive and organizational changes ahead of its annual shareholders�� meeting in June. In the past two years it has made its announcement in early March.Toyoda was stung by criticism that the company was too slow to respond to customer concerns after a wave of safety-related recalls that began shortly after he became president in 2009.Since then Toyota has won back some of the ground on quality it lost during the recalls. In 2010, Toyota ranked 21 out of 33 brands in the Initial Quality survey by J.D. Power and Associates. Last year, it ranked No. 8.The Toyota group in 2012 sold 9.75 million vehicles, outstripping GM and Volkswagen to rank as the world’s best-selling automaker.	1.962661561
March 16 (Reuters) - Tokyo stocks slid to their lowest in three and a half years on Monday as the Bank of Japan’s emergency pledge to boost buying of Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) by up to double current levels failed to calm investor nerves.The BOJ move, announced in statement after an emergency meeting, came as global central banks step up efforts to combat the widening economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.The benchmark Nikkei average skidded 2.5% in choppy trading to finish at 17,002.04, its lowest closing level since November 2016.The Nikkei’s volatility index, a measure of investors�� volatility expectations based on option pricing, jumped 17% to 60.03, its highest level since March 2011 when massive earthquakes and a tsunami struck Japan.“The market got excited by the 12 trillion yen ($113 billion) figure before quickly finding out a footnote that says it is the maximum figure,�� said Yusuke Ikawa, Japan strategist at BNP Paribas.While the BOJ said it could buy about 12 trillion yen of ETFs, in a footnote to its statement it also said it will continue buying ETFs at around 6 trillion yen annually in principle.“The market is no longer reacting to each step the BOJ is taking, looking at whether any of them work. Rather, markets are reacting negatively because they have lost confidence in the BOJ,�� said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments.“Now it’s obvious that the BOJ has no card left to play.”BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda was to hold a news conference from 0700 GMT to explain the policy decision.Earlier in the day, the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates in an emergency move and its major peers offered cheap U.S. dollars to ease a logjam in global lending markets.The coordinated global actions were reminiscent of the sweeping steps taken just over a decade ago to fight a meltdown of the global financial system, but this time the target was a fast-spreading health crisis with no certain end in sight.More than 162,000 are infected and over 6,000 have died of coronavirus globally. Lockdowns and travel bans spread across the world over the weekend, affecting tens of millions of people.On the Tokyo bourse the broader Topix shed 2.0% to 1,236.34, its lowest close since July 2016.Four-fifth of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange traded lower, with rubber products, transport equipment and electric machinery being the worst three performing sectors.Automakers were hit hard, with Toyota Motor Corp losing 2.4%, Nissan Motor Co Ltd falling 3.5% and Honda Motor Co Ltd declining 3.4%.Elsewhere, Fujifilm Holdings Corp gained 0.8% after the company said it will buy back up to 1.07% of shares worth 15 billion yen.

Sept 25 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor, which has lagged its rivals in battery-powered electric cars, aims to leapfrog that technology and roll out what it calls the world’s first production fuel-cell electric vehicles at this week’s Paris auto show.The South Korean automaker is betting that fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) will be a more realistic future auto technology than pure battery electric cars such as Nissan Motor’s Leaf.Those models have struggled to win over drivers as the batteries are expensive, take hours to recharge and can only drive short distances. Toyota Motor this week scaled back plans for its all-electric eQ minicar, saying it misread the market.A fuel-cell converts hydrogen and oxygen into water and generating power to drive an electric motor. Fuel-cell vehicles can run five times longer than battery electric cars on a single power-up, and it takes just minutes to fill the tank with hydrogen, compared with 8 hours or so to recharge a battery.Hyundai, which has watched Toyota make the running with its hybrid Prius model, wants to jump ahead in the fuel-cell market.But it will offer just 1,000 FCEVs, based on its Tucson crossover, from December through to 2015 in Europe as it looks to more than halve production costs to 50 million won ($44,700).Trade media have put the initial sticker price at around $88,000, a hefty price tag for a brand that made its name with cheaper, feature-filled models.While fuel-cell electric cars may go further, manufacturers still have to wrestle with the high cost of production - double or triple that of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) - and a lack of refuelling infrastructure.“We aim to reduce prices of fuel-cell vehicles to match battery cars by 2020-25,�� Lim Tae-won, the director in charge of fuel-cell research at Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Motors , told Reuters ahead of the Paris auto show.He said fuel-cell cars would overcome the “range anxiety�� - or fear of running out of power far from a charging point - of battery-electric cars if the refuelling issue was resolved.A 2008 McKinsey study of 11 global carmakers predicted as many as 1 million fuel-cell electric cars on Europe’s roads by the end of the decade, but industry experts caution demand will depend on customer acceptance of the technology, government aid and, crucially, the availability of hydrogen filling stations.“The great thing about a battery powered electric car is that power sockets can be found anywhere,�� said Andreas Winckler, managing director of the services unit of Frankfurt trade fair operator Messe Frankfurt Medien und Service GmbH, which has leased both battery and fuel-cell electric cars from Mercedes-Benz since November.“Before we installed the first charging stations here, we just opened a window and ran an extension cord out to the car.”Winckler noted there was just one hydrogen filling station in the entire Rhein-Main region around Frankfurt, continental Europe’s financial hub, but it had been broken for weeks. “That’s clearly the big dilemma with fuel-cell cars,�� he said.Hyundai’s Lim said it would cost more to develop a hydrogen refuelling infrastructure than one for electric battery charging, but each hydrogen station would process more cars as it would take just minutes to fill up.German industrial gases producer Linde is investing tens of millions of euros with Daimler to build 20 hydrogen filling stations by 2015. For now, Germany has only seven.The aim is to bring down the cost to that of a natural gas filling station, around 300,000 euros ($387,500), from around 1 million euros today, said Ulrich Buenger, a coordinator at the European Hydrogen Road Tour 2012, which is funded by industry and the European Commission.In Seoul, Lim predicts fuel-cell will ultimately become the leading alternative fuel technology, though hybrids will dominate during that transition. For now, Toyota is alone in increasing sales of hybrid-electric vehicles, while General Motors, Nissan and others have struggled to live up to the hype with their early battery electric models.“Battery electric car makers entered the market too early without resolving problems such as range anxiety and costs,�� Lim said. “It was a hasty approach. The battery electric cars may have helped raise brand value for a couple of years, but ended up slowing down the take-off in the market.”Hyundai’s production-ready fuel-cell electric vehicle can run as far as 588 kms (365 miles) on a full charge, similar to traditional gasoline vehicles, Lim said, while Nissan’s Leaf can drive only up to 73 miles per charge.Toyota slashed its plans for the eQ to sales of just 100 in Japan and the United States from previous forecasts of several thousand, saying battery technology could not live up to consumer demands. “The current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet society’s needs, whether it’s the distance cars can run, or the costs, or how long it takes to charge,�� said Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota’s vice chairman, adding that fuel-cell vehicles looked to have more potential.“The biggest problem is how automakers bring down costs and how much infrastructure will be in place,�� he said.Hyundai hopes to get a jump on its rivals by offering 1,000 of its FCEVs, overtaking Daimler and Honda Motor, which have leased only small numbers of their fuel-cell vehicles - the Mercedes B-Class F-Cells and FCX Clarity, respectively. By 2015, Hyundai aims to have the capacity to build 10,000 FCEVs, rising to 100,000 in 2020, when it expects the loss-making business to achieve “economies of scale,�� Lim said.Toyota plans to launch sedan-type fuel-cell electric vehicles from around 2015, and predicts sales in the tens of thousands by the 2020s. Nissan is working on a fuel-cell vehicle with Daimler for 2016 and will also unveil a concept fuel-cell sport utility vehicle, the TeRRA, in Paris.GM shifted funding from fuel-cells to push Chevrolet Volt electric car with range extender, but sales have been sluggish.In a KPMG global survey of 200 auto executives, one in five expected fuel-cell electric cars to attract more consumer demand than pure battery electric cars in 2025. Sixteen percent went with battery cars. Hybrids, including plug-ins, provide the best mid-term solution, the survey, published in January, showed.	-1.665183679
HIROSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan's Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T has only a tenth of Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T research and development budget, but is betting it can make the century-old internal combustion engine as fuel efficient as hybrids like its rival's pioneering Prius.The gamble on developing gasoline engines, while others move increasingly towards electric cars, could also show whether a small automaker can survive independently in a high-stakes market for mass-produced passenger cars dominated by the likes of Toyota, General Motors GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG.DE.“People used to say there’s no way a small carmaker could survive unless they find a partner because it wouldn’t be possible to independently pursue costly technologies like fuel cells, electric vehicles and hybrids,�� said Mitsuo Hitomi, Mazda’s top powertrain engineer. “But these may not become mainstream.”Mazda, valued at $13.5 billion and with its roots as a 1920’s machinery toolmaker, has chosen to focus on reducing the energy loss in combustion engines, with technology that is a side-show for bigger companies focused on headline-grabbing electric and hybrid vehicles. The move has already helped achieve big fuel-efficiency gains in Mazda vehicles.Gasoline engines now utilize at most around 35 percent of the fuel’s energy, with the rest lost mainly to heat and friction. Engines also typically operate well below the peak, at around 20 percent efficiency.Mazda wants to improve that to 50 percent at peak efficiency and maintain operation closer to peak levels. A first step would be with a breakthrough technology called HCCI, or homogenous charge compression ignition, Hitomi said.Honda Motor Co 7267.T, GM and others have also been working on the technology for years, but it has yet to be mass-produced.“ONLY OPTION”In an HCCI engine, as in fuel-efficient diesel engines, the mix of air and fuel ignites without a spark plug, but carmakers have struggled to achieve ignition at low and high engine speeds. Mazda has solved that with a higher compression ratio, squeezing the air and fuel mixture further and boosting temperatures in the combustion chamber, Hitomi said.One remaining problem, however, is a loud noise similar to engine knocking caused by overly intense combustion when the torque, or turning force exerted by the engine, is high.Hitomi believes Mazda will be able to overcome this and hopes to have the HCCI engine ready to roll out around 2020, when strict fuel economy standards will likely be implemented in Europe.“This is very hard and we wouldn’t think of doing it if we had the number of people that would let us pursue all kinds of different technologies,�� Hitomi said. “We are here because this is the only option we have.”Hitomi said a car with an HCCI engine could have a fuel economy similar to gas-electric hybrids. That could mean that a Mazda3 kitted out with an HCCI engine could run at about 30 km per liter (71 miles per gallon) under Japanese standards, about a 50 percent increase from its current gasoline engine, and roughly on par with a Toyota Prius.&lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^GRAPHIC: Japan's carmakers r.reuters.com/hak74v^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&gt;Mazda's annual vehicle sales, at around 1.2 million, are barely more than a single Toyota model, the world's best-selling Corolla, and many of its similarly-sized peers enjoy special advantages - BMW AG BMWG.DE is an established luxury brand; Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T is under the wing of Toyota, its biggest shareholder; and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T is backed by the deep-pocketed Mitsubishi group.Mazda, which made its first passenger car in 1960, lost the protection of Ford Motor Co F.N five years ago when the U.S. carmaker, struggling to stay afloat, cut its holding to 13 percent from a more than one-third controlling minority stake it had held for nearly three decades. That stake has since dwindled to just 2.1 percent.At the same time, Mazda was hit by a strong yen that battered the profitability of its exports. In the four years to March 2012, the company chalked up combined net losses of nearly 250 billion yen ($2.5 billion).The company - which loaned part of its Hiroshima headquarters building to the local prefecture following the city’s atomic bombing in 1945 - hunkered down with a strategy to boost fuel efficiency in its internal combustion engines, achieving gains of 15-20 percent since 2011.Together with a series of other fuel efficient technologies it calls Skyactiv, a revamped manufacturing process and stylish new designs that it was able to roll out quickly in its relatively small product range, Mazda has boosted profit margins. On each CX-5 sport-utility vehicle loaded with Skyactiv technologies, Mazda makes $1,500 more than it made on the CX-7, a sister model without Skyactiv.But it still needs to work on cutting incentives. In the United States, Mazda’s average incentive level to date this year is $1,937 as it tries to sell off older models. That’s more than Toyota’s $1,681 and Subaru’s $908, although it has dropped 6 percent from 2009, according to TrueCar.Mazda expects sales to rise 8 percent to 1.3 million vehicles in the year to March and is aiming for 1.7 million vehicles in another two years. But even that hefty growth would still leave it at a fraction of the 6 million vehicles that Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Chrysler and Fiat FIA.MI, once said were essential for an automaker to make annually to survive.For Mazda, the yen’s depreciation in the last year has been a big boost. The company, which exports around 80 percent of the cars it makes in Japan, booked a net profit for the first time in five years in the financial year ended in March.Mazda shares have jumped more than fivefold since hitting a life low of 85 yen in July 2012, and are currently near 5-year highs. It’s the best performing Japanese auto stock over the past 12 months, and trades at more than 2.7 times its book value - the stated worth of its assets - well above the sector median of 1.6 times, Thomson Reuters data show.While Mazda is betting heavily on the internal combustion engine, it’s not entirely rejecting hybrid technology. This month, it will start selling hybrids for the first time, combining Toyota’s hybrid technology with its Skyactiv gasoline engine in the Mazda3.Industry experts generally assign high marks to Mazda’s engineering, but some insist it will still need a partner.Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst and CEO of Nakanishi Research Institute, said Mazda’s limited product portfolio of sedans, small cars and SUVs is risky as it faces tough competition from many big rivals across all market segments.“That may have been fine while they were selling cars as a part of the Ford group, but it’s a reckless portfolio now they are on their own,�� he said.For now, recovery seems to have boosted the confidence among executives to stay independent, and CEO Masamichi Kogai said he is not thinking of an equity alliance.“The entire company is united now and confident in our own technology, our regional production structure and our sales capability. Now is the time for us to show how much we have evolved,�� he told Reuters in September.($1 = 100.0350 Japanese yen)	-5.791352638
(Adds NEC CEO comment, ownership ratio after capital increase)TOKYO, June 25 (Reuters) - Japanese telecoms company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) will invest 64.5 billion yen ($560 million) in NEC Corp to beef up efforts to develop fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies, the two firms said on Thursday.The investment, to be made on July 10, will give NTT a 4.8% stake in NEC as its main network equipment supplier hopes to crack the dominance of Huawei Technologies, Ericsson and Nokia in 5G network infrastructure.NEC and NTT also said they plan to work together on post-5G technologies, including all-photonics networking and computing technologies being developed by NTT.Japan started its 5G service this year, lagging behind the United States and China, among other industrialised nations.Previously state-owned NTT, which has wireless carrier NTT DoCoMo Inc under its wing, has strong preference for domestic suppliers for core networks, as it is involved in government projects.Japan has effectively banned government purchases of equipment from Huawei in efforts to boost national security.But Japanese network equipment companies, such as NEC and Fujitsu, have limited global presence, with little cost competitiveness compared to overseas rivals.NEC CEO Takashi Niino told reporters that the company aims to leverage the latest alliance to boost its negligible share in the global base stations market to 20% by 2030.NTT is actively seeking capital alliances globally in key areas of technology, such as self-driving and smart cities.With Toyota Motor Corp, it has mutually invested about $1.8 billion on developing smart cities.The company and Mitsubishi Corp have jointly taken a stake of 30% in Dutch digital mapping company HERE Technologies.

(Reuters) - Electric air taxis �� known colloquially, if somewhat misleadingly, as “flying cars�� �� could draw millions of investor dollars away from ground-based transportation start-up firms in 2020, according to a study released on Monday.The still-young electric air taxi business “has the potential to significantly disrupt the landscape of urban mobility,�� but still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to the 2020 Emerging Technology Outlook from investor website PitchBook.The research firm predicted that air taxi start-ups such as Joby Aviation, based in Silicon Valley, and Germany’s Lilium Aviation, could draw a record level of venture investment in 2020, despite a lull in funding in 2019.PitchBook values Joby at $450 million and Lilium at $576 million. To date, Joby has raised more than $128 million from investors, including the corporate venture arms of Intel, JetBlue Airways and Toyota Motor. Lilium has raised more than $100 million, with China’s Tencent Holdings a major investor.German automaker Daimler and China’s Geely Automobile are investors in a third air taxi startup, Stuttgart-based Volocopter, which has raised nearly $100 million and is valued at $250 million.Electric air taxis come in several shapes and sizes, and many look quite different from conventional fixed-wing aircraft. Electric motors replace jet engines, and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, designed to avoid the need for long runways, have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.Only a few companies, such as Geely-owned Terrafugia, make vehicles that actually look like cars with wings.Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, especially from city to city, thus relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they will potentially add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.The PitchBook survey notes that the nascent industry, while posing a long-term threat to ground-based transportation providers, still faces regulatory and technological hurdles that will require more time and serious capital to resolve.The potential for electric air taxis to lower operating and maintenance costs dramatically is expected to attract millions more in funding to help offset massive cash burn rates and a lack of revenue.Lilium is said to be seeking $500 million from investors �� more than the total invested in the entire sector since 2009, according to PitchBook.“We need to be in the front row of these opportunities�� to invest in electric air taxi start-ups, said Jim Adler, head of Toyota AI Ventures, which provided funding for Joby.“If flying cars happen, Toyota will be there.��	-0.474571469
TOKYO, April 15 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp announced plans for new factories in Mexico and China on Wednesday, ending a self-imposed expansion freeze to fend off rivals racing to overtake it as the world’s top-selling automaker.Confirming earlier Reuters reports, the Japanese manufacturer said it would build a $1 billion plant with the capacity to produce 200,000 cars a year in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato.Toyota also said it would build its Corolla model there from 2019, transferring production from its Cambridge, Ontario plant in Canada as part of a realignment of its North American manufacturing operations. The firm’s first passenger car plant in Mexico would create about 2,000 jobs, it said in a statement.Burned by excess capacity after the global financial crisis and a huge recall shortly after, President Akio Toyoda paused new factory investment and called instead for making better use of existing plants. Toyota said it was now using about 90 percent of its total manufacturing capacity, versus about 70 percent in 2009.Toyota also used the time to draw up a fresh blueprint for new factories under its latest initiative, dubbed Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), to overhaul the way it develops and builds cars.Its renewed investment comes as rivals Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co steadily add plants as they vie for the industry’s sales crown.Toyota said the Guanajuato factory would be the first designed to TNGA specifications, and that initial investment would likely be about 40 percent less than comparable investments in 2008. The Guanajuato site, which will be compact and have none of the overhead conveyors common in car plants, would be a model for its other factories, Toyota said.To boost efficiency in the region, Toyota said some Corolla production from Ontario would also be transferred to Mississippi. The Ontario plant would then focus on higher-end, mid-sized models along with factories in Kentucky and Indiana, Toyota said.In China, Toyota said it would spend about 52.5 billion yen ($440 million) to add a new facility and third line at its factory in Guangzhou, owned jointly with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd. The line, to be completed by the end of 2017, would start production as needed from that year.The new line would have production capacity of about 100,000 cars a year, and could be expanded if needed, Toyota said.Toyota said it would also aim to make the existing Guangzhou lines more efficient, including through more automation. Excess labour would then be allocated to the new line, meaning no new jobs would be added.	0.3237875953
* Nikkei down 0.4 pct, Topix down 0.5 pct* Toyota reportedly agrees on price cut with major steelmaker* Steelmakers slip broadly (Updates prices through market close)TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell to a 3-1/2-month low on Thursday, dragged down by Wall Street losses, a stronger yen and steel makers after reports that the country’s biggest producer was cutting prices.Bucking gains elsewhere in Asia, the Nikkei ended the session 0.4 percent lower at 19,353.77 points. It slid to 19,351.92 at one point, its lowest since May 2.The broader Topix shed 0.5 percent to 1,592.20.Shares on Wall Street fell overnight after a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to shut down the government if Congress fails to fund a Mexico border wall.The buoyant yen amid a weaker dollar also soured the mood.U.S. political uncertainty was seen keeping the Nikkei capped firmly.“The market is sensitive to Trump’s day-to-day comments,�� said Yoshihiro Okumura, general manager at Chibagin Asset Management.“Uncertainty over U.S. political risks is the market’s major concern now.”Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, Japan’s biggest steel producer, fell 2.5 percent after media reports that it had agreed on a price cut with Toyota due to declining costs of steel making materials like coking coal.The automaker, in turn, was expected to reduce wholesale steel prices for its parts suppliers.Tokyo’s iron and steel subsector was down 2.7 percent. Kobe Steel lost 5.4 percent and JFE Holdings fell 4.4 percent.Toyota fell 1.1 percent as the bullish yen weighed on exporters, but Toyota-affiliated parts makers edged up amid the prospect of lower input costs, with Toyota Industries Corp rising 0.2 percent.Mitsubishi Heavy Industries dropped as much as 1 percent to 414.3 yen, the lowest since November 2016, following a report that the MRJ commercial jet the company is developing had engine trouble during a test flight.Development costs for the MRJ jet has been mounting as the aircraft’s launch has already been delayed five times.Shizuoka Bank rose as much as 3.1 percent after announcing that it would buy back up to 10 million of its own shares, or 1.65 percent of its shares outstanding.Grilled meat restaurant chain operator Anrakutei Co was down 1.3 percent after reports that some customers were hospitalised and found to have been infected with the O-157 strain of the E.coli bacteria.	7.797184103

* Toyota one-two as race enters Sunday morning* Alonso’s number eight car handed one minute stop-go penalty* Engine woes for Button’s SMP car* Montoya off into the gravel at Indianapolis corner (Updates after 10 hours)LE MANS, France, June 17 (Reuters) - Dominant Toyota led the Le Mans 24 Hours race into Sunday but Fernando Alonso’s hopes of winning at the first attempt took a knock when Swiss team mate Sebastien Buemi collected a one minute stop-go penalty that left him a lap down.The sanction for speeding in a slow zone left the number eight TS050 hybrid trailing the number seven sister car by more than two minutes -- a hefty margin with the two cars lapping the Sarthe circuit at similar pace -- with 14 hours to go.Alonso, the double Formula One world champion and Monaco Grand Prix winner who is chasing the ‘Triple Crown of Motorsport��, shares his car with former F1 drivers Buemi and Japan’s Kazuki Nakajima.Britain’s Mike Conway is driving the number seven with Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi and Argentina’s Jose Maria Lopez.Toyota are the only major manufacturer competing in the top LMP1 class after champions Porsche quit the World Endurance Championship last year, and have only themselves to beat.Rebellion Racing’s number three car was third but four laps off the pace.Alonso made his race debut with a feisty two hour and 43 minute stint, after Buemi had led away from pole position, and handed over in the lead.It was Kobayashi, however, who led as the race reached the quarter distance and the light began to fade.There was a scare on the opening lap when Andre Lotterer made contact with the rear of Buemi’s car in the number one Rebellion.Toyota changed the rear bodywork at the first pitstop before making another modification after Alonso’s shift.Jenson Button, the 2009 Formula One world champion, suffered debut disappointment when his Russian-backed SMP Racing car suffered an engine sensor failure and dropped to last place.“You’re never going to get anywhere near clawing that back,�� the 38-year-old said before finally getting out on track. “Even catching the back of the LMP2 field at the end of the race is tough. It’s become more of a test for us now.”Alonso, who is dividing his year between Formula One with McLaren and the endurance series, has been the talk of Le Mans as he seeks to become only the second man after late Briton Graham Hill to win the Triple Crown.The 36-year-old has yet to win the Indianapolis 500, which he led last year before an engine failure, but will have a guaranteed second shot at Le Mans next year with Toyota.Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, who has won Monaco and Indianapolis, is competing in the LMP2 class but went off at the Indianapolis corner with the United Autosports entry dropping to 18th.“I made a mistake and I ran wide at Indianapolis, just understeered off,�� said the former F1 racer. “I just got on the brakes and locked them up and ran out of talent.”Only one Japanese marque has won before, Mazda in 1991, and Toyota have failed 19 times -- agonisingly last year when their two leading cars retired in a night of drama.In 2016, Nakajima was heading for victory when he slowed with five minutes remaining and came to a halt with victory falling into Porsche’s lap.Spanish tennis great Rafael Nadal got the 86th edition of the race started, giving drivers the traditional instruction to start their engines.

Microsoft has a 5 percent stake in the venture.The new organization “will make lives easier,�� said Zack Hicks, Toyota Motor North America’s chief information officer who will serve as Toyota Connected’s chief executive.Among the services to be developed or expanded under Toyota Connected are insurance coverage and rates based on owners�� actual driving patterns; connected vehicle networks that can share information on traffic and weather conditions, such as icy roads; and information services tailored to a driver’s habits and preferences, including monitoring heart rate, glucose level and other personal health data.The new wireless services will use Microsoft’s cloud-based Azure platform. Toyota launched its initial partnership with Microsoft in 2011. Ford Motor Co introduced a similar program with Microsoft a year ago, and BMW AG and Nissan Motor Co announced Azure-based services earlier this year.Toyota Connected will use Microsoft’s cloud technology to develop “predictive, contextual and intuitive services�� to “humanize the driving experience while pushing the technology into the background,�� Toyota said.Toyota Connected also will consolidate the automaker’s current initiatives in data analytics, data management and data services for dealers and fleet customers.In addition, the new organization will provide support for Toyota’s ongoing research in robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as development of self-driving cars.	2.562284788
SYDNEY, April 16 (Reuters) - Japanese shares dropped on Thursday, tracking the overnight decline on Wall Street as dire economic outlook weighed on investor sentiment, with banks and automakers leading the falls.The benchmark Nikkei average dropped 1.2% to 19,315.45 by the midday break. The Nikkei’s volatility index , a measure of investors�� volatility expectations based on option pricing and considered to be a fear gauge, rose 6.5% to 38.62.On Wednesday, all three major U.S. stock indexes fell as the raft of weak economic data and dismal first-quarter earnings reports compounded concerns over the extent of damage from the coronavirus outbreak.In further evidence of economic damage from the epidemic, U.S. retail sales fell the most on record last month, while manufacturing output fell by the most in 74 years, raising fears of a deep recession.Disappointing earnings from Bank of America Corp and Citigroup &lt;Inc C.N&gt; added the worries about prospects for the rest of the U.S. corporate reporting period.Taking a cue from this, Tokyo-listed banks came under pressure on Thursday, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Inc, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) Inc and Mizuho Financial Group Inc shedding between 2.3% and 3.2%.The broader Topix dropped 1.0% to 1,420.12 by the recess, with more than two-thirds of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo exchange trading in negative territory.Highly cyclical transport equipment, non-ferrous metals and sea transport were the worst three performing sectors on the main bourse.Toyota Motor Corp slid 2.2% after the carmaker said it will cut production of finished vehicles at 18 plants in Japan due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Other automakers also faced selling pressure, with Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Mazda Motor Corp losing between 3.3% and 4.1%.Bucking the overall weakness, the index of Mothers start-up shares advanced 1.7% to 723.94, its highest level since March 6.

(Reuters) - Estonian Ott Tanak took the early lead in Rally Sweden on Thursday after winning the opening super special stage in Karlstad.The Toyota driver completed the 1.9km course around a trotting track, and in front of cheering crowds, with a time three tenths of a second quicker than Finnish team mate Jari-Matti Latvala.“This is one of my favorite events and especially this year because there’s so much snow,�� said Tanak.“It’s nice to start with the two quickest times but we know that the real Rally Sweden begins tomorrow,�� added team technical director Tom Fowler.Championship leader Sebastien Ogier, in an M-Sport Ford, was ninth with just 2.9 seconds separating the top 10.Sweden, the only full winter rally on the calendar, is the second round of the championship after last month’s Monte Carlo opener.	-6.138032305
TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Japanese car makers including Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co suspended operations at some of its plants in central and eastern Japan after heavy snow disrupted their supply chains and prevented workers from commuting.Heavy snow hit Tokyo and other parts of eastern Japan on Friday and over the weekend, snarling traffic on some of the most heavily travelled roads in the region.Toyota has suspended operations at four of its plants near its headquarters in central Japan including the Tsutsumi plant, where it makes the Prius, and the Tahara plant, where it makes the Lexus LS, after parts deliveries were disrupted, spokesman Ryo Sakai said.Toyota has yet to decide when it will resume operations, he said.Honda, which stopped operations of two plants in eastern Japan on Friday, resumed operations at one of them on Monday, said spokeswoman Eriko Hata. “If the road conditions are better, we can probably resume regular operations on Tuesday,�� she said.Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru cars, suspended on Monday operations at its Yajima plant in eastern Japan, where it makes the Legacy and the Forester among other vehicles, as well as at its engine and transmission plant nearby, said spokesman Shunsuke Koike.Suzuki Motor Corp has also also suspended operations at three of its plants in central Japan due to parts supply disruptions, spokesman Hideki Taguchi said. Both Fuji Heavy and Suzuki have not decided on when they will restart operations, company spokesmen said.	-7.456140351
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s automakers�� association said on Thursday it hoped that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain its current framework as the United States, Canada and Mexico update the trade pact amid growing trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners.""Japanese automakers' businesses in North America are based on the NAFTA framework, and that framework is based on a three-party agreement,"" said Akio Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) and president of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.“We hope that framework continues this way, and that it remains well-balanced.”Japanese automakers are bracing for the possibility of higher tariffs on the vehicles they ship for the U.S. market after Washington earlier this year launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports.They are also awaiting an agreement on a renegotiated NAFTA, which may come in coming weeks. Both issues could raise the cost of selling cars, one of Japan’s biggest export earners, in the United States.The United States has wrapped up a side deal with Mexico and is threatening to exclude Canada if necessary. Canadian officials say they do not believe the U.S. Congress would agree to turn NAFTA into a bilateral treaty.Most of Japan’s major automakers operate plants in the United States. At least half of the cars and trucks sold in the country by Japan’s top three carmakers are made in the United States.In a statement, the association said it was concerned that U.S. tariffs of up to 25 percent on vehicle imports on the grounds of national security could have an impact on the Japan’s auto production and supply chain.A renegotiated NAFTA could also have an impact on Japanese automakers producing cars in the United States, Canada and Mexico, JAMA said.Toyota, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Honda Motor co 7267.T all build vehicles in the United States, and also produce in Mexico, while Toyota and Honda also operate plants in Canada.Toyoda suggested the possibility that automakers embrace more localized production globally even as waning demand for cars at home clouds the outlook for the future of Japanese production. For years, a portion of Japan-produced cars have been exported overseas.Japan’s government is hoping to avert additional, steep U.S. import tariffs on its cars and fend off U.S. demands for a bilateral free trade agreement at a second round of trade talks with Washington, likely to take place next week."	-6.282513005

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Talk about a logistical nightmare. Delegations from 195 countries, lobbyists, company representatives and the like now have to rethink their plans after Chile’s government pulled out of hosting December’s annual United Nations climate summit. The decision by President Sebastian Piñera followed weeks of deadly protests over inequality. It exemplifies the dilemmas governments and companies face trying to tackle long-term problems when there are also immediate needs.Chile’s crisis began this month after Piñera’s administration increased subway prices by twice the rate of inflation to offset higher energy prices and a weak currency. That sparked unrest among a population already feeling like they were getting too little of the economic pie. At least 18 people have been killed and $400 million of damage inflicted. Piñera has since reversed the increase and sacked half his cabinet.Using price hikes as a policy tool has failed elsewhere too. France’s carbon tax helped spark months of “gilet jaunes�� street protests. So there’s more than a small dose of irony in Chile’s unrest provoking the country to abandon hosting a U.N. event aimed at pushing governments toward a more sustainable, less fossil fuel-dependent economy. Next month’s two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation confab has been ditched, too. That was meant to mark the beginning of the end of a debilitating U.S.-China trade war.Granted, such events can become bloated boondoggles and they cost host nations plenty to stage. That’s hard for Piñera and other leaders to justify, even without the recent chaos, when there are other obvious pressing calls on government resources. But that means giving up on long-term benefits. This year’s U.N. gathering in Chile was supposed to build on the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord.Companies face similar contradictory demands. General Motors, Toyota Motor and others on Monday, for example, put short-term profit ahead of lower-emissions goals in favoring U.S. President Donald Trump’s weaker federal fuel-economy standards over California’s tougher ones. Royal Dutch Shell, Total and their peers, meanwhile, still make more money drilling for oil than investing in, say, offshore wind power.The U.N. hopes to hold the so-called COP25 climate summit elsewhere. As delegates push for action to match the words of the Paris deal, they will at least have a real-world example of the competing priorities involved to fuel their discussions.	1.241429087
TEMPE, Ariz. (Reuters) - The family of a woman killed by an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle in Arizona has reached a settlement with the ride services company, ending a potential legal battle over the first fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle.Cristina Perez Hesano, an attorney with the firm of Bellah Perez in Glendale, Arizona, said “the matter has been resolved�� between Uber and the daughter and husband of Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died after being hit by an Uber self-driving SUV while walking across a street in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe earlier this month.Terms of the settlement were not given. The law firm representing Herzberg’s daughter and husband, whose names were not disclosed, said they would have no further comment on the matter as they considered it resolved.An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment.The fallout from the accident could stall the development and testing of self-driving vehicles, designed to eventually perform far better than human drivers and to sharply reduce the number of motor vehicle fatalities that occur each year.Uber has suspended its testing in the wake of the incident. Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA.O have also suspended self-driving testing on public roads, as they and others await the results of investigations into the Tempe accident, believed to be the first death of a pedestrian struck by a self-driving vehicle.Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, said Uber does not use the chipmaker’s self-driving platform architecture.Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz said the company expects to “soon�� resume testing of self-driving vehicles, while warning that the ongoing risks will affect the industry’s progress.“There will be mistakes from vehicles, from systems, and a hundred or 500 or a thousand people could lose their lives in accidents like we’ve seen in Arizona,�� Lentz said Thursday at a Reuters Newsmakers event connected with the New York auto show.“The big question for government is: How much risk are they willing to take? If you can save net 34,000 lives, are you willing to potentially have 10 or 100 or 500 or 1,000 people die?�� he said. “And I think the answer to that today is they are not willing to take that risk - and that’s going to really slow down the adoption of autonomous driving.”The March 18 fatality near downtown Tempe also presents an unprecedented liability challenge because self-driving vehicles, which are still in the development stage, involve a complex system of hardware and software often made by outside suppliers.Herzberg was pushing a bicycle while walking across a four-lane road outside a crosswalk when she was struck. Video footage from a dash-mounted camera inside the vehicle, released by Tempe police, showed the SUV traveling along a dark street when the headlights suddenly illuminated Herzberg in front of the SUV.Other footage showed that in the seconds before the accident, the human safety driver behind the wheel was mostly looking down, not at the road.	0.4678990565
BEIJING/NAGOYA Japan (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is reconsidering a move to open a new compact car assembly plant in Mexico after company President Akio Toyoda told planners searching for a site to pause and review its rationale, executives familiar with the matter said.According to four Toyota and group executives, momentum had been building for a decision this summer on the expansion, with the aim of starting production of the mass market Corolla in Mexico in a few years. But Toyoda then asked the team to “re-review�� the project by year’s end, the people said.“There’s absolutely no unused capacity lying around anywhere in North America? Installing production capacity to try to trigger growth is the old way that got us in trouble before,�� one of the executives said, referring to questions Toyoda posed in asking for a comprehensive last-minute re-examination.The upshot was that a decision on the expansion is unlikely before the start of 2015, two Toyota executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said.One said Toyota would probably go ahead with the plant, but might scale it down or delay the start of construction.Toyota already has a pick-up truck plant in the northwestern Mexican state of Baja California, capable of producing 63,000 Tacoma vehicles a year, but does not have any capacity for passenger cars.A company spokesman said Toyota had not made any decision on a new plant in Mexico.“We are always evaluating our production capacity in Mexico, and in North America generally, to keep it in line with local market demand, but no such decision has been made at this time,�� the spokesman said.The agonizing over further expansion encapsulates the strategic dilemma facing the 58-year-old company chief, who took charge of the firm founded near 80 years ago by his grandfather in 2009 after a 15-year hiatus without a member of the Toyoda clan at the helm.Toyoda - the “d�� was replaced by a “t�� in the company name when a new logo was launched in 1936 - inherited a broken company that had just posted the first operating loss in 70 years.He blamed the slump and a subsequent massive global recall crisis in 2009-10 on what he described at the time as his predecessors blind pursuit of volume and high margins and sought to refocus on product and quality, placing the company under a three-year global ban on adding new capacity through 2016.Now, with global volumes and profits recover steadily, Toyota bosses are asking whether the time is right to step on the gas pedal again by installing new production facilities.Toyota, including its Daihatsu and Hino units, became the first automaker to break through the 10 million vehicles mark in annual sales in the year ended in March.The company began looking into the expansion in Mexico as its rivals rush to build manufacturing capacity there to lower the costs of vehicles they sell in the United States. Mexico could also serve as an export hub for South American markets.Car makers including BMW BMWG.DE, Kia 000270.KS, Audi NSUG.DE, Honda 7267.T, Nissan 7201.T and Mazda 7261.T have all either begun production in Mexico or announced plans to start manufacturing there.The people familiar with the plans said Toyota was looking for a site for a second assembly plant mostly in the central states of Queretaro and Guanajuato.One of the executives said it was unlikely that Toyota would, in the end, pass up an opportunity to add capacity in Mexico.“Given the high cost constraints in the United States and Canada, we have no choice but to use lower-cost locations in emerging countries to build cars,�� he said. “I have been pushing for this since 2002. We need to build a presence in Mexico, sales-wise and manufacturing-wise.”But “Akio’s desire to put a definitive end to the old ways�� pursued by his predecessors remained strong, he added. That made it likely that Toyota would slow the pace of the shift into Mexico, he said.	-6.301556255

MUMBAI, April 21 (Reuters) - Striking workers at Toyota Motor Corp’s Indian plants will return to work from Tuesday, a union official said on Monday, after the Karnataka state government ordered the company and the union to restore normal operations.Many unionised workers at Toyota’s two plants near Bangalore, capital of the southern Karnataka state, had refused to return to work despite the ending of a lockout last month over a pay dispute.The Indian unit of the Japanese auto maker, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Private Ltd (TKM), had required workers to sign a good conduct agreement before returning to work, which many employees refused to do.Workers can now resume work without signing the undertaking, the union’s general secretary R. Satish said. The wage dispute has been referred for adjudication. The union is also demanding that the company reinstate some suspended workers.A Toyota India representative did not respond to a call seeking comment.

APASEO EL GRANDE, Mexico, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will ramp up production at its new Mexican plant to 100,000 vehicles a year by 2021, marking a major step to shift production of its popular Tacoma pickup truck to Mexico from the United States, the company said on Thursday.The plant in the central state of Guanajuato, along with an older facility near the U.S. border, will bring Toyota’s Mexican production to 266,000 trucks a year when at full capacity, the company added.Toyota said it expects to send 95% of pickups from the two plants to the United States, where the automaker sold nearly 249,000 Tacomas last year, up 1.3%.“Tacoma production will be concentrated right here in Mexico,�� said Christopher Reynolds, a chief administrative officer for Toyota in North America, at an event to inaugurate the Guanajuato plant.“What this means is that the Mexican manufacturing facilities of Toyota will build all the Tacomas that serve the mid-size pickup segment in the North American market.”Toyota previously said it would move Tacoma production from the United States to Mexico as it adjusts production around North America.Japan’s largest automaker pumped $700 million into the Guanajuato site, which began operating last December. Toyota began making Tacoma trucks in 2003 at its plant in Mexico’s northern border city of Tecate, where last year it turned out close to 167,000 pickups.Automotive exports from Mexico fell for the first time in a decade last year, dragged down by weak demand from outside the United States, and industry groups project another drop in 2020.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - The head of Lexus, the premium brand of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, said on Sunday an emphasis on quality had kept it from manufacturing in China.Unlike German peers Audi, Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE luxury division and BMW BMWG.DE, Lexus imports all of its vehicles sold in China, from Japan.But high tariffs charged on imported cars make it hard to generate volume and last year, Lexus sold around a seventh of Audi’s tally and a fifth of what BMW sold in China.Tokuo Fukuichi, the head of relative newcomer Lexus, said at the Auto China car show that he prioritizes the quality of vehicles over quantity.""The German Three have a brand image that they have cultivated over the past century in their long history, but Lexus is not in people's minds like that yet,"" said Fukuichi, who is also Toyota's Senior Managing Officer, referring to Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE.“Customers would leave us if we have any problems with quality because that is what they are seeking in a Lexus,�� he told Reuters.Fukuichi said that Lexus has been considering the possibility of manufacturing in China but no specifics were being discussed and nothing has been decided.Lexus, which was launched in 1989, took nearly 15 years to start manufacturing outside of Japan at a plant in Canada. It still makes much of its vehicles in Japan but last year it said it will also start production in its biggest market, the United States, in 2015.Its choice to import its vehicles into China, Lexus’s second biggest market, has kept prices high. The entry-level Lexus ES, the brand’s best-selling vehicle in China, has a starting price of about $57,700 there, compared to $36,620 in the United States.Other Japanese premium brands have already made a move to start production in China.Nissan is set to start manufacturing its luxury arm Infiniti's Q50 sedan and QX50 crossover at an existing Nissan plant in Hubei province later this year, while Honda 7267.T aims to build Acura in China from 2016.Infiniti’s President Johan de Nysschen said that production in China may initially turn out to be more expensive than making vehicles in Japan because there could be less economy of scale.But overall product pricing would become more competitive without tariffs and locally made parts tended to cost less, he said.“You cannot compete against your localized competition with an imported car,�� he told Reuters.China’s premium car demand is likely to reach 2.7 million cars a year by 2020, which would make China the world’s biggest premium car market ahead of the United States.In 2013, Lexus sold around 70,400 vehicles in China, up 16 percent from a year ago, according to data from LMC Automotive. Lexus does not disclose China sales figures.Lexus unveiled its new NX compact crossover SUV at the auto show on Sunday, which competes with Audi’s Q3 and BMW’s X1."	-0.5338733432
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Steering and braking problems linked to two crashes and five injuries in 135,000 Toyota sport utility vehicles have prompted the opening of a federal investigation, a U.S. auto safety regulator said on Friday.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it has 135 complaints from 2001-2002 model year Toyota Sequoia SUV owners alleging incidents of unexpected vehicle stability control activations resulting in automatic braking of the left or right wheel and unexpected steering pull.A preliminary probe is the first step before NHTSA decides whether to demand a recall. Toyota spokeswoman Cindy Knight said the company is cooperating with NHTSA.Around half of the complaints said a faulty sensor was diagnosed as the cause of the problem, while other complaints report similar symptoms and driving conditions, NHTSA said.Most of the complaints reported an unexpected activation at highway speeds. Some reported the incident as feeling like a “jerk�� to the steering wheel.In 2010, Toyota recalled 50,000 2003 Sequoia SUVs because the vehicle stability control system could activate at low speed for a few seconds during acceleration NHTSA had launched an investigation in 2008 into the issue and upgraded it in 2009. Toyota insisted at the time the issue wasn’t a safety issue but agreed to recall the vehicles anyway.	3.034026465

DETROIT, June 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday received more awards for initial quality from J.D. Power than any other automaker in the U.S. market, as its chief executive officer was grilled by a U.S. congressional committee about safety issues.It was the second year in a row that GM had the most models named with the best initial quality in the annual J.D. Power study.South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co took five awards and was the best overall mass-market brand in the survey, jumping to fourth place from 10th a year ago.The top three brand’s in the study that asks consumers to report problems in the first 90 days of new-vehicle ownership, were Volkswagen’s luxury brand Porsche (VOWG_p.DE&gt;, Tata Motor’s Jaguar and Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus luxury brand.Among GM models to win were Malibu for best midsize sedan, GMC Terrain for compact SUV, and Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon for large SUV.Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power, said it was a turnabout from years when U.S. automakers lagged far behind Toyota and Honda Motor Co as the Japanese automakers dominated the study, now in its 28th year. Toyota and Honda combined each received one top award for its models.Overall, Honda and Toyota are still highly regarded by new-vehicle owners. The study found the Toyota brand as fifth among 32 brands, and Honda eighth.GM’s mass-market Chevrolet brand was sixth.Meanwhile GM CEO Mary Barra will appear before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee to face intense questioning about whether the automaker has a grip on the safety crisis that has enveloped it this year.The No. 1 U.S. automaker has come under fire from the Justice Department, lawmakers and other authorities probing why it waited more than a decade to recall 2.6 million cars with an ignition-switch flaw that has been tied to at least 13 deaths.Sargent said the overall quality of cars sold in the United States has never been better. Lower-priced cars from manufacturers like Hyundai are right up there in terms of initial quality with expensive models from Porsche and Jaguar, said Sargent.Some brands fell in the rankings, in large part because of newly launched models that have yet to work out bugs in new technology, such as voice recognition, Bluetooth pairing and auto systems, he said.Ford Motor Co, which in recent years fell in the rankings because of problems with information-entertainment systems, is no longer below the industry average in the J.D. Power study.“Ford worked through those problems,�� said Sargent, and as an early adopter in bringing new technology into vehicles, helped the quality of information-entertainment systems among all automakers.In general, Sargent said, consumers have more difficulty overcoming design problems than defects.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday asked a federal judge to dismiss a criminal charge against Toyota Motor Corp after the Japanese automaker completed three years of monitoring as part of a $1.2 billion settlement over claims of sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles.The request, filed in federal court in Manhattan, should bring to an end Toyota’s legal woes stemming from its admission that it misled U.S. consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about the extent of sudden acceleration problems in 2009 and 2010.In 2014, the world’s second-largest automaker paid what was then a record fine for a car company to settle the case and reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. That agreement included three years of oversight by an independent monitor, which ended on Monday.Former U.S. attorney David Kelley, who acted as the monitor, declined to comment, citing confidentiality rules.Toyota spokesman Scott Vazin said the automaker was pleased the government confirmed Toyota’s compliance with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement and was moving to dismiss the case.“Over the past three years, we have worked hard in the spirit of continuous improvement to make Toyota a stronger company that serves its customers better,�� he said.In bringing charges, the Justice Department said that Toyota minimized problems, misled regulators and provided inaccurate information to Congress in the scandal linked to at least five deaths.In 2014, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said the case presented a “reprehensible picture of corporate misconduct�� and expressed hope the government would ultimately hold responsible decision-makers at Toyota accountable. “This, unfortunately, is a case that demonstrates that corporate fraud can kill,�� he said.Ultimately, the Justice Department did not bring criminal charges against current or former Toyota executives.The $1.2 billion settlement was the largest penalty levied by the United States on an auto company until Volkswagen AG admitted to diesel emissions fraud earlier this year and paid $4.3 billion in fines.Toyota made significant changes to its safety practices after the recall crisis that briefly forced it to halt sales of nearly half of its vehicles in 2010 and led to company president Akio Toyoda appearing before Congress to apologize.Toyota settled other related suits, including an agreement covering as many as 22 million current and former Toyota owners over sudden acceleration claims valued at as much as $1.63 billion. There are still some individual civil claims pending in California. (Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Jonathan Stempel in New York)	1.653404067

NAIROBI, May 20 (Reuters) - The number of new vehicles sold in Kenya slumped by almost half last month from the same period a year earlier, due to the coronavirus crisis, an industry association said on Wednesday.The industry, which is dominated by Isuzu East Africa and Toyota, said 594 new units were sold during the period, down from 1,127 units sold in April last year.The shift downwards started in March, when the first case of the COVID-19 was reported in the East African nation, as sales dropped to 846 units from 1,049 in February, the Kenya Motor Industry Association said.There are 1,029 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Kenya so far and the government expects economic growth to drop to 2.5-3% this year, down from a pre-pandemic forecast of more than 6%.	8.630775752

OTTAWA/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will build its Lexus NX luxury crossover vehicle at a Canadian plant starting in 2022, the company said on Monday, a decision that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said demonstrated the value of the country’s international trade agreements.The plant will invest hundreds of millions of dollars to produce the Lexus NX and its hybrid version at the factory in Cambridge, Ontario, “supplying the entire North American market��, Trudeau said in a presentation with Fred Volf, president of Toyota’s Canadian unit.Citing Canada’s trade agreements with Mexico, the United States, Europe and Asia, Trudeau said: “We have preferential trade access to two-thirds of the global economy. In fact, we’re the only G7 country that has free trade deals with every other G7 country.”Trudeau, who faces a tough re-election contest in October, said the plans by Toyota, one of the world’s largest carmakers, will help guarantee 8,000 jobs and the factory.This is the first time that the Lexus NX and NX hybrid sport utility vehicles will be produced outside of Japan. The automotive sector is Canada’s largest export industry, supporting over 525,000 jobs, the prime minister’s office said, and Toyota is the country’s largest automotive manufacturer.The announcement is a “counter narrative�� for Canada’s automaking industry following recent bad news from other automakers, said Flavio Volpe, president of the Toronto-based Automotive Parts Manufacturers�� Association, especially in the province of Ontario.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said in March it would cut a shift at its Windsor assembly plant, leading to 1,500 job losses, and General Motors Co said last year it would shut its Oshawa factory by the end of 2019.Plans to assemble the NX in Canada “means that Toyota’s Canadian manufacturing operations are here to stay,�� Volf said, adding that the cars are “the most technologically advanced and the most in-demand cars in Toyota-Lexus global lineup.”On Sunday, Trudeau hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Ottawa. Both touted the benefits of a Pacific trade deal that U.S. President Donald Trump walked away from.Trudeau said he had discussed the project to build the Lexus NX in Canada with Chief Executive Akio Toyoda on April 1.“When we last chatted just a few weeks ago, we discussed the potential of this new Lexus mandate,�� Trudeau said.	-3.114886731

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday that Julie Hamp, its first female managing officer, had resigned following her arrest last month on suspicion of illegally importing the painkiller oxycodone into Japan.Hamp, a U.S. citizen, leaves Toyota about a month after she relocated to Tokyo to become the Japanese automaker’s chief communications officer. Her appointment was part of a drive by the company to diversify a male-dominated, mostly Japanese executive line-up.In a statement, Toyota said it had accepted Hamp’s resignation after “considering the concerns and inconvenience that recent events have caused our stakeholders��.Senior Managing Officer Shigeru Hayakawa will take over Hamp’s duties until a replacement is appointed, it said. Toyota declined to give further details, citing the ongoing investigation. “We remain firmly committed to putting the right people in the right places,�� it added.Hamp was arrested on June 18 after customs officials found tablets of oxycodone in a parcel shipped to her from the United States. Hamp said she did not think she had imported an illegal substance, according to the police.Hamp, who remains in police custody, has yet to be charged and under Japanese law, can remain under detention for up to 20 days after her arrest. That timeframe ends on July 8.Oxycodone is a prescription drug in both the United States and Japan. Bringing it into Japan requires prior approval from the government and it must be carried by the individual.Following Hamp’s arrest, Toyota said it believed that she had no intent of breaking the law.Hamp joined Toyota’s North American unit in 2012 and moved to Tokyo in June.	0.3239171375
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T announced a long-term partnership that would go beyond project-based tie-ups in an industry where rivals are increasingly turning to each other for help.Automakers worldwide are joining forces to cut costs by building scale and spreading the load of heavy investments in new technologies.While Toyota and Mazda said they hoped to collaborate across a broad range of fields including environmental and advanced safety technologies, they stressed that their link-up was also aimed at learning from each other to make more appealing cars.“It’s not at all about scale, or something that can be seen or measured,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told a news conference on Wednesday, likening the tie-up to an “engagement��.“We think we have a lot to learn from Mazda,�� he said, noting the smaller automaker had won many prestigious Car of the Year awards, unlike Toyota.The deal is a ringing endorsement for Mazda, a second-tier Japanese automaker whose spending on research on development is a tenth of Toyota’s but which has won over fans with its sporty, design-conscious cars powered by its Skyactiv series of fuel-efficient engines and vehicle architecture.Toyoda and his Mazda counterpart, Masamichi Kogai, sidestepped questions about whether a capital alliance could be on the horizon.“I won’t talk about the hypothetical,�� Toyoda said, while Kogai said it wasn’t part of Wednesday’s agreement.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Japan's second-biggest automaker behind Toyota, has an alliance with France's Renault SA RENA.PA, the French company owning 43.4 percent of Nissan.Already the world’s top-selling automaker, Toyota is on a mission, led by founding family chief Toyoda, to make cars that consumers would want to buy for reasons other than dependability and quality, which the brand has been known for.Toyoda said he admired Mazda for succeeding in rebuilding itself after a turbulent period that included financial difficulties, which saw it come under the control of Ford Motor Co F.N, and then losing those ties when the U.S. giant itself needed to cash out to shore up its finances.Toyota and Mazda said they would set up a joint committee to work out how to collaborate, and in what areas, in agreements that would go “beyond the traditional framework of cooperation.”The two companies now have technology and manufacturing tie-ups in which Mazda licenses gasoline-electric hybrid technology from Toyota, and will soon start producing in Mexico a small sedan based on the Mazda2, using its Skyactiv engine, for Toyota’s Scion youth brand.	-1.768756796
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump targeted Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Thursday, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world's largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico.“Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,�� Trump said in a post on Twitter.It was Trump’s latest broadside against automakers building cars in Mexico and first against a foreign automaker. The president-elect’s attacks on investments by companies in Mexico have cast a shadow over cross-border production networks central to more than $583 billion a year in trade between the two countries.The value of the Mexican peso has skidded amid fears that Trump’s policies would harm Latin America’s second-biggest economy -- and declined Thursday after Trump’s tweet.Toyota, which announced plans to build a new Mexican facility in Guanajuato in April 2015, said it would not take away from U.S. employment.“Toyota looks forward to collaborating with the Trump administration to serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry,�� Toyota spokesman Scott Vazin said.Trump’s tweet confuses Toyota’s existing Baja plant with the planned $1 billion plant in Guanajuato, where construction got under way in November. A Trump spokeswoman did not return a request seeking additional comment.Baja produces around 100,000 pickup trucks and truck beds annually. The Guanajuato plant will build Corollas and have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019, shifting production of the small car from Canada.The Japanese automaker’s American Depositary Receipts fell after Trump’s tweet and closed down 0.6 percent at $120.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in Japan on Thursday that the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico, preferring to wait until after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration before deciding whether to make any changes.“We will consider our option as we see what policies the incoming president adopts,�� Toyoda said at an industry gathering in Tokyo on Thursday before Trump’s tweet, when asked whether his company was considering any changes to a production plant the automaker was building in Mexico.Automakers in the United States have been slammed by Trump for building cars in lower-cost factories south of the border, which he said costs American jobs. Pressure to curb that production intensified this week after Ford Motor Co F.N scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion assembly plant in Mexico after Trump harshly criticized the investment.Ford, however, still plans to shift production of small cars to Mexico from Michigan, even as it uses $700 million from the planned Mexico investment to expand its operations in Flat Rock, Michigan, and add 700 jobs.During the campaign, Trump criticized barriers to U.S. auto exports to Japan and said the U.S. government did not do enough to open the market to more American-made vehicles.“Until you open your markets, you’re not selling any more cars over here,�� Trump said of Japan in an August 2015 interview with the Detroit News. “That’s going to force people to build in the United States.”Toyota has extensive U.S. investments, operates 10 U.S. plants in eight states and builds more than 1.3 million vehicles in the United States annually.Between 1994 and 2013, U.S. auto factory jobs dropped by a third while jobs in Mexico rose almost five-fold over the same period as lower-wage production boomed.Mexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based, Center for Automotive Research.Based on current investment plans, Mexico’s auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, according to the center, which draws funding from the auto industry.It said Toyota imported fewer vehicles from Mexico than any other major automaker building cars there last year. Detroit’s Big Three automakers collectively exported more than 1.1 million vehicles to the United States from Mexico in 2016, while Toyota sent about 47,000 Mexican-made vehicles to the United States.Trump has also said General Motors Co GM.N could become subject to tariffs on Mexico-made cars for the U.S. market, and that he would like to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed with Canada and Mexico, or scrap it altogether.Trump criticized GM for importing Mexican-made versions of the Chevrolet Cruze, even as the automaker is laying off 1,200 workers in Ohio this month who assemble the car.	-5.677183052
(The following was released by the rating agency)TOKYO (Standard &amp; Poor’s) Oct. 18, 2012--Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services today assigned its ‘AA-�� debt ratings to Japan-based Toyota Finance Corp.’s (TFC; AA-/Negative/A-1+) JPY15 billion, 0.191% series 50 domestic senior unsecured bonds, due Dec. 18, 2015, and its JPY20 billion, 0.306% series 51 domestic senior unsecured bonds, due Dec. 20, 2017.TFC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services Corp. (TFS; AA-/Negative/A-1+). TFS, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp. (AA-/Negative/A-1+) and oversees the management of Toyota Motor’s financial subsidiaries, including TFC.TFC provides a broad range of finance products to customers in Japan. Given TFC’s essential marketing role in Japan as Toyota group’s captive finance company, the ratings on the company reflect Toyota Motor’s credit strength. Accordingly, its ultimate parent, Toyota Motor, has a very strong economic incentive to maintain the company’s financial soundness and competitiveness, in our view, as is reflected in credit support agreements between Toyota Motor and TFS and between TFS and TFC.The ratings on Toyota Motor reflect its strong competitive position, extensive geographic and product diversity, minimal financial risk profile, technological leadership, and close relationships with highly competitive and financially strong Toyota group suppliers. The potential both for overproduction in Japan and for the yen’s persistent strength to prevent continuing improvement in Toyota Motor’s profitability partially offsets these strengths. The ratings also reflect intense competition in the global auto industry.	6.113870844

"DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto sales rose more than 11 percent in January, a surprisingly robust showing that marked the strongest annualized sales rate for the industry in nearly two-and-a-half years.The surge in sales, led by Chrysler Group LLC and Volkswagen of America VOWG_p.DE, was propelled by the growing need for American drivers to replace their aging cars and trucks. Higher used-car prices and low interest rates also helped spur sales, executives and analysts said.“Normally you have a little bit of the December hangover,�� Al Castignetti, head of U.S. sales for Nissan brand, said.“January starts out very slow and you try to make the month in the last 10 days,�� he added. “The absolute opposite happened this year.”U.S. auto sales rose 11.4 percent in January, nearly twice the rate analysts had expected. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate rose to 14.18 million vehicles, according to Autodata, which tracks industry sales and inventory figures.That marked the highest sales rate for the industry since August 2009, when the U.S. government was running the “cash for clunkers�� trade-in incentive program. Most analysts had expected a sales rate of about 13.5 million in January, typically one of the slowest months of the year.""The momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter actually continued to speed up in January,"" Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T U.S. sales chief Bob Carter said during a conference call.The average vehicle on U.S. roads is almost 11 years old - a record - and owners are now trading in older vehicles they kept during the economic downturn.Stable gasoline prices have also helped spur vehicle sales, Ford Motor Co F.N economist Jenny Lin said, adding that the Federal Reserve's promise to keep interest rates low through late 2014 will also support vehicle sales in the future.Sales rose even as automakers refrained from the generous consumer incentives that were the mainstay of U.S. automakers' strategy before the financial crisis. Last January, General Motors Co GM.N offered incentives to jump-start sales, but it has since pulled back from this approach.“The old days of going blindly after market share are over, and most manufacturers are now concentrating on what really matters, which is profitability,�� said TrueCar.com analyst Jesse Toprak.U.S. auto sales, an early snapshot of consumer demand each month, have been a bright spot for the economy, which is in the midst of a slow recovery.Chrysler, now managed by Italy's Fiat SpA FIA.MI, posted a 44 percent rise in U.S. auto sales in January, led by gains for its Jeep brand. VW rose 48 percent to 27,209 vehicles, buoyed by the introduction of its Passat sedan.Chrysler sales blew past some expectations of a 35 percent increase. The No. 3 U.S. automaker also swung to a profit with full-year 2011 net income of $183 million.In the U.S. market, GM ranks first, followed by Ford, Toyota and Chrysler. In 2011, vehicle sales rose 10.3 percent to 12.8 million and in December the sales rate was nearly 13.6 million.GM predicted that light vehicle sales in 2012 would be between 13.5 million and 14 million. Volkswagen projected 13.7 million sales. Toyota predicted a 13.6 million sales rate.Ford expects full-year sales will wind up between 13.5 million and 14.5 million, including medium and heavy trucks. Medium and heavy trucks typically account for annual sales of 300,000.Toyota sales rose 7.5 percent to 124,540 in January. Nissan sales in the United States rose 10.4 percent to 79,313.GM sales totaled 167,962 vehicles in January, a 6 percent decline. GM was expected to show a decline of about 9 percent from last January.Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, reported a 7.4 percent increase in auto sales for the month, spurred by a 60 percent jump in Focus small car sales. Some analysts expected Ford to report a monthly sales increase of up to 9 percent.GM shares closed 1.5 percent higher at $24.37 on Wednesday, while Ford shares fell 0.7 percent to $12.33."	6.572215663
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares continued their meteoric rise on Thursday, scoring yet another record high and further expanding the distance between the Silicon Valley electric carmaker and its traditional auto industry rivals.Tesla shares rose to $2,290 in mid-day trading before leveling out at $2,240, the highest price since the company went public at $17 a share in 2010.Tesla’s shares have risen more than 420% since the beginning of this year, turning some retail investors into millionaires.While other carmakers are forced to invest billions to overhaul their internal combustion engine operations to produce battery-powered cars, investors are confident that Tesla can make the shift from a niche carmaker into a global leader in cleaner cars.Tesla became the world’s most valuable carmaker by market capitalization when it overtook former front runner Toyota Motors Corp on July 1. The company now accounts for 41% of the total market cap of a group of 12 of the world’s largest automakers.(Graphic: Tesla stock rally dwarfs rivals' market cap Tesla stock rally dwarfs rivals' market cap - )Tesla produces only a fraction of the vehicles sold by established global carmakers, many of which are considered growth engines for their local economies.Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE sold 10.46 million and 11 million vehicles, respectively, during the 2019 financial year. That compares to the 367,200 vehicles Tesla delivered in 2019.Tesla has said it would deliver at least half a million vehicles by the end of 2020, less than 5% of Toyota’s and Volkswagen’s annual sales.But Tesla withstood industry-wide fallout from the novel coronavirus pandemic and in July reported a second-quarter profit, clearing a hurdle that could lead to the electric carmaker’s inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 index.	1.560633214
(Adds Toyota statement)DETROIT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators said Monday they are evaluating a petition to investigate about 1.7 million Toyota Corolla compacts for alleged engine surging and brake failure.The request was submitted by an unnamed consumer to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a letter dated September 11, the agency said.The petition alleges that Corollas from model years 2006-2010 may experience engine surges at low speeds, and that its brakes may fail to stop the vehicle in time to prevent a crash.NHTSA said the petitioner allegedly experience “multiple low-speed surge events�� while driving a 2010 Corolla, including one that resulted in a collision with a parked vehicle in June.The petition cited 163 similar complaints to NHTSA from Corolla owners, of which NHTSA, in a preliminary review, identified 141 complaints related to 2006-2010 Corollas.NHTSA said copies of the petition and supporting documents will be posted in a public file.Toyota Motor Sales USA, in a statement on Monday, said it “will fully cooperate with any inquiry regarding the petition.�� (Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Richard Chang)	-1.420913809
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Supreme Court has ordered a temporary ban on the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi to combat toxic smog in the city, prompting concern in the auto sector as some carmakers say they may reconsider investment plans in the country.According to an order passed on Wednesday, the registration of sport-utility vehicles and other diesel cars with an engine capacity of 2,000 cc or more is banned in Delhi and the surrounding region with immediate effect until March 31.Delhi’s crackdown on diesel cars has unsettled the industry, its salesmen and investors, who warn the ban and uncertainty around it could derail a tentative recovery in Indian sales and leave dealers with forecourts packed with unsold cars.Environmental campaigners and the lawyer who brought the case to the Supreme Court, however, say they want to see the order extended beyond the capital to other smog-choked cities.Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, for whom the Delhi region represents almost a quarter of sales in the country, told Reuters the diesel ban and the uncertainty around it would “severely impact�� growth plans and future investment in India.“We also have to consider the loss of jobs that this will result (in) at the dealerships, at the vendors producing diesel engines,�� a spokesman said in an emailed statement, adding its own workers would be affected.The court - which said the order would not hit India’s “common man�� - stopped short of banning the smaller cars that clog India’s roads. But it did also prohibit trucks from passing through the city to reach other states and banned all trucks over 10 years old from the capital.An existing charge imposed on trucks making deliveries to Delhi itself was doubled to up to 2,600 rupees ($39).Other measures include a demand for all taxis in Delhi, mainly those operated by Uber and local rival Ola, to replace diesel with natural gas, as well as a broad, immediate ban on burning solid waste.In January, the judges will also consider an application to levy a green tax on all diesel cars sold in the country.Environmentalists have cheered Wednesday’s moves, but analysts questioned the detail of the ban.“The (higher truck) levy will just go back to whoever is hiring the trucks. So eventually the consumer ends up paying the levy and inhaling the gas fumes,�� said Deepesh Rathore, director at consultant Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors.India’s National Green Tribunal, an environmental court, last week ordered a ban on the registration of all diesel vehicles for nearly four weeks to help clean up the air in Delhi, one of the world’s most polluted cities.That triggered a share price fall among automakers which have invested heavily in diesel technology in India. The drop steepened after the Supreme Court’s order.Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, India’s top utility-vehicle maker, was one of the biggest losers with shares down 5.5 percent. It said the ban would affect roughly 2 percent of its total monthly sales.Rivals such as Tata Motors and Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s top-selling carmaker, also have popular large cars. Greater Delhi contributes 8 percent of Toyota’s sales and 80 percent of vehicles sold in this region are diesel.India’s auto industry body called for a comprehensive plan, which should include a policy to remove and scrap old vehicles.	-11.10058424
LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese car component manufacturers, among the country’s top exporters, are calling thousands of employees back to work even before a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown is lifted as Europe’s automotive sector resumes production.Companies like Bosch BFREN.IS, Continental Mabor, and Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Autoeuropa plant suspended production in March as demand slumped, non-essential businesses were instructed to close and workers stayed at home to care for children after schools closed across the country on March 16. But with carmakers like Toyota 7203.T and Volkswagen announcing they will restart production in Europe in the coming week, the export-oriented industry is tiptoeing back to work, even as parliament voted on Thursday to extend the state of emergency in place since March 18 to May 2.Automaker Bosch, which exports 90% of its output from Portugal to over 50 countries and employs around 5,000 people, has restarted production at all three of its facilities, albeit with just 30% of workers present at its smallest operation in Ovar, a northern municipality badly hit by the outbreak.Continental Mabor, a tire manufacturing factory also among the country’s biggest exporters, re-opened its production lines on Tuesday, with its 2,300 staff taking turns to work in 15-day rotations.Volkswagen’s Autoeuropa plant, the country’s top exporter in 2019 employing nearly 6,000 staff, is resuming production in a similar shift pattern on April 27, the company announced on Wednesday, after a month of suspension.“Clients are slowly restarting production in Europe, and they need parts - so companies are stepping in,�� secretary-general of the Association for Producers for the Automobile Industry, Adao Ferreira, told Reuters.A total of 930,000 workers have been temporarily laid off across the country which has so far reported 18,841 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, and 629 deaths.“Employees are a little apprehensive about it,�� Joao Reis, a worker at Autoeuropa, told Reuters. “There’s pressure to get the economy going again, and we know our jobs could be at risk if the company stayed on hold - but we don’t know yet whether the pandemic is really slowing, and that makes some of us nervous.”Autoeuropa is taking extensive measures to comply with safety regulations, including supplying masks and gloves, ensuring workers keep at safe distance and organising transport to and from the factory, Reis said.The move represents the beginnings of a return to normality in the export-oriented economy forecast by the IMF to suffer an 8% drop in GDP as a result of the crisis.Still, whether factories will remain open long-term is unclear. “Things are still very uncertain and measures are being revised daily,�� Bosch spokesman Abilio Diz told Reuters, declining to comment further.As the curve of new infections flattens, the new presidential decree extending the state of emergency by another 15 days opens the possibility of a gradual reopening of services, as long as data continue to show a slow in the spread of the virus.	-1.840440391
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Global automakers Toyota, BMW and insurer Allianz will license technology from Silicon Valley start-up Nauto, which uses cameras and artificial intelligence systems in cars to understand driver behavior, Nauto said on Friday.Nauto Chief Executive Stefan Heck told Reuters the carmakers and insurer will integrate the technology into their test vehicles and use the aggregate and anonymized data - whether on driving habits, difficult intersections, or traffic congestion - to help develop their autonomous vehicle strategies.The investment by BMWi Ventures, Allianz Ventures and the Toyota Research Institute underscores the auto industry’s demand for smart systems to improve vehicle and driver safety, reduce liability and make fleet operations more efficient, while preparing for self-driving cars of the future.Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the parties will each have an equity stake in Nauto. A third unnamed automaker also invested, Nauto said.Nauto’s current system, used by commercial fleet customers such as San Francisco’s Citywide Taxi, uses a $400 device attached to the windshield comprising a small camera and computer-based vision system with machine learning to collect and process data.The system can detect behavior such as drinking or texting, and warn drivers not to do certain behaviors - helping insurers to assess risk, prevent fraud and reward good drivers.Longer-term, Nauto plans to move away from its retrofit device and integrate its software into new production vehicles, relying on a massive cloud-networked data set that will not only capture how vehicles and drivers perform, but track road conditions and other safety incidents outside the car.Pooled information on both good and bad driving habits, and the myriad of situations drivers face on urban roads, is essential before carmakers can understand how to program their autonomous or semi-autonomous cars.The company received a $12 million Series A round of funding in April.Heck told Reuters in June that corporate investors would get first insights to the technology but no exclusivity. Automakers are free to build their own applications on top of Nauto’s data, Heck said.	-3.384298231
(Adds production period, background on past recalls)TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd , the maker of Subaru vehicles, said it is recalling 539 vehicles in Japan over potentially explosive passenger seat air bags supplied by Takata Corp.Fuji Heavy is recalling the Legacy made from April 2003 to February 2004. It will replace the air bag inflator with a new one, company spokesman Fusao Watanabe said.Watanabe said he could not say how many vehicles would be recalled in the United States or globally for the same issue. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Fuji Heavy will recall about 8,500 Legacy, Outback and Baja vehicles over defective Takata air bags.Five other automakers, including Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, have recalled some 10.5 million vehicles over the past five years in a series of recalls involving both passenger-side and driver-side air bags made by Takata.Last month, Honda, Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Mazda Motor Corp recalled a total of 5.2 million vehicles over potentially flawed Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2002 that are at risk of exploding and shooting shrapnel at drivers and passengers.Separately, seven automakers said they were recalling vehicles in high-humidity regions of the United States at the request of U.S. safety regulators to see if faulty air bag inflators had been installed in their vehicles.

Nov 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is recalling about 160,000 Tacoma mid-size pickup trucks from the model years 2001 to 2004 in cold-weather U.S. states and in Canada because the spare tire could fall off.The spare tire in these Tacoma models is stored beneath the trucks�� bed. When the trucks were made, the metal plate that keeps the spare tire in place was not coated with sufficient amounts of phosphate to retard rust, Toyota said.Two accidents have been reported to Toyota involving vehicles following a Tacoma truck, but they did not result in injuries, a Toyota spokesman said.Over time and in limited cases, corrosion of the plate could cause it to break, causing the detachment of the spare tire, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. said in a statement on Wednesday.The recall covers 150,000 trucks originally sold in 20 cold-weather U.S. states and 10,000 trucks in Canada, Toyota said.Letters will go to the owners of the recalled vehicles in December, Toyota said.Toyota dealers will replace the spare tire assembly, if necessary, without charge to Tacoma owners.	6.50624927
TEL AVIV/PARIS (Reuters) - PSA Group is preparing to test battery-powered cars that recharge with an on-board generator, industry sources said, as the French carmaker hunts for a breakthrough in mass-market electric vehicles to catch rivals Toyota and Renault-Nissan.Sales of so-called range extenders, pioneered by General Motors in the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, will multiply as the gasoline generators become lighter and more efficient, according to the technology’s backers. That could allow electric cars to carry smaller batteries, shedding more weight and cost.Aquarius Engines, an Israeli startup, said a major European carmaker had agreed to fund further development and road tests of its single-piston generator design, declining to identify the customer. But Paris-based PSA, the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, confirmed its involvement.“We are evaluating the technology,�� said PSA Research and Development Director Gilles Le Borgne. “Nothing has been decided yet.”PSA, which declined further comment, is pursuing an ambitious turnaround following a 2012-14 crisis that saw it fall behind competitors on research and development until it secured a cash bailout from the French state and China’s Dongfeng. Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has pledged to introduce 11 new electric and hybrid models by 2021.To meet ever-tightening carbon emission limits, carmakers will need popular, affordable vehicles that draw more heavily on electric propulsion. Demand for pure-electric cars remains marginal in most markets, held back by their limited range and costly batteries, even after significant government incentives.Hybrids like the Toyota Prius, which next year marks the 20th anniversary of its original version’s launch, combine a battery and electric motors with a combustion engine, both driving the transmission mechanically. But fuel savings are limited by the system’s added weight, complexity and cost, making it unsuitable for small mass-market vehicles.Range extenders like the Volt’s 1.4-litre engine or the two-cylinder generator aboard BMW’s i3 offer a different compromise, kicking in to keep the electric motors humming only when the battery runs low. As with hybrids, however, their heft cuts the distance that can be covered before that happens.In a rethink of engine fundamentals, Aquarius has pared the range extender down to a single piston that blasts to and fro inside a valveless 600cc cylinder, generating power from electromagnetic coils with each stroke. It delivers more than twice the overall energy efficiency of a typical combustion engine, according to simulations by German engineering firm FEV.“If the concept works in reality it’s going to have a lot of potential,�� said Pavan Potluri, a powertrain analyst with industry consulting firm IHS Automotive.“But vehicle manufacturers are always very risk-averse, so the biggest challenge may be getting one to sign up to it.”PSA has some risk-taking form. In 2013 it developed a fuel-efficient “Hybrid Air�� system with Bosch and was ready to take the pneumatic-hydraulic drivetrain into production, but failed to find another manufacturer willing to split the investment.According to Aquarius, several prototype vehicles using its free-piston generator will be road-tested by the carmaker client early in 2017.At an estimated $17,000 per vehicle, costs should undercut both conventional hybrids that come in closer to $25,000 and pure-electrics at around $40,000, the private company projects.“Aquarius offers an alternative to a 100-percent electric vehicle,�� advisory board member Efraim Wasservogel said. With ultra-low emissions, it reduces the required quantity of battery cells “that no one knows how to recycle��, he added.Not everyone is convinced. Many industry leaders believe adding a combustion engine harms the zero-emissions appeal of electric cars as well as their eligibility for green incentives.While more than half of BMW’s i3 customers opted for a range extender with the original model, that proportion is “substantially lower�� since a revamp improved battery range, the company said. Toyota unveiled its own free-piston generator design in 2014 but has yet to announce plans for the technology.Renault, a first-mover in the current generation of electric cars with alliance partner Nissan, has its own prototype two-stroke range extender and no intention of using it, according to a senior alliance engineer.The carmaker, PSA’s domestic rival, had also reviewed the Aquarius kit and decided to pass, he said.Instead, Renault-Nissan is pinning its hopes for electric cars on future improvements in battery performance and cost, alliance Senior Vice President Arnaud Deboeuf said recently.“We’re going to extend their range,�� Deboeuf said. “But we’ll do it without range extenders.��	8.890535284
BEIJING, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will launch two China-only brands through its two Chinese joint ventures starting next year, a senior executive said on Thursday.Toyota makes cars in partnership with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co.Hiroji Onishi, Toyota’s senior managing Officer, did not say which venture will roll out its China-only brand first.Rivals Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co are among other foreign automakers that also have China-only brands.	6.50624927
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's GM.N global sales rose almost 4 percent in the first six months of the year as strong demand in the United States and China outweighed sliding sales in Europe, the company said on Tuesday.The No. 1 U.S. automaker sold more than 4.85 million cars and light trucks in the first half as demand rose at least 7 percent in each of its two largest regions - International Operations, which includes China, and North America.The results kept GM ahead of Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in the race for bragging rights as the world's largest automaker. VW reported last week that its six-month sales rose 5.5 percent to 4.7 million vehicles.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, which sold the most cars globally last year, has not yet released its first-half global sales figures.Last year, Toyota took back the title of world’s largest automaker from GM as the Japanese automaker’s 9.75 million sales topped GM (9.28 million) and VW (9.07 million). Toyota held the global sales crown from 2008 through 2010 but fell to third place in 2011 due to negative publicity after a U.S. recall crisis and a disrupted supply chain following an earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand.GM's smaller U.S. rival, Ford Motor Co F.N, is due to release its six-month global sales figures later this month.GM’s International Operations, including the world’s largest auto market, China, had a first-half sales rise of 7 percent to almost 1.92 million vehicles. In China, where GM is the market-share leader, sales jumped almost 11 percent to a record 1.57 million vehicles.Sales in North America increased 7.7 percent to more than 1.64 million vehicles. U.S. sales rose 8 percent to 1.42 million.Sales fell 6.5 percent in Europe to more than 797,000 vehicles, and were down 1 percent in South America to almost 497,000.GM said its mainstream Chevrolet brand had a 1.4 percent rise in first-half global sales, to 2.5 million cars and trucks. Chevy sales rose in its three largest markets: the United States (up 5.6 percent to more to more than 1 million vehicles), China (up 6.1 percent to 322,000) and Brazil (up 5.1 percent to 305,000).For VW, sales of its namesake brand rise 4.4 percent globally to 2.91 million vehicles in the first half.	-1.49801284
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Wednesday it aims to sell a car with automated highway driving functions around 2020, joining the race to market self-driving vehicles that pits traditional automakers against tech firms like Google.Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co have also set 2020, the year of the Tokyo Olympics, as the target date to bring self-driving cars to market.A spokesman for Japan’s No. 3 automaker declined to give details about the vehicle’s planned capabilities ahead of next week’s Tokyo Motor Show, where other Japanese automakers are expected to show “robot car�� prototypes to the public.As writing lines of code becomes as vital to car making as developing efficient motors, traditional automakers are worried they could be outflanked by Google, which is currently testing a prototype driverless car, or Apple, which is exploring building a car and is studying self-driving technology.	-0.02425222312
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s auto sales in July climbed 16.4% from a year earlier, the fourth consecutive month of gains as the world’s biggest vehicle market comes off lows hit during the country’s coronavirus lockdown.Sales rose to 2.11 million vehicles in July but are still down 12.7% for the year to date at 12.37 million vehicles, according to wholesale sales data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).The association expects auto sales to fall around 10% this year barring a second wave of virus infections which could deepen the slide to around 20%.In a promising sign for many global automakers which have invested heavily in electric vehicles for the China market, sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) ended 12 straight months of decline with a 19.3% jump to 98,000 units.“The sales growth shows NEV makers and customers are getting used to the new normal after the government cut subsidies last year,�� said Xu Haidong, a senior CAAM official.CAAM expects NEV sales of 1.1 million vehicles this year, a drop of around 11% from last year.NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.Sales of trucks and other commercial vehicles, which constitute around a quarter of the market, surged 59.4%, driven by government investment in infrastructure as well as tougher emission rules introduced this year. Sales of passenger vehicles rose 8.5%.Automakers which have reported sales growth in July include Great Wall Motor Co Ltd 601633.SS, Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175.HK and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.Haitong International analyst Shi Ji said that current levels of inventory in the industry seemed high, which could prompt dealers to offer bigger discounts.	-2.669158879

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T said on Thursday they will invest $2.3 billion in a new joint venture factory in Alabama, $830 million more than announced in their original plan in 2018.Production is expected to start next year building up to 150,000 future Mazda crossover vehicles and 150,000 Toyota sport utility vehicles annually. The Japanese automakers are expected to receive $97 million in additional tax incentives for the added investment, a person briefed on the matter said.The automakers have faced challenges as they continued construction work during the coronavirus pandemic on the plant, which will now cost about 50% more than first estimated.The companies said the higher investment “accommodates production line enhancements made to improve manufacturing processes.”The plant continues to target up to 4,000 new jobs and has hired approximately 600 employees to date.“Mazda and Toyota’s increased commitment to the development of this manufacturing plant reiterates their belief in the future of manufacturing in America and the potential for the state of Alabama to be an economic leader in the wake of unprecedented economic change,�� Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said in a statement.The companies said the plant’s roofing, siding, floor slabs, ductwork, fire protection and electrical work is 75% to 100% complete.State and local governments in Alabama previously provided more than $700 million in tax incentives.In September, President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a limited trade deal that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products but delayed the question of auto imports for future talks.Trump threatened hikes but did not raise current auto tariffs of 2.5% on passenger vehicles and 25% on pickup trucks.Japan exported 1.7 million vehicles last year to the United States, making up about 10% of U.S. vehicle sales.	-0.3352704515
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will focus on fully utilising production capacity at its plants in India, after a report that it would halt expansion due to high taxes.Taxes on cars sold in India are as high as 28% and after additional levies can rise to up to 50% for some models.“The message we are getting, after we have come here and invested money, is that we don’t want you,�� Bloomberg quoted Shekhar Viswanathan, vice chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, as saying on Tuesday.“We won’t exit India, but we won’t scale up,�� Viswanathan said, in the absence of any reforms.Toyota Kirloskar Motors said in a statement it is committed to the Indian market after Viswanathan also said punitive taxes discourage foreign investment, erode automakers�� margins and make the cost of launching new products “prohibitive��.The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has urged the government to cut the tax on cars, motorbikes and buses to 18% to help boost sales that have been hit further during the coronavirus pandemic.India’s minister for heavy industries Prakash Javadekar said on Twitter that the automaker’s chairman Vikram Kirloskar has said that Toyota will invest more than 20 billion rupees ($272 million) in India over the next 12 months.Toyota has capacity to produce more than 400,000 vehicles a year at two plants in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, but data shows it made just over 100,000 cars last fiscal year.	-2.529284489
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday said its luxury Lexus brand suffered its first fall in half-year global sales in six years as demand for its sedans tumbled in the United States, its biggest market.Sedans, traditionally a mainstay for automakers including Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T, have fallen out of favor in their key U.S. market in past years, sending many carmakers scrambling to manufacture more larger vehicles including SUVs and trucks.Toyota said it sold 305,169 Lexus vehicles worldwide in the six months to June, down 4.4 percent from 319,275 vehicles a year earlier. Sales slumped 10 percent in the United States, which comprises nearly half of Lexus’s global sales, and 23 percent in Japan, while jumping 30 percent in China.“The U.S. passenger car market has been very challenging, and this has affected sales,�� Toyota spokesman Maki Niimi said.He added that the automaker expects annual sales to slide about 4.0 percent this year to around 650,000 units, as the recently launched LC sports coupe model and a revamped version of its marquee LS sedan model later this year lift sales slightly in the coming months.While Lexus continues to enjoy solid U.S. sales of its NX SUV crossover model, analysts said that the brand overall had fallen behind rival luxury brands with newer sedan offerings including Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Mercedes, which recently launched its E-Class range, and BMW's BMWG.DE 5-series.“It’s a model cycle issue,�� said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities. “You have two core competing products recently launched (by Mercedes and BMW), while the LS is pretty long in the tooth.”Lexus sold just 1,855 units of its LS 460 model in the United States in January-June, down 35.2 percent from a year earlier.Overall, Toyota, the world’s second-biggest automaker, expects to sell 10.25 million vehicles globally this year, down a touch from last year.	7.749176093
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Friday that U.S. imports of its automobiles and auto parts are not an impediment to U.S. security and will not become one, and import restrictions would have “devastating effects�� on the U.S. and global economies.The Japanese warning, issued in a statement, echoed the warning of two major auto trade groups on Wednesday, which said imposing tariffs would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs and dramatically increase car prices.The U.S. administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose tariffs.“The trade relationship with Japan, an ally, contributes not only to the economic prosperity of the U.S. but also to its security,�� the Japanese government said in a statement, adding that its comments were being submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce.“The import of automobiles and auto parts from Japan has not by any means been an impediment to the security of the U.S., and will not become one.”Trump has made the tariffs a key part of his economic message and repeatedly lamented the U.S. auto sector trade deficit, particularly with Germany and Japan.Some aides have suggested that the effort is a way to try to pressure Canada and Mexico into making more concessions in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.A coalition representing major automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG, BMW AG, and Hyundai Motor Co, said on Wednesday the tariffs would harm automakers and U.S. consumers.Toyota USA added in a separate statement that even a Toyota Camry built in the United States would face $1,800 in increased costs.“Japanese auto-related companies have played a vital role in supporting the growth of the U.S. manufacturing base since starting business in the U.S. in the 1980s,�� the Japanese government said.“Any trade restriction measures ... if imposed, could seriously affect more than 1.5 million jobs created by Japanese auto-related companies in the U.S., and, by inflicting costs on the consumers, lead to devastating effects on the U.S. and global economy.”U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week U.S. investigation would likely be wrapped up by late July or August.

June 18 (Reuters) - Some 1.4 million Toyota Motor Corp vehicles are being scrutinized more closely by U.S. safety regulators looking for possible increased fire risk, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Monday.The expanded probe includes the manufacturer’s best-selling Camry sedan from model years 2007 to 2009.The probe was upgraded to an engineering analysis from a preliminary investigation, which may lead to an eventual recall. Often engineering analyses are closed without a recall.Fires have been reported at a high rate for Toyota models built from September 2006 to August 2008 that all have the same power window master switch design, the NHTSA said on its website.Nine injuries and 161 crashes or fires have been reported to either NHTSA or Toyota, but no deaths, NHTSA said. NHTSA reported there were another 49 warranty claims of fires or “thermal events�� among the affected vehicles.The expanded probe affects the 2007-2009 model year Camry, Camry Hybrid, RAV4 and Yaris vehicles, as well as 2008 Highlander Hybrid SUV.In February, an investigation was opened by NHTSA into about 830,000 model year 2007 Camry and RAV4 vehicles.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian automakers should reduce royalty payments to foreign partners to bring down costs instead of seeking tax cuts, a finance ministry official said on Thursday, days after reports that Toyota would halt expansion in the country due to high taxes.Having suffered a 50% fall in passenger vehicle sales in the five months through August as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, automakers have lobbied the government to lower taxes.But on Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp, the world’s biggest carmaker, issued a statement saying it is committed to the Indian market after a senior executive at its local unit said the automaker would not scale up in the country if taxes remain high.The Japanese automaker issued another statement earlier on Thursday saying it plans to invest more than $272 million in India over coming years.Taxes on cars sold in India are as high as 28% and after additional levies can rise to up to 50% for some models.The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has urged the government to cut the tax on cars, motorbikes and buses to 18% while warning that it would take three to four years for sales to return to their peak levels of 2018.India’s tax policy on automobiles has been quite consistent for the last three decades in the form of allowing foreign investment and incentivising local manufacturing by providing reasonable protection from imports, said the finance ministry official, who did not want to be named.Automakers in India are accustomed to the country’s regulatory and taxation environment and have flourished in this regime, the official said, adding that this is evident from “the huge payouts in the form of royalty�� made to their parent companies abroad.India’s commerce minister told representatives of automakers in the country that they should find ways to reduce royalty payments to foreign parent companies, Reuters reported last month.Representatives of Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest carmaker, and Toyota were among those that met with the minister.Maruti Suzuki paid 38.2 billion rupees as royalty to its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor in the fiscal year ending March 31, amounting to 5% of its revenue, according to its annual report. While Toyota’s India arm paid $88 million or 3.4% of revenue to its Japanese parent, government data shows.	-2.510242086
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Austrian Hans Dieter Poetsch, Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE finance chief, faces a massive task in his future role as chairman - to maintain the support of the often divided stakeholders who have chosen to back him while improving the carmaker's profitability.Although Volkswagen Group has grown to become the world’s largest carmaker it has proven to be one of the most difficult companies to manage as radical reforms can be blocked by labour representatives, who hold half the seats on the supervisory board, and its home state of Lower Saxony, which controls a 20 percent stake in the company.Poetsch, who has been VW’s chief financial officer for 13 years, was chosen as chairman on Thursday because he is seen as a relatively neutral and unthreatening figure.Unlike some other senior VW engineers, he has avoided becoming seen as too beholden to ousted former chairman Ferdinand Piech or Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn.Poetsch’s gentle demeanour should help him mend fences at VW which has been rocked by the clash between Piech and Winterkorn, but analysts and observers wonder whether a consensus-oriented approach is what VW needs right now.Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, professor of automotive industry economics at the University of Duisburg Essen, said Poetsch, a former chief executive of automotive paintshop systems manufacturer Duerr DUEG.DE, was a bad choice.“He’s nice, approachable. He’s good to go out for a drink or a bite to eat with. He’s not the type who likes conflict,�� Dudenhoeffer said. “He’s a stop-gap because they couldn’t find a strong external candidate.”However, Volkswagen’s belief that it makes the best cars in the world is seen as having led it to a German-centric, top-down management approach that has prevented it from developing cars that meet the tastes of Chinese and American consumers.“Peace is the worst thing that can happen to VW. That means ‘keep going in the same direction��,�� Dudenhoeffer said.Piech, the departed industrial scion and grandson of Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche, was no stranger to conflict and radical decisions.For years, he managed the balance of power between powerful labour representatives, senior VW managers and shareholders, sometimes by ousting his own staff, as in the case of former CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder.Meanwhile, Poetsch worked in the background, ensuring that Volkswagen Group had the financial means to absorb bold acquisitions masterminded by his fellow Austrian, Piech, such as the purchase of truck makers MAN MANG.DE and Scania SVKBF.PK, sportscar maker Porsche and motorbike maker Ducati [DUMTG.UL]. Now he faces the task of reining in some of VW’s bloated operations to boost profits, even if that means making himself unpopular at headquarters by cutting jobs at home.“He has a clear understanding of the key financial problems the group is facing,�� said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, welcoming the appointment.After years of chasing growth VW overtook Toyota 7203.T as the world's largest carmaker earlier this year, delivering 5.04 million vehicles in the January to June period, ahead of Toyota's 5.02 million, but it did so far less efficiently.In the quarter ended June 30, Toyota had 342,872 employees. In contrast, Volkswagen has 597,800 staff, according to quarterly results.A former head of group controlling at BMW, Poetsch also has plenty of insight into engineering processes, having studied industrial engineering at the Technical University in Darmstadt before spending his entire career in finance.Given his focus on the numbers, and his success in integrating Porsche, VW’s rival factions threw their backing behind Poetsch to hold the role as chairman, a post which casts the deciding vote on any restructuring decisions.“His appointment lays the foundations for a trusting relationship between the management and supervisory board,�� Lower Saxony premier Stephan Weil said in a statement. “The naming of Poetsch is a good decision for Volkswagen and therefore also for Lower Saxony.��(This story has been refiled to correct punctuation in first sentence)	4.995708155
(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp leader Masayoshi Son has much bigger ambitions for transportation than simply seeing his investment in Uber Technologies Inc turn into more than $13 billion when the company goes public next month.The Japanese entrepreneur is placing a $60 billion bet in more than 40 companies in a bid to steer the $3 trillion global automotive industry now dominated by vehicles people own and drive to a spectrum of transportation services available at the touch of a smartphone app. Those services range from ride hailing and car sharing to delivery robots and self-driving vehicles.The extent of those investments, based on a Reuters analysis of publicly available data and interviews with a dozen sources familiar with SoftBank’s investment strategy, has not previously been reported. They show how Son has emerged as one of the power players trying to influence how people and goods move about the world in the coming decades.Graphic: Softbank's future mobility investments, click tmsnrt.rs/2UQXn4FKey partners in Son’s quest are Uber, the U.S. ride services leader, and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp.Uber’s planned initial public stock offering in May is expected to value the company at $90 billion to $100 billion, representing a potential windfall to SoftBank, which put $8 billion into Uber for a 15 percent stake in January 2018. The rising value of that investment will further supercharge Son’s growing clout in the sector, and eventually provide him with additional capital to invest in mobility.Closer to home, Toyota approached Son more than a year ago about a partnership, and SoftBank in February 2018 signed a memorandum of understanding with the automaker to consider how they might jointly develop mobility services, according to sources familiar with the document. The agreement was followed by the launch of a joint venture dubbed Monet Technologies, designed to set up automated mobility services.SoftBank and Toyota are also in talks to co-lead a $1 billion investment in Uber’s self-driving unit, Reuters reported in March. While the deal is close to being finalized, discussions remain ongoing around issues such as how much of the unit SoftBank would control, sources told Reuters.Toyota declined to comment for this story.In an interview with Reuters, SoftBank Group Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure said that the two Japanese companies “have a lot sessions in which we think and we try to redefine the future of mobility.”Central to those sessions are discussions about how Toyota and SoftBank can collaborate to bring autonomous vehicles to Japan, he said.Son has been working since 2014 to weave together a tapestry of diverse transportation bets. His deep portfolio of investments range literally from A to Z: From Arm, a British semiconductor maker that Son acquired in 2016 for $32 billion, to Zume Pizza, a Silicon Valley startup that aims to automate pizza delivery and raised $375 million last year from SoftBank.SoftBank has used at least five investment vehicles, including the $100 billion Vision Fund, from which to make its mobility investments, public records show. Its deep pockets, aggressive investing tactics and sweeping vision of the future of transportation give SoftBank and its leader Son an outsized influence in shaping the entire industry.The Vision Fund has more than 30 investment professionals who work to promote cooperation and integration among the portfolio companies, which they refer to as a “family.”�We can create this web where companies talk to each other and they help each other because they are part of the same family and they do joint ventures and they do joint investments,�� Claure said.SoftBank and its affiliates have focused some of their biggest investments on self-driving firm Cruise, a unit of GM, and four global ride-services giants �� Uber, Didi Chuxing, Ola and Grab. SoftBank is the largest shareholder in the four ride-services companies and the largest outside shareholder in Cruise.Son “is the true emperor of future mobility,�� said Tom De Vleesschauwer, senior director of long-term planning and sustainability at IHS Automotive.To help implement his vision, Son also allied with General Motors Co and Honda Motor Co, each of which is investing heavily in self-driving vehicles and ride services.Son laid out his future of transportation vision in an October press conference alongside Toyota, where he talked about building a “cluster�� of leading mobility companies in different sectors, which “can collaborate with each other.”Toyota a year ago introduced e-Palette, an electric shuttle designed for self-driving ride and delivery services, and quickly signed up Uber and Didi as development partners. The e-Palette is also the centerpiece of Monet Technologies, which added Honda as a minority partner in March. All are tied back to SoftBank.That collaboration is expected to enable some SoftBank companies to become “superapps,�� or applications where customers go for a range of services, such as transportation, shopping and payments. Such companies can be much more lucrative than those that offer just one core business or service.But the fact that many of SoftBank’s companies are rivals can complicate the investor’s ambitions. Uber and Ola, the Indian ride-hailing company, remain fierce competitors and are never in the same room when SoftBank discusses ride-hailing strategies, Claure said.Traditionally in venture capital, funds do not invest in direct competitors.“There are tremendous synergies, but on the other hand there is significant risk of tremendous conflicts of interest,�� said Paul Asel, managing partner at NGP Capital and a longtime mobility investor.There are limits to the investor’s influence, however. For example, SoftBank encouraged Cruise to acquire or take a stake in self-driving startup Nuro, but talks between the companies never led to a deal, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.So SoftBank made its own, $940 million investment in Nuro.In his five-year transportation push, Son’s stakes in ride services startups now look like bargains. In late 2014, SoftBank joined Alibaba, China’s internet giant in which SoftBank also has a stake, in a $600 million funding round in Kuaidi Dache, the forerunner of China’s Didi.That investment has grown to more than $11 billion in Didi, in which SoftBank now holds more than 20 percent.SoftBank’s partnerships with major automakers are also proving to be a boon to transportation startups. Toyota invested in Uber in 2016, then boosted its stake seven months after SoftBank’s investment. Honda followed SoftBank with an investment into Grab, and last year committed $2.75 billion to Cruise’s self-driving project, aiding SoftBank’s ambitions.But the SoftBank portfolio is not without risks, particularly for companies dependent on the Japanese firm to sustain them financially for years to come. SoftBank faces financial pressures, including an obligation to pay an annual 7 percent dividend on a portion of the invested capital and has burnt through the majority of the Vision Fund.And it is compelled by a new U.S. law cracking down on foreign investment in technology to submit many of its mobility investments to a government regulatory agency for approval. Should that regulatory group block a deal, it could be catastrophic to a startup.But there is some safety for Son given the size of his portfolio.“He’s shooting for big game,�� Roger Lanctot, global automotive practice director at Strategy Analytics, said of Son. “He only needs to bag one or two and he will do just fine.��	-3.382352941
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co, an early mover in the electric vehicle market, will use the Los Angeles auto show next week to send a message about gasoline-fueled engines: They’re not dead yet.Shinichi Kiga, head of Nissan’s gasoline engine project group, told Reuters the Japanese automaker is resolved to keep improving internal combustion technology to prolong its usefulness for decades to come. A new Infiniti QX50 sport utility vehicle to be unveiled at a media event in Los Angeles on Nov. 28 will highlight one technology Kiga plans to use.The QX50 will be the industry’s first use of a variable compression ratio system. The engine has a maximum thermal efficiency of around 40 percent, as much as twice the level of current gasoline engines in the industry, which average around 20 to 30 percent. Thermal efficiency refers to the power an engine generates from a unit of fuel.The Nissan/Infiniti VC Turbo illustrates a challenge for policy makers eager to see the end of the internal combustion engine’s dominance of transportation. While battery costs for electric vehicles are coming down, improvements in internal combustion engine efficiency could push the moment when electric vehicles achieve cost parity without government subsidies further into the future.Advancing the internal combustion engine technology is “one of the most overlooked trends in the industry,�� James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief of consultancy IHS Markit Automotive, said. “These advances beg the question. Are EVs the best solution to the issue of vehicle greenhouse emissions?”The newfangled engine, dubbed VC-Turbo for marketing purposes, uses new electronics and software to continually choose an optimal compression ratio for combustion �� until now a key factor in the trade-off between power and efficiency in a gasoline-fueled engine.The turbo-charged, 2-liter, four-cylinder VC-Turbo engine averages 30 to 35 percent better fuel economy than the much bigger 3.5-liter V6 engine it replaces, with comparable power and torque. Nissan says the new engine matches a diesel engine in torque �� the amount of thrust that helps determine the car’s acceleration. It is a level of performance and efficiency the conventional gasoline engine has so far struggled to achieve.Kiga said the VC Turbo system costs thousands of dollars less than a comparable gasoline-electric hybrid car, although a VC Turbo hybrid could be in the offing.Kiga said his eventual aim is to develop engines for Infiniti and Nissan vehicles that achieve a thermal efficiency of 50 percent.In a race to make gasoline engines more efficient, Toyota has come up with a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine �� the one that is equipped in the latest Camry car �� which the company claims has a maximum thermal efficiency of 40 percent. That’s an industry-leading level Toyota says it has achieved without relying on technologies such as variable compression but through incrementally improving existing technologies.Forecasts for the use of internal combustion engines over the next 10 to 15 years vary widely, but few industry officials or consultants are forecasting the end of the technology by 2030, as some government regulators have suggested. Boston Consulting Group, for example, forecast the share of fully electric vehicles at 14 percent by 2030.Consulting firm IHS Markit forecasts that by 2025 installation of gasoline engines will increase to about 73 percent of light vehicles. Diesel’s share is forecast to drop to about 17 percent.	1.58755358
DETROIT (Reuters) - Strong demand drove U.S. new car and truck sales 10 percent higher in September, adding momentum to the industry’s best August in more than a decade, consultants LMC Automotive and J.D. Power said on Thursday.Sales rose to 1.248 million new vehicles, or a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 16.5 million vehicles. This follows a 17.5 million annualized rate in August.“The strength in automotive sales is undeniable, as August sales performance was well above expectations and there is no evidence of a payback in September, suggesting that the auto recovery still has some legs,�� LMC forecaster Jeff Schuster said.LMC raised its full-year forecast for 2014 to 16.4 million vehicles from 16.3 million vehicles.It also forecast 2015 U.S. sales at 16.7 million vehicles, “with more upside potential than downside risk,�� Schuster said. At the start of this year, LMC had expected 2015 sales to be 16.5 million vehicles.Industry research firm Edmunds.com said on Thursday it expects U.S. September auto sales to show a rise of 11 percent to 1.261 million vehicles. September had one more selling day this year than in 2013.Ford Motor Co F.N is the only automaker expected to show a sales drop, of 4 percent, Edmunds said. Ford has cut production of the top-selling vehicle in America, the F-150 pickup truck, as it readies to launch the 2015 F-150.General Motors Co GM.N, the No. 1 U.S. automaker by sales, is expected to show a 22 percent rise in September U.S. sales, as will Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Edmunds said. The next biggest gains would be 17 percent by Nissan Motor Co 7201.T; 16 percent by Chrysler, a unit of Fiat SpA FIA.MI; and 7 percent by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, it added.Industry research firm Kelley Blue Book on Thursday forecast U.S. September sales will rise 9 percent to 1.24 million vehicles. KBB said GM’s rise in sales of 16 percent will trail gains by Chrysler and Nissan of 17 percent. KBB said Ford sales would fall 2.4 percent, Honda’s rise 12 percent and Toyota’s rise 7 percent.	-3.632532659
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has agreed to partner with China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) 300750.SZ to supply and develop batteries for new energy vehicles. The Japanese automaker said on Wednesday that the firms had also started talks covering a range of areas including new technology development and the reuse and recycling of batteries.“To further promote the widespread use of electrified vehicles, CATL and Toyota agree that a stable supply of batteries is critical and that battery technology must be further developed and advanced,�� Toyota said in a statement.Japan's largest automaker has said it aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, and last month flagged it would partner with CATL and BYD Co Ltd 002594.SZ, another Chinese firm, for battery procurement.The move illustrates the breakneck growth in the electric vehicle market, which is transforming the auto industry, and is also an acknowledgment by Toyota that it might not be able to meet demand for batteries on its own.Tapping CATL also signals a widening of Toyota's procurement pool. The Chinese firm already has relationships with other automakers such as Honda Motor 7267.T and a multi-billion dollar battery-supply deal with Volvo VOLVb.ST.	-0.4406307978
May 19 (Reuters) - Ryder System &lt;R.N), a truck rental and supply chain management company, could see its shares rise as much as 20 percent, according to a Barron’s report.In its May 18 edition, Barron’s said Ryder can capitalize on positive mometum in the truck leasing cycle.An upswing in auto and housing sales have also helped some of Ryder’s largest customers, like car makers Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors Co as well as flooring and carpet maker Mohawk Industries Inc, the report said.Shares of Ryder are up around 25 percent this year. Shares closed Friday at $62.52.“If they can get back to peak margins, the stock will be in the low 70s a year from now,�� Thomas Browne, a portfolio manager at Keeley Asset Management in Chicago, told Barron’s.	-6.117372717
SYDNEY, April 16 (Reuters) - Sales of new motor vehicles in Australia dipped 0.6 percent in March, from February, a third month of modest losses that pointed to a flattening of demand albeit at historically high levels.Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed new vehicle sales eased to a seasonally adjusted 95,113 in March, from 95,716 in February. That followed a 0.1 percent dip in February and a 2.1 percent decline in January.Sales were still up 4.5 percent on March last year.Most of the weakness in March was in sales of other vehicles, which includes trucks, which dropped 9.1 percent. Sales of passenger vehicles rose 3.3 percent, while sales of sports utilities inched down 0.5 percent after a very strong run.The ABS report contrasted with industry data out earlier this month which had shown sales up 4.7 percent in March, from February, after adjusting for seasonal factors. March this year had three fewer selling days than the same month last year.For March, Toyota retained first place on the sales ladder, followed by Mazda, Nissan and Hyundai . It is rare indeed for Japanese and South Korean car makers to take all four top spots in a month.The Holden unit of General Motors dropped back to fifth, trailed by Ford.	11.20789263
* EVs to make up only 1.5 pct of US market in 2017-analyst* Henry Ford bought his wife electric cars* Obama wants to boost consumer EV subsidies by a thirdDETROIT, March 21 (Reuters) - Scott Kluth has a love-hate relationship with his new Fisker Karma luxury electric sedan.The 34-year-old car lover bought the plug-in hybrid electric Karma in December for $107,850, but five days later the car’s battery died as he was driving in downtown Chicago. While the car he affectionately calls a “head turner�� was fixed in a recall, Kluth remains uncertain how much he will drive it.“I just want a car that works,�� Kluth said. “It’s a fun car to drive. It’s just that I’ve lost confidence in it.”The Karma’s problems -- one vehicle died during testing by Consumer Reports this month -- follow bad publicity arising from a probe of General Motors Co’s Chevrolet Volt and weak sales of the car, and the closure or bankruptcy of several electric vehicle-related start-ups.The unrelenting bad news has led to questions about the readiness of electric cars and raises fresh doubts about a technology that has been around since the late 1890s but is still struggling to win over the public.Whether electric vehicles can find an audience beyond policymakers in Washington and Hollywood celebrities depends on lowering vehicle prices without selling cars at a loss, analysts and industry executives say, while extending driving range to make the cars competitive with their gasoline-powered peers.“It’s going to be a slow slog,�� said John O’Dell, senior green car editor at industry research firm Edmunds.com. “Maybe there’s too much expectation of more and quicker success than might realistically be expected of a brand new technology.”He also questioned whether priorities will simply change for whomever is U.S. president after the November election. Electric vehicles could lose tax breaks -- currently worth $7,500 a vehicle for buyers -- particularly if a Republican ends up in the White House.Edmunds expects pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids to make up only 1.5 percent of the U.S. market in 2017, compared with 0.1 percent last year, and O’Dell said that may be optimistic. Consumers charge all-electric cars by plugging into an outlet, while hybrid versions include a gasoline engine.President Barack Obama’s administration has been a strong proponent of electric vehicles like the Volt and set a goal of getting 1 million battery-powered vehicles on the road by 2015. Lux Research estimates that number will actually be fewer than 200,000. Both the Volt and Karma’s development were supported by low-interest federal loans.That has not dissuaded automakers, many of which plan to launch electric vehicles to join the Volt and Nissan’s all-electric Leaf in a bid to meet rising fuel efficiency standards. Toyota has begun selling a plug-in Prius, and EVs from Ford, Honda, BMW and Fiat will join the fray this year, along with cars from start-ups Tesla and Coda Automotive.Electric cars aren’t a new concept. Henry Ford bought his wife, Clara, at least two electric cars in the early 1900s offering at best 50 miles driving range and top speeds of about 35 miles per hour, according to the Henry Ford Museum.But analysts said automakers have not done a good enough job getting the costs down and explaining the technology to win over anyone beyond early adopters like actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pop idol Justin Bieber, comedian Jay Leno and former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.“You can do all the advertising and promotion you want, but if people don’t buy into the message the needle’s not going to move,�� said George Cook, a marketing professor at the University of Rochester’s business school and a former Ford executive.The Volt, at almost $40,000 before federal subsidies, is seen as too expensive by many critics. Fiat-Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, a long-time EV skeptic, has said Chrysler will lose more than $10,000 on every battery-powered Fiat 500 it sells.And even with rising gasoline prices -- topping $4 a gallon in parts of the country -- EVs are just not competitive, according to the Lundberg Survey. Gasoline prices would have to rise to $8.53 a gallon to make the Leaf competitive and hit $12.50 for a Volt to be worth it, based on the cost of gasoline versus electricity, fuel efficiency and depreciation, the survey said.Obama’s vision, which he laid out at a Daimler truck plant in North Carolina this month, includes a car battery that costs half the price of today’s versions and can go up to 300 miles on a single charge. The industry is far from achieving that.Since last fall, there has been a run of bad news for EVs, starting with the late November news that U.S. safety regulators were investigating the Volt for possible battery fires.While the federal investigation was closed with the conclusion there was no defect and the car did not pose a greater risk of fire than gas-powered vehicles, weak demand led GM to halt production for five weeks and temporarily lay off 1,300 workers at the plant that builds the car. GM, which strengthened the structural protection of the Volt battery, has repeatedly said the car is safe, and some said the safety probe should have never occurred.The Karma that died during testing by Consumer Reports magazine was another blow following a recall of more than 200 of the cars last year and the halting of sales in January for a software issue. Fisker, which builds the Karma in Finland, also suspended work last month at its U.S. plant scheduled to make another car, the Nina sedan, while it works to renegotiate a $529 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy.Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher said problems can arise with new technologies and a new company but added Fisker had gone “beyond the call of duty�� in instituting a system to respond to customer issues and had plenty of satisfied owners. CEO Tom LaSorda in a letter to Karma owners last week said Fisker was committed to giving customers “complete peace of mind�� and he had created a “SWAT team�� of 50 engineers and consultants to identify issues with the car.‘FIRST LAW OF DISNEY’�The expectations have always been too high for electric cars,�� said Bill Reinert, Toyota’s U.S. manager for advanced technology. “The realities have always been clouded by the dreams. I like to say it’s the first law of thermodynamics versus the first law of Disney. Disney is wishing it will be so. It doesn’t work.�� Toyota has always been skeptical EVs would quickly boost its share of the auto market.Meanwhile, several companies have struggled due to lack of funding or customer troubles.A123 Systems posted a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss this month after Fisker, one of its largest customers, cut battery orders. Bright Automotive, an Indiana electric commercial truck start-up, closed its doors in February after failing to get a federal loan.Ener1 Inc, which received a $118.5 million federal grant to make lithium-ion batteries for EVs, filed for bankruptcy in January, and Aptera Motors, a California-based EV start-up, went out of business last December after it couldn’t raise $80 million in private funding.“There will be more companies that fail, but it’s no different than Internet companies,�� said Kristen Helsel, vice president of EV solutions for AeroVironment, which makes EV charging stations for BMW, Mitsubishi and Nissan. “People with the right business model are going to do fine.”A number of top national retail chains, including Kohl’s and Walgreen, have begun installing charging stations at their stores, but critics say the U.S. push for electric cars has come before such infrastructure is in place, weakening the case for consumers to be attracted to the technology.But since the bankruptcy of Solyndra, a solar panel maker that received $535 million in U.S. loan guarantees, federal support for advanced vehicle technology programs has ground to a halt. Industry officials and analysts point to tightened U.S. Department of Energy requirements in the face of withering criticism from Republicans about the Obama administration’s generosity for anything related to green technology.“There was certainly a different energy level one year ago, even two years ago,�� said Oliver Hazimeh, sustainable transportation practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. “This year, it just had a different drumbeat.�� Hazimeh sees long-term demand for EVs rising to up to 9 percent of the global market by 2022, but he predicts there will be some setbacks along the way.Obama wants to increase the tax subsidies for buyers of electric vehicles to $10,000 per vehicle from the current $7,500. But critics say the small EV sales totals tell the real story.Complicating matters, automakers continue to squeeze increased fuel efficiency out of the internal combustion engine. That makes it tougher to make EV sticker prices attractive enough to put a dent in the traditional gasoline-powered vehicles�� domination of the market. [ID: nN1E7AE04G]The EV’s industry’s struggles have vindicated the more deliberate approach taken by Toyota, Ford and Chrysler’s Marchionne, who killed plans for a Chrysler electric car, analysts said.Still, proponents say electric-car sales will grow just like Toyota’s hybrid Prius rose from about 5,500 in its U.S. debut in 2000 to a peak of more than 180,000 in 2007.Doug Parks, GM’s chief Volt engineer, said the proof is in the large amounts of money automakers are spending on EV technology development.“Follow the money. People are investing huge in this stuff,�� he said. “This is a 10- or 20-year discussion and we’ve been selling the Volt for a year.”GM, which recently launched a new advertising campaign centered on testimonials by adoring Volt owners, has made the car the centerpiece of efforts to seize from Toyota the mantle as the world’s greenest automaker. Meanwhile, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has estimated pure electric vehicles like the Leaf will make up 10 percent of industry global sales by 2020.Time will tell if that’s wishful thinking.“It’s been the Kool-Aid that the entire political system has been drinking for a decade,�� said Bob Martin, a senior consultant with auto product development firm The CarLab. “Electric cars are not ready for prime time. They’re really interesting toys for very, very rich people.��	-5.922065616
LONDON (Reuters) - Short-term home rental company Airbnb Inc has joined the ranks of leading sponsors of the Olympic Games with a nine year deal to help provide accommodation for the world’s biggest sporting event and cut the cost for host cities.Airbnb said on Monday the partnership with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would run from the Tokyo games next year until 2028 and cover five Olympics and Paralympics events. Financial details were not disclosed.That period will include the summer Games in Paris in 2024 and Los Angeles in 2028, as well as the winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 and one centered on Milan four years later.The move, which sees Airbnb joining other major sponsors including Coca-Cola, Panasonic, Samsung, Alibaba, Visa and Toyota, highlights the company’s rapid growth to become one of the major players in room rental.It is currently revamping policies to improve trust after a mass shooting at a property in California last month.IOC President Thomas Bach said the partnership would not replace the traditional Olympic village where athletes stay but would be based on a guarantee of accommodation for visitors, families of athletes, and officials.The IOC requires candidate cities to guarantee 40,000 rooms, and Bach said it would help host cities save and make the games more feasible and sustainable.“Now these cities can build in the potential of Airbnb, and do not need to promise to build new hotels or accommodation, they can (instead) refer to the number of hosts Airbnb is offering,�� he told Reuters.The likes of Paris and Los Angeles already have plenty of hotels and well-developed Airbnb host communities already.But the IOC hopes the agreement will help local residents to enjoy more of the benefits of hosting Olympics and reduce the resistance that has seen a number of cities pull out of the bidding process for Games in recent years.Locals staged protests at the last summer games in Rio de Janeiro because of the cost of hosting the event when Brazil was mired in recession.Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia said he hoped the partnership would help leave a “positive legacy for athletes and host communities,�� as well as give benefits for the company, such as integrated booking of accommodation with online ticket purchases.The partnership also allows athletes to make money by hosting “experiences�� through Airbnb, and the IOC will make $28 million worth of accommodation available to athletes to help them train and compete over the nine years.Founded in 2008, Airbnb has shifted from disrupting the hotel sector to increasingly being one of the leaders in the accommodation sector.Gebbia said the deal represented another step in the company moving towards being an establishment player, though he declined to comment on its plans to go public next year.The company has moved to tighten its policies, banning party houses and aiming to make all listings verified by December 2020 after a Halloween shooting at a party at a rental home.Airbnb Head of Policy Chris Lehane said the policy changes had been planned before the incident.“We look at 2019, 2020 as big investment years for us, and the announcements that we made a week or so ago are major components of that big investment,�� he told Reuters.“We have more money in the bank than we have actually raised, and our economic model allows us ... (to) continue to invest.��	-0.06300315016
BEIJING, July 1 (Reuters) - The former chairman of one of China’s top state-owned automakers, FAW Group Corp, has been expelled from the country’s largely rubber stamp parliament as he is being investigated for graft, state news agency Xinhua said on Wednesday.Xinhua said in a brief report that Xu Jianyi had been “disqualified�� as a member of the National People’s Congress.It gave no further details, but the decision removes the immunity from prosecution he had enjoyed as a member of parliament.The ruling Communist Party said in March that Xu was being investigated for “violating party discipline��, the usual euphemism for corruption.It has not been possible to contact Xu for comment.After taking over as party and military chief in late 2012, President Xi Jinping declared war on corruption at all levels in China, vowing to go after powerful “tigers�� and lowly “flies��. Scores of senior officials have been brought down by the campaign, including former security tsar Zhou Yongkang.FAW Group Corp, which counts Faw Car Co Ltd as one of its units, is one of China’s biggest automakers which has joint ventures with Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors in China.

* Despite upbeat earnings, yen’s rise poses risk to shares* Topix continues to outperform Nikkei on small-cap strength* Mazda rises on Toyota tie-up news, Suzuki soars on earningsTOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average slipped on Friday as the yen’s rise to seven-week highs overshadowed optimism on corporate earnings, while Mazda Motor rose ahead of an expected announcement of a capital alliance with Toyota Motor.The Nikkei shed 0.4 percent to 19,952.33, but stayed flat on the week. The trading range in which it has remained since mid-June has narrowed.A surprisingly soft reading on the U.S. services sector sapped risk appetite and helped to bring down the dollar to a seven-week low of 109.85 yen on Friday.“If the dollar falls below 110 yen, many companies will have to change their assumption on the exchange rates. That means risk of downward revision to the current optimism on earnings. We are at a watershed now,�� said Seiki Orimi, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Japanese companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far saw a 12.9 percent rise in operating profit, with 60 percent of them beating market expectations, according to Okasan Securities.Market players also noted, however, that many shares tended to fall, or quickly lose gains, even if their earnings were in line with expectations.Shares of Kirin Holdings fell 4.5 percent on Friday after Japan’s largest beverage company by market value raised its annual operating profit outlook by 4.1 percent, slightly less than analysts had expected.Lion fell 6.7 percent after the earnings of the manufacturer of toothpaste and other toiletry goods came in line with expectations.On the other hand, Suzuki Motor jumped 8.7 percent after the automaker’s profits for the quarter beat market expectations.Among other automakers, Mazda Motor ended 2.8 percent higher after a source told Reuters that the automaker and rival Toyota Motor Corp are expected to announce plans on Friday to build a $1.6 billion U.S assembly plant as part of a new joint venture.The Nikkei business daily reported in its online edition earlier that Motor will issue new shares to Toyota as part of an agreement that will see Toyota take a roughly 5 percent stake in its smaller rival.Toyota shares dropped 0.1 percent.The broader Topix fell 0.2 percent to 1,631.45, maintaining its outperformance versus the Nikkei since June thanks to strength in small-cap shares.The so-called NT ratio, which measures the Nikkei’s value relative to the Topix, fell to 12.23, its lowest level since February 2016.

YOKOHAMA, Japan, May 10 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co posted a 46.1 percent rise in its quarterly net profit, as the weakening yen helps Japanese carmakers repatriate overseas earnings at a more favourable rate than previously.In January-March, Japan’s second biggest automaker by sales volume posted net profit of 110 billion yen ($1.11 billion), compared with 75.3 billion yen in the same period last year.The fourth-quarter figure was above an average forecast of 100.8 billion yen net profit made by five analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Nissan expects global retail sales of 5.3 million vehicles in the current business year that ends in 2014, up from 4.9 million last year.In the financial year ended March, Nissan was the only one among Japan’s top three automakers to see annual global vehicle sales fall from the previous year.That was partially due to sales falling in China after anti-Japan protests in September, and partially because it enjoyed a strong 2012, having recovered more quickly than its rivals from the 2011 earthquake that hit Japan.Of the Japanese automakers, Nissan is the most exposed to China. The world’s biggest auto market accounts for about a quarter of its global sales.Nissan’s sales slowdown is casting doubt on whether it will be able to achieve its goal of winning 8 percent global market share by March 2017, with an operating margin of 8 percent.For the nine months to December, Nissan had a 6.2 percent global share.Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co both booked record sales in the year ended March. Toyota’s rose 16.3 percent, while Honda’s sales grew 32.2 percent year-on-year.	-0.1071899736
DETROIT (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T said on Monday its has invested $267 million and will add 300 new jobs to support increased production of its revamped 2018 Accord sedan model at the Japanese automaker's plant in Marysville, Ohio. Honda unveiled the newest-generation Accord in July, one of four re-engineered midsize sedans that Asian automakers are betting on to win market share as Detroit rivals shift focus to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T all-new Camry, offers more horsepower, safety technology like standard collision-avoiding braking and better fuel economy although Honda did not release figures.Honda’s investment in Ohio consists of $220 million for the Marysville plant, including a new $165 million welding department with 342 welding robots. The automaker is also investing $47 million at its Anna, Ohio, engine plant to provide turbocharged engines for the Accord.The Marysville plant also makes the Acura TLX, a luxury midsize sedan, and the Acura ILX, a luxury compact sedan. With the new investments the plant will have a capacity of 440,000 vehicles a year and can add volume for the Accord as necessary, Steve Rodriguez, Honda’s manufacturing leader for the Accord, told reporters on a conference call on Monday.Ray Mikiciuk, Honda assistant vice president for sales, said the company is not giving a sales forecast for the Accord, but added “I don’t expect to sell fewer Accords in 2018 with this great new product.”Honda's announcement follows Toyota's last month that it would take a 5 percent stake in smaller Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T as part of an alliance that will include a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant and collaboration on electric vehicles.The plant came as a surprise for investors at a time of weakening U.S. new vehicle sales.It also stands in contrast to recent moves by General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N. Faced with declining sedan sales, GM has cut the third shift at a couple of its plants. Ford has announced it will move production of its next generation Focus sedan to China from Mexico to save $500 million in retooling costs. The U.S. automaker also announced in May it was laying off more than 1,000 salaried workers.Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year.	2.507079793
TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp posted a 98% plunge in its first-quarter operating profit on Thursday as the coronavirus pandemic halved it global sales.Japan’s top automaker reported a profit of 13.9 billion yen ($131.73 million) for the April-June quarter, its worst since the June 2011 quarter. Still, it was better than an average estimate for a loss of 179 billion yen based on a Refinitiv poll of seven analysts.Toyota kept its forecast for an annual operating profit of 500 billion yen, which would be its weakest in nine years.While business has begun to show signs of recovery, Toyota expects the pandemic will lead to a 13% drop in its global car sales the year to March 2021.

"DETROIT/LONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Automakers are scrambling to ship vehicles to the United States to pre-empt possible higher tariffs, according to port data, port officials and logistics companies.Data from a number of U.S. ports showed a surge in vehicle exports and imports in May, as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on China and Europe to drop tariffs on U.S. vehicles and make other changes to their trade practices. May is the most recent month for which figures are available.The Trump administration’s tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports are due to go into effect at 0401 GMT on Friday, which is just after midday in Beijing.In the United States, the ports of Baltimore, Jacksonville, Florida; and Brunswick, Georgia - the three leading U.S. ports for importing automobiles - in May unloaded a combined 23,000 more cars than they did a year earlier. Auto exports out of Baltimore and Jacksonville that month were up 39 percent and 19 percent, respectively, port officials said.At the port of Long Beach, whose auto customers include Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and also Daimler AG DAIGn.DE’s Mercedes-Benz, vehicle imports were up 3.4 percent in May, but exports were down 24 percent at 1,679 units. Vehicle imports in Norfolk, Virginia, rose more than 350 percent to 3,782 vehicles, partly due to General Motors Co GM.N importing some cars from Mexico by sea to circumvent U.S. rail network problems.According to DataStream, which has weekly railcar loading data by product type, the four-week rolling sum of automobile car loadings hit a 14-month high in early-to-mid-May.The increase in vehicles landing in the United States was not preceded by a surge in sales. U.S. sales of some European and Asian autos, including BMW BMWG.DE, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, are flat to down this year. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T did not respond to requests for comment. Trump said on Friday his administration’s investigation into whether to increase tariffs on cars from the European Union and other trading partners would be completed in three to four weeks.Last week two major auto trade groups warned that imposing tariffs on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically hike prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.Even without tariffs, automakers and analysts were already expecting U.S. new vehicle sales to fall in 2018 versus last year, creating a highly competitive market.Tariffs could force automakers to either raise car prices or absorb the higher cost.A 25 percent tariff could, for instance, add $8,000 to $10,000 or more to the price an imported BMW 3 series sedan, making the luxury vehicle less attractive to buyers versus an American-made car.In late June, German automaker Daimler warned that new import tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt sales of high-margin Mercedes-Benz sports utility vehicles and eat into its pretax profit.As the United States, China and Europe exchanged tariff threats during the spring, global automakers began ""a push to speed up delivery to markets where tariffs are scheduled to increase, such as the U.S.,"" said a spokeswoman for Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics ASA WWLO.OL, which specializes in hauling vehicles by sea.In China, automakers sought to slow down vehicle imports after the government said tariffs on foreign-made vehicles would drop to 15 percent from 25 percent as of July 1.Wang Chun, deputy director of the China Automobile Dealers Association’s import committee, said the group noticed a sharp decrease in car imports and imported vehicle sales in May.“It’s possible that they were delaying shipping so that they could take advantage of the new tariff effective from July 1st,�� Chun said last week.Chinese port data is not yet available for May, but imports rose 5.7 percent to more than 4.3 million vehicles in April.China, which cut tariffs on all imported automobiles this week, plans to slap an additional 25 percent levy on 545 American products, including U.S.-made cars, starting on Friday, should the Trump administration’s tariffs go into effect.Ford Motor Co F.N said on Thursday that for now it will not hike prices of imported Ford and higher-margin luxury Lincoln models in China, thus absorbing the cost of the new tariffs."	-0.8567459092
* Nikkei falls more than 3 pct for 6th time this quarter* Real estate companies worst hit, exporters battered* Yen stronger than most exporters�� assumed FX rate* Mothers market plunges 7 pct as investors lock in gainsBy Hideyuki SanoTOKYO, June 16 (Reuters) - Japanese share prices tumbled to four-month lows on Thursday, as the Bank of Japan’s inaction, a cautious Fed that fuels the yen’s strength and worries over Britain’s possible departure from Europe all made for reasons to sell.The Nikkei average fell 3.1 percent to 15,434.14, its lowest level since mid-April. It is the sixth time it fell more than 3 percent this quarter. Until mid-2015, a fall of over 3 percent was rare.The broader Topix fell 2.8 percent to 1,241.56, its lowest level since mid-February.“Fears are gripping fund managers. They are now reducing stocks and increasing cash to protect their funds,�� said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.“And when fears dominate, you could see some amazing pricings,�� he added.The Nikkei volatility index rose to 35.6 percent, its highest level since February.The BOJ refrained from introducing more stimulus. Although such an outcome was widely expected, there had been some speculation about easing due to the fragile state of the Japanese economy and BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s history of surprising markets with policy decisions.Real estate companies were the worst hit, dumped by a minority of market players who had bought them earlier on hopes of s BOJ easing.Real estate company subindex fell 4.2 percent, with Mitsui Fudosan dropping 4.6 percent.Exporters were badly hit too, as the yen shot up to as high as 104 yen per dollar, its highest level in almost two years.That level is stronger than the exchange rate assumed by even the most cautious exporters, such as Toyota Motor and Fanuc, which expect the dollar at 105 yen for the current business year.Most other companies have assumed a dollar/yen exchange rate of 110-115 yen in the current financial year for their earnings estimate, suggesting many profit outlooks will have to be lowered.Panasonic fell 3.9 percent while Hitachi shed 3.6 percent. Toyota dropped 3.3 percent and Fanuc fell 1.8 percent.So far this week, the Nikkei has lost 7 percent and the market looks oversold in the short-term.Yet, overriding worries about Brexit are so large that few investors expect a major rebound at least until the UK referendum a week from now.“It is hard to buy risk assets unless we get past next Thursday,�� said Keita Kubota, investment manager at Aberdeen Investment Management.As investors rushed to sell shares that still have some gains, the index for the Mothers start-up market plunged 7.1 percent. The index has fallen 17.7 percent this week though it is up 8.2 percent year-to-date, compared to a fall of almost 19 percent in the Nikkei.Shares of Bio-pharmaceutical developer Sosei Group, a star performer since late last year, fell 10.2 percent.

TOKYO, March 22 (Reuters) - Tokyo 2020 organisers have started drafting possible alternatives to holding the Olympics this summer, two sources familiar with the talks said, in contrast to the Japanese government’s stance that postponement is not an option.While the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted sports events around the world, Japan has been steadfast in saying that the Games will go on. The top government spokesman on Wednesday said Tokyo wasn’t preparing for postponement.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has staked his legacy as Japan’s longest-serving premier on the Games and is hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending. At risk is more than $3 billion in domestic sponsorship, an Olympic record, and some $12 billion spent on preparations.“Finally, we have been asked to make a simulation in case of a postponement,�� said one of the sources, an official close to the organising committee who is involved in drafting the scenarios.Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.“We are making alternative plans - plan B, C, D - looking at different postponement time-frames,�� said the official, adding the scenarios included cost estimates for different delays.Neither Tokyo 2020 organisers nor the International Olympic Committee (IOC) immediately responded to a request for comment. The government of Japan could not be reached for comment.The options, which include scaling back the Games or holding them without spectators, would be debated by the organising committee at the end of March, the official said.The second source, who is also close to the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, confirmed that postponement was being discussed, including delays of one or two years.Some organising staff were holding out hope for a delay of a month or 45 days, said the official involved in drafting the scenarios.A final decision on postponement will have to come from the IOC but Japan’s stance also matters.The IOC and its powerful chief, Thomas Bach, say the Games will go ahead as planned, drawing fire from athletes who say that could be a health risk.Two other insiders, both senior members of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, echoed those concerns. One of them, a board member of the organising committee, said the decision to postpone should be made quickly.“The more they push the decision away ... more and more preparations have to be made - this will cause cancellation fees to go through the roof,�� the board member said.Bach recently appeared to shift his tone, saying the IOC was “considering different scenarios��.The official involved in drafting scenarios said a long delay could spark complaints from older athletes and require keeping sponsors on board for longer. Another headache is the Olympic village, due to be converted to flats after the Games.The summer 2021 calendar is already crowded while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.Japanese sponsors are nervous, company representatives have said privately. Major sponsors include Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp.“Of course companies are individually discussing what to do,�� said a representative of one of the more than 60 sponsors. “No one wants to be the first to say anything about the possibility of a postponement.”Japan Airlines Co discussed that there was an 80% chance the Olympics would not be held as scheduled on a recent internal conference call, a person briefed on the call said.A JAL spokesman said: “Our preparations are underway for the Games to open as scheduled��.In Tokyo, there is a sense delay may be inevitable. Finance Minister Taro Aso has compared Tokyo 2020 to the 1940 Olympics cancelled by World War II, and the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games.“It’s a problem that’s happened every 40 years,�� he said. “It’s the cursed Olympics - and that’s a fact.��	8.613861386
(Adds details about the investigation)NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors are trying to determine whether Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp misled U.S. regulators about the number of defective air bags it sold to automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.Word of the investigation follows a notice on Tuesday from the U.S. auto regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which increased the number of cars potentially affected by defective air bags made by Takata to at least 7.8 million, up from the roughly 4.74 million they announced a day earlier.The NHTSA has its own investigation underway. It is trying to determine whether Takata air bag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force potentially could spray metal shrapnel at occupants. They have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.The probe has focused on inflators recovered from cars being recalled for repairs in hot and humid regions such as Florida. Takata is cooperating with that investigation along with 10 automakers.The NHTSA has urged owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda Motor Corp, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co Ltd , Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Subaru Co Ltd , Chrysler , Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co vehicles to replace air bags as soon as possible.More than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled since 2008 because of defective Takata air bags.Reuters previously reported that manufacturing problems with Takata’s air bags go beyond what the Tokyo-based company disclosed to the NHTSA about why the devices were at risk of exploding with dangerous force, citing internal company documents.According to Wednesday’s report, the investigation by federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is in its very early stages. The company has not been accused of any wrongdoing. A spokeswoman from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment.Spokespeople for Takata, Honda and Ford could not immediately be reached for comment.A BMW spokesman declined to comment on the possibility, adding that the German automaker is focused on carrying out the recall as fast as possible.Spokespeople for Toyota and Chrysler said they had no information on a possible federal investigation of Takata.Spokesmen for Mazda and Mitsubishi said their companies had not been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice and could not confirm the report.A Nissan spokesman said the automaker had no knowledge of such an investigation and declined further comment.Spokespeople from Subaru and GM declined to comment.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday some of Canada’s mining firms were behind on their tax payments and urged the Canadian government to lean on them to avoid the dispute reaching international tribunals.“There are a few Canadian mining companies that are not up-to-date, they want to go to international tribunals,�� Lopez Obrador told a regular government news conference.The president then urged Canada’s ambassador to prevail on the companies that there was no need to seek legal redress because “it’s very clear that they have these debts with the tax authority, and that (Canada) help us to convince them.”He did not name any specific companies.A spokeswoman for Canada’s embassy in Mexico said the embassy does not comment on or confirm private interactions between governments.Last month Canada’s First Majestic Silver Corp said it had served notice to Mexico’s government under its North American trade treaty obligations to begin talks to resolve taxation disputes.First Majestic did not return a call seeking comment.Nearly 70% of foreign-owned mining companies operating in Mexico are based in Canada, according to Global Affairs Canada. The value of Canadian mining assets in Mexico totaled C$18.4 billion in 2017, according to the Mining Association of Canada.Lopez Obrador has made cracking down on tax breaks a priority. A number of major companies, including the Mexican unit of U.S. retailer Walmart Inc and Mexican conglomerate Femsa have recently agreed to make tax payments to Mexico.Lopez Obrador also said Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp is in the process of doing the same thing. Representatives for Toyota in Mexico had no immediate comment.The president’s comments come as Mexico and the private sector have also been having a major dispute on energy policy.Lopez Obrador has allowed officials to call into question contracts worth billions of dollars signed by companies from Canada, the United States and Europe under the previous administration, setting up a potentially messy legal scrap.	-4.610335089

LONDON (Reuters) - Toyota were favorites to win Le Mans even before Kamui Kobayashi smashed the lap record in qualifying, but they can take nothing for granted when the 24 Hours sportscar race starts on Saturday.The Circuit de la Sarthe, hosting the 85th edition of the French classic, has a history of heartbreak and five times runners-up Toyota know all about that.Only one Japanese manufacturer has ever won Le Mans - Mazda in 1991 with a rotary-engined car - but Toyota had looked like ending that last year until some last lap drama handed the race to Porsche.Kazuki Nakajima had been heading for the checkered flag when he reported a problem with five minutes remaining. The Japanese slowed, coming to a halt as Porsche celebrated their 18th victory.Nakajima, who put Toyota on pole in 2014 only to retire while leading in a race won by Audi, is back on the front row with a score to settle after qualifying the number eight Toyota alongside pole-sitter Kobayashi in the number seven car.Kobayashi’s fastest lap on Thursday was more than two seconds quicker than the previous record and at an average speed of 251.9 kph (156 mph).Toyota had already put down a marker in pre-race testing earlier in June, when their cars filled the top three places, and they are leading the FIA world endurance championship after two wins in two rounds.“After the test it is difficult to say that we are not favorites,�� Toyota technical director Pascal Vasselon said recently. “That is what we have been working for.”Having already destroyed the lap record, and with fine weather predicted all weekend, Toyota could also break Audi’s 2010 record for the longest distance covered in 24 hours if all goes to plan.“The record will probably be broken because back then our car was running five to six seconds slower than today’s cars,�� French driver and 2010 winner Romain Dumas told the www.lemans.org website.With Audi pulling out after last year’s race, Porsche are Toyota’s only rivals for overall victory and they have their two cars on the second row in third and fourth places as they chase a third straight win.Porsche also have five previous winners in their two crews with New Zealander Brendon Hartley the odd man out - although he did win the world endurance championship in 2015.Toyota’s third car qualified fifth with the only other entry in the top LMP1 category, the privately-run ByKolles team’s sole entry, lining up sixth.Others in the 60-car field include Brazilian former F1 driver Rubens Barrichello, making his debut in a Dallara LMP2 car at the age of 45, and Indy Car compatriot Tony Kanaan, filling in for the injured Sebastien Bourdais in a Ford GT.	5.377268386
* GM to stop car manufacturing in Indonesia* GM Indonesia to shutter assembly plant, axe 500 jobs* Part of broader emerging market restructuring* GM Indonesia chief Michael Dunne to leave by end-Feb* GM to reposition Chevrolet as SUV brand in SE AsiaBy Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING, Feb 26 (Reuters) - General Motors is to stop making cars in Indonesia, a battleground for global automakers in emerging Southeast Asia, closing an assembly plant, axing some 500 jobs and shifting its branding focus to sport utility vehicles (SUVs).The U.S. auto giant, which was the first to set up a car assembly plant in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy eight decades ago, is effectively calling time on its attempt to wrestle market share from dominant Japanese rivals, led by Toyota Motor .GM Executive Vice President Stefan Jacoby, who oversees markets beyond the Americas, Europe and China, acknowledges GM got it wrong in going head-to-head with the Japanese in a market he dubs their “backyard��.GM tried to take on Japanese rivals by locally producing its Chevrolet Spin, a strategic, small ‘people mover�� van which has proved a winner in Brazil, but it was too costly to make to be profitable in Indonesia as most of the parts had to be imported.The Spin, which sold from around $12,000 and competed with Toyota’s Avanza, failed to take off as GM had hoped, making the production plant at Bekasi, just outside Jakarta, a financial burden. Production last year was less than a quarter of Bekasi’s annual capacity of 40,000 vehicles. GM sold just 8,412 Spin cars in Indonesia last year, and exported nearly 3,000.“We could not ramp up Spin production to boost the volume as we had expected ... although the product was really good,�� Jacoby told Reuters. “The logistics chain of the Spin was too complex; we had low volume so we could not localize the car accordingly, and from the cost point of view we were just not competitive.”GM will stop making the Spin in Indonesia by end-June and shutter the Bekasi factory, which employs around 500 people. The restructuring will leave GM Indonesia as only a sales unit.The overhaul aims to turn GM Indonesia “not only into profitability, but into a sustainable business model,�� said Jacoby.The move - part of a broader repositioning of the Chevrolet brand across Southeast Asia, emphasizing its American heritage for SUVs like the Captiva and Trailblazer - comes even as GM drives into Indonesia with its Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp .The partners plan to set up a manufacturing facility near Jakarta for their no-frills Wuling brand - but aren’t interested in taking over the Bekasi plant, said a person close to the joint venture.GM’s decision to dial back its solo presence in a market of 240 million people, where fewer than four in every 100 own a car, comes as global automakers retool their strategies for the world’s big emerging markets, including Russia and India.Despite its long presence in Indonesia, GM sold fewer than 11,000 vehicles there last year, giving it a market share of below 1 percent, according to LMC Automotive. By contrast, Toyota and its Daihatsu affiliate shifted more than 578,000 vehicles. Toyota and other Japanese makers together control more than 90 percent of the market.GM Indonesia chief Michael Dunne is expected to leave his post within days, and will be replaced on an interim basis by Pranav Bhatt, chief financial officer for GM Indonesia. Dunne and Bhatt were not immediately available to comment.The stop-start Bekasi plant was opened in 1995, but shut a decade later as Japanese brands tightened their grip on the market. It was re-opened two years ago as part of the Spin revival bid. (Editing by Ian Geoghegan)	5.30398168
TOYOTA, Japan, March 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will start selling in 2015 the first vehicles built under its parts-sharing and platform framework, the company said on Wednesday, as rivals led by Volkswagen pursue similar strategies to cut costs.The framework, called the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), shares parts among vehicles using the same platform in order to save costs and manpower.Initially, vehicles will share 20-30 percent of parts, a ratio Toyota wants to eventually expand to 70-80 percent, Executive Vice President Mitsuhisa Kato said.“Global competition among automakers is becoming more severe, and TNGA is an effort to make more efficient and more attractive products,�� he told reporters.Volkswagen recently began implementing its MQB platform, and almost all of the group’s small and medium front-wheel-drive family models, including the VW Golf, are being designed around it.

* Toyota looks to lower dependence on mature markets* Aims to sell half of its vehicles in emerging mkts by 2015TOKYO, May 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it would roll out eight compact car models tailored for emerging markets by 2015 in an attempt to catch up to front-runners such as Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co.Toyota, which lost the crown as the world’s top automaker last year, is looking to reduce its dependence on the mature North American, European and Japanese markets. It wants to shift more of its weight to growth markets such as China, India and Brazil, where Volkswagen, GM and Hyundai Motor Co have taken the lead.The Japanese automaker aims to sell half of its vehicles in emerging markets by 2015, up from around 45 percent last year and 18.6 percent in 2000.“In emerging markets, there are four or five automakers vying to take the lead in sales volumes,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Yukitoshi Funo told reporters.“Particularly in the Southeast Asian region, Volkswagen and others are looking to challenge our lead so we can’t be resting on our laurels,�� he said.Including the Etios model that it launched in India in December 2010, Toyota plans to introduce eight compact cars by 2015, targeting combined annual sales of more than 1 million vehicles in over 100 countries during that period.The upcoming cars will be priced around 1 million yen ($12,600) or higher and produced in local markets such as India, Brazil and China. Toyota said it would aim to procure 100 percent of the cars�� components locally to lower costs - a move that would require a stronger R&amp;D function in those markets.By 2013, production capacity in emerging markets will rise to 3.1 million vehicles a year, from 2.38 million in 2010, matching the level in Japan, Toyota said.Funo dismissed a report published in Japan’s Asahi newspaper on Thursday that Toyota was working on a car priced around 500,000 yen ($6,300) for the Indian market, to be sold under a new brand from around 2016.“We won’t go to the 500,000 yen segment - it’s not our category,�� Funo said. “We want to beef up our presence in segments where we can be competitive. There are many other options for customers looking in that price range, including used cars.”Funo added that the cheaper segments were the territory of subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co, which has expertise in smaller, lower-cost vehicles.Carmakers such as Nissan Motor Co and Hyundai are considering ultra-low-cost cars, potentially tapping a huge base of consumers trading up from motorcycles.Toyota’s cheapest car is the Etios, which sells for about $9,000 in India, or double the price of market leader Maruti Suzuki India’s Alto.	-0.9244791667
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T plans to make a record 8.79 million vehicles under the Toyota and Lexus brands in 2013 and 9.5 million in 2014, a member of the Toyota labor union federation said on Wednesday.The Japanese automaker also plans to produce 3.02 million vehicles in Japan in 2013 and 3.0 million vehicles in 2014, sticking to its pledge to continue making at least 3 million cars at home, said a member of the Federation of All Toyota Workers�� Union who spoke on condition of anonymity.Toyota presented the figures to labor unions during pay negotiations, he said.Toyota could not be immediately reached for comment.The ramp up in production comes in the midst of a shift in Toyota’s capital expenditure plan.The automaker, which expanded too fast to meet booming demand and then tripped when the financial crisis and the yen’s rise hit, has said it will not build new factories over the next three years except for ones it has already announced investments in, despite a weaker yen boosting its profits.Instead, it will increase production by fully utilizing and operating existing plants, Senior Managing Officer Takahiko Ijichi told reporters.Last year, Toyota regained the title as the world's best-selling automaker, beating General Motors GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.It made a record 8.74 million vehicles globally under the Toyota and Lexus brands. For the entire Toyota group, which includes Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T and Hino Motors 7205.T, production was 9.91 million vehicles.	2.1859545
* Nikkei regains key 9,500 level* Toyota, exporters helped by weaker yen* Financials gain as Spain worries ease somewhatTOKYO, April 18 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share index climbed 1.7 percent to regain the key 9,500 level on Wednesday after robust U.S. corporate earnings, a well-received Spanish debt sale and an upbeat German economic sentiment survey.Comments by Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura that the central bank is ready to take additional steps to ease monetary policy as necessary also brightened investors�� mood after this week’s sell-off on concerns over Spain’s ability to finance its debt.The Nikkei was up 157.68 points at 9,622.39 by the midday break, after falling below the psychologically important 9,500 mark on Monday.“You have a bounce in the U.S. markets. You have some sense of policymakers in Europe who are keen to stabilise concerns there. Data wasn’t horrible in the U.S. ... Earnings were good to mixed,�� said Stefan Worrall, director of equity cash sales at Credit Suisse in Tokyo.“You have a huge sell-off, so it’s not surprising that it has a bounce,�� he added.Improved global risk appetite took the wind out of the yen, further boosting the appeal of Japanese exporters, which are strongly represented in the Nikkei benchmark.Toyota Motor Corp and industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp both climbed 2.6 percent, while TDK Corp surged 3.6 percent.The broader Topix index advanced 1.8 percent to 817.74. Trading volume on the main board was light, at 39 percent of its full daily average for the past 90 days.“There are a lot of companies reporting this week in the U.S. ... I think just ahead of numbers, people are a little bit reluctant to put stuff to work,�� a senior dealer at a foreign bank said.Financials were also in demand as concerns over Spain’s ability to finance its debt eased somewhat after the country raised more funding than planned at its bill auction on Tuesday.Sentiment also improved after German analyst and investor confidence rose unexpectedly in April to a high not seen since June 2010, while the U.S. company earnings season has had a surprisingly strong start.Nomura Holdings, Japan’s top investment bank, rose 3.5 percent. Megabanks Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group gained between 2.9 and 3.2 percent.On Tuesday, Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs, Johnson &amp; Johnson, International Business Machines Corp and Intel reported profits that beat analysts�� estimates.The Nikkei has fallen 4.6 percent so far this month after rallying more than 19 percent in January-March, its best first-quarter performance in 24 years.Global investors�� appetite towards Japanese equities has waned in April.A monthly survey of asset managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed investor allocation in Japanese stocks fell to 10 percent net underweight this month from 4 percent in March, but still above February’s net 23 percent underweight.	-6.732066217
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T have agreed to set up a joint venture that will begin developing electric vehicle (EV) batteries from April, as the Japanese companies gear up for an expected surge in demand.The new company, called Prime Planet Energy and Solutions, will develop prismatic - or square-shaped - batteries that will be available to any automaker, the two companies said in a statement on Monday.It will begin operations on April 1 with more than 5,000 employees, with Toyota owning 51% and Panasonic holding the remainder, the pair said.The venture reflects the aim of the Japanese companies to become bigger global players in the automotive battery industry, which is vital for the development of affordable EVs, as stricter environmental regulations worldwide accelerate a shift toward environmentally friendlier cars.“Batteries - as solutions for providing energy for automobiles and various other forms of mobility, and as solutions for various kinds of environmental issues - are expected to fulfill a central role in society going forward,�� the companies said in the statement.Panasonic has been the exclusive supplier of cylindrical batteries for U.S. EV maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O, but has been looking to expand its list of customers by stepping up development of the prismatic batteries more widely used in the industry. Tesla last month announced it would also source batteries from South Korea's LG Chem Ltd 051910.KS and China's CATL 300750.SZ.Toyota, which pioneered the petrol-electric hybrid Prius in 1997, aims to get half of its sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, and is both developing its own batteries and tapping new suppliers to avoid a shortfall.The two Japanese companies have been cooperating on battery research since at least 1996 when they set up a joint venture to make hybrid car batteries, called Primearth EV Energy.	-5.089260006

TOKYO (Reuters) - Buses may not be the most glamorous mode of transport but at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games, they will represent Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T best bet for wider acceptance of hydrogen power - technology so far eclipsed by electric vehicles.Japan’s biggest automaker plans to roll out 100 hydrogen fuel cell buses to shuttle visitors between venues, a stepping stone to a big ramp up for the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.There, more than 1,000 buses are planned in partnership with Beiqi Foton Motor Co 600166.SS, according to people familiar with the project, which aims to make the most of a push by China to start adopting the zero-emissions technology.The plans to promote hydrogen with its exclusive Olympic ‘mobility�� sponsorship deal - one Toyota holds until 2024 - underscore its determination to keep backing the technology. That’s despite an increasing number of electric cars on the road and Toyota’s own efforts to speed up EV development.But its reliance on buses for hydrogen publicity also highlights the lack of traction for its fuel cell cars, and the risk that hydrogen-powered transport may never be more than a niche market despite a quarter century of development and Japanese government backing.Toyota has sold fewer than 10,000 of the Mirai, a fuel cell sedan it touted as a game changer at its launch five years ago. Costing consumers about 5 million yen ($46,200) in Japan after subsidies, it is one of three fuel cell cars available to consumers. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS sells the Nexo, while Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T leases out the Clarity.By contrast, Tesla Inc TSLA.O sold 25,000 of its all-electric Model S sedans in its first year and a half. The disappointing Mirai sales reflect insufficient refueling stations, consumer worries about resale values and concerns over the risk of hydrogen explosions. A hydrogen tank blast in South Korea that killed two in May was followed by another at a Norway hydrogen station in June.“Hydrogen still has this image of being dangerous - that it might explode - and our aim with the Olympics is to erase this image,�� Masaaki Ito, Toyota’s general manager of its Olympic and Paralympic division, told Reuters.The company will also provide 500 Mirai sedans to ferry officials between venues at the Tokyo Olympics. “We want to expose the technology to as many people as possible.”Toyota, which is also developing fuel cell delivery trucks and big rigs, has not disclosed how much money it has poured into the technology but it has been emboldened by support from the Japanese government, which sees hydrogen as a key way to reduce its reliance on oil.Both envision a “hydrogen society�� where homes, trains, ships, and even lunar rovers can be powered by fuel cells that turn the invisible, odorless gas into electricity.The city of Tokyo, which will showcase the Olympic village for athletes as a hydrogen society in miniature, is buying most of the buses for its Toei municipal transport service, with 15 already in operation.Unlike cars, buses have fixed routes, making it easier to plan fueling stations and give them a shot at being profitable.Local and national government subsidies cover 80% of the cost, bringing them in line with the 23 million yen ($213,000) price tag for a regular diesel bus, a Toei representative said.But lofty government goals remain unmet. Three years ago, Japan declared that by 2020 it wanted 40,000 fuel cell vehicles on the road and 160 hydrogen fueling stations in operation.Today, just 3,400 fuel cell vehicles have been sold in Japan and it has 109 hydrogen stations.Though vital for fuel cell cars to catch on, the stations are not easy to build, costing five times as much as a gasoline stand. Due to stringent safety regulations, they also require large plots of land which are in scarce supply.Yet for all the slow progress, some analysts don’t fault Toyota’s pursuit of hydrogen power, pointing to China’s backing of the technology and its vast auto market.“China is actually moving ahead a lot faster and although they suffer the same issue with lack of refueling infrastructure, China has shown in the past that they can get infrastructure done pretty quickly,�� said Janet Lewis, head of Asian auto research at Macquarie.For the Beijing games, Toyota will supply powertrain components for the Foton buses. They will be emblazoned with “Powered by Toyota�� branding during the event, the sources said, declining to be identified as the plans have not been made public.Toyota said the number of fuel cell buses for the Beijing Olympics has not been decided and that branding would be up to Foton. Foton did not respond to requests for comment.Toyota has similar deals with Higer Bus Co and China FAW Group Corp.The project with Higer will likely have a fleet of 20 buses ready for deployment in early 2020 whereas FAW plans to have its first prototype ready by the end of the year, said Audrey Ma, a director at Shanghai ReFire Technology Co, which is doing the system integration.Outside of China, the only other similar deal Toyota has announced is one to supply fuel cell systems to Portugal’s Caetanobus.Although the technology remains unprofitable, Toyota says costs will fall with scale. It is building new fuel cell stack and hydrogen tank factories so it can lift production of fuel cell vehicles to 30,000 a year.	-0.9339657059

TOKYO, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The head of Japan’s auto lobby urged the government and the Bank of Japan on Friday to quickly implement effective steps to counter the strong yen, after it hit a seven-month high against the dollar the previous day.“The current foreign exchange level, which is far from the actual ability of the Japanese economy, goes much beyond the limits of what companies can do through efforts to cut costs,�� Akio Toyoda, the head of Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA), said in a statement.“Japan’s manufacturing is facing a great crisis again, and if things remain this way it could have a further impact on employment,�� said Toyoda, who is president of Toyota Motor Corp .The dollar traded around 77.63 yen on Friday, having fallen as low as 77.13 yen on trading platform EBS the previous day, its lowest since early February, after the Federal Reserve announced bold stimulus measures.	-8.379418129
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T nudged up its annual operating profit forecast by 4.2% on favorable currency rates and better-than-expected sales, but added the impact of the new coronavirus was hard to gauge and had not yet been factored in.Automakers have suspended output at many factories in China in line with government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus which has led to some 560 deaths in the country.The epidemic is likely to wreak havoc on China auto sales and production in the first quarter, and has disrupted the supply of parts for some car makers with Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS this week saying it would have to suspend production in South Korea.“We are looking very closely at inventories of components which are made in China and used in other countries, including Japan, and at the possibility of alternative production,�� Operating Officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told a news conference.S&amp;P credit analyst Vittoria Ferraris has estimated “up to one-half�� of vehicles and components that would normally be produced in China could be affected if shutdowns are extended further. Production at many plants across China, including Toyota’s, has currently been halted through to Feb. 9.Toyota has said it plans to resume production on Feb. 10 although this could change if the situation worsens.Japan’s biggest automaker said it now expects operating profit for the year to end-March to climb to 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion), up from 2.47 trillion yen a year earlier and in line with market estimates.For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit and vehicle sales, click on tmsnrt.rs/312ftUgThe outlook is based on a new assumption for the Japanese currency to average around 108 yen to the U.S. dollar during the current business year versus 107 yen previously. It also expects to sell 10.73 million vehicles, slightly higher than a previous forecast for 10.7 million.Third-quarter profit, however, declined 3.2% to 654.4 billion yen as the yen trended higher than expected during the period and due to softer vehicle sales, though the result was slightly higher than market expectations.Sales in Asia tumbled 12.5% with demand slow in Indonesia and Thailand, while sales in North America, Toyota’s biggest market, slipped 1.8%.Toyota also said it was seeking more discussion with the British government, which announced plans this week to ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars in the country from 2035. That is five years ahead of many other countries with similar targets in what has been seen as a victory for battery-electric cars.“We don’t believe it’s possible to suddenly say ‘OK, let’s move to something like this and ban everything in one shot��. We should have steps to do this kind of thing,�� Executive Vice President Didier Leroy said.“It’s going to create big trouble for all carmakers in the world and even for customers in the UK.”Toyota operates a plant in Derbyshire, central England and produced roughly 8% of the 1.52 million cars made in Britain in 2018. It also produces engines at a factory in Wales.	-14.64025026

(Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co will offer autonomous ride sharing services in California from next month to study consumer behavior in an autonomous driving environment, the companies involved said on Friday.The South Korean carmaker will team up with Pony.ai, a self-driving start-up, and mobility service provider Via to build a fleet of at least 10 Kona electric sport-utility vehicles to provide autonomous ride-sharing services called BotRide in Irvine, California.Sequoia Capital China-backed Pony.ai, which has a partnership with Toyota, will build self-driving systems with Hyundai, while Via will develop mobile phone applications for the service, the companies said.While the vehicles will have self-driving functions, two safety operators will be onboard to take over if there is an emergency.The service will start on Nov. 4.Hyundai has announced plans to invest $35 billion in mobility and other auto technologies by 2025.	3.035998265
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp raised its full-year profit forecast by 16 percent on Friday, citing expectations of a weaker yen, after posting a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit.The world’s No. 2 automaker said it now expects full-year operating profit of 1.85 trillion yen ($16.80 billion), up from a previous forecast of 1.6 trillion yen but down from 1.99 trillion yen last year.Toyota posted an operating profit of 574.29 billion yen for April-June, down 11 percent from 642.23 billion yen a year ago. Analysts on average expected 538.3 billion yen, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results come as it is expected to announce plans to join forces with smaller rival Mazda Motor Corp to build a $1.6 billion U.S assembly plant and develop electric vehicle technologies, according to a person briefed on the matter.Toyota said it is assuming an average U.S. dollar rate of 110 yen and euro rate of 124 yen for the year, compared to earlier estimates of 105 yen and 115 yen, respectively.A weaker yen makes its cars more competitive overseas and boosts the value of repatriated earnings.“Due to a weaker yen we’ve changed our currency assumption rate, and we’ve implemented additional marketing measures and cost reductions,�� senior managing officer Tetsuya Otake told reporters at a briefing, explaining the change in profit forecast.For the quarter, Toyota weathered a slowdown in demand in the U.S. auto market, the world’s second largest after China, which is delivering a knock to many global automakers after years of growth boosted profits.By region, Toyota posted a 1 percent rise in North American vehicle sales to 723,000 due to strong demand for its recently launched C-HR compact SUV model, while sales in Asia, including in China, fell 5.4 percent to 363,000.But it downgraded its full-year sales forecast for North America to 2.78 million vehicles from a previous forecast of 2.82 million.	-0.01759943682
PARIS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Tsusho Corp, the Japanese conglomerate, said on Monday it had secured almost 98 percent of French distribution company CFAO.The Japanese company said it would decide within three months whether to keep CFAO’s French stock market listing.TTC had bought a 29.8 percent stake in CFAO in July from luxury and retail group PPR. TTC later launched a tender offer for CFAO, including PPR’s remaining 12.2 percent stake, at 37.50 euros a share. The deal valued CFAO at 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion).At the close of the tender offer on Dec. 17, TTC had received 97.91 percent of CFAO, it said in a statement.“Although having acquired more than 95 percent of CFAO’s voting rights shares, we will study whether to maintain CFAO’s French listing,�� it said.Its chief executive Jun Karube told French daily Les Echos in October that TTC wanted to keep CFAO’s listing on the Paris stock exchange.CFAO distributes vehicles and medicines in Africa and French overseas territories.	5.95396193
TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan’s new board member, Yukitoshi Funo, said on Wednesday policy makers need to take a flexible approach and respond to changes in the economy in trying to reach the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target.Achieving the 2 percent inflation target is important, but it is also important that the economy is performing well, Funo told a news conference upon joining the nine-member board on Wednesday.Funo also said Japan is making progress in escaping deflation but has not sufficiently emerged from deflation.Parliament approved the government’s nomination of Funo, a former Toyota Motor Corp executive, in May. He replaced Yoshihisa Morimoto, a former utility executive who voted against last year’s surprise monetary easing.Funo’s first policy-setting meeting will be on July 14-15, when the board conducts a quarterly review of its long-term economic and price forecasts.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese blue-chip firms on Wednesday announced wage hikes far below last year’s increases, a blow to “Abenomics�� stimulus policy at a time fears of a deepening global slowdown and jittery markets are denting business sentiment.Bellwether Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and some other leading manufacturers agreed to raise base pay for a third year in a row, under public pressure from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.But analysts found the increments disappointing.“This won’t boost the economy,�� said Hisashi Yamada, chief economist at Japan Research Institute.Given big firms�� results, the extent of wage hikes will be limited at small firms that employ seven out of 10 workers, he added, underlining the challenge to Abenomics�� trickle-down.Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara sought to put a positive spin on Wednesday’s numbers.“The trend for wage hikes from the past two years is continuing on the whole,�� he said.“This is still the third round (year of wage hikes). We must see fourth and fifth rounds to eradicate deflationary mindset.”Unions had tempered their demands, reflecting the tougher environment. Still, companies�� response at the key annual “shunto�� wage negotiations was well short of the demands.Toyota agreed to a monthly base wage rise of 1,500 yen ($13.23), half of the union’s demand and below the 4,000 yen gain given last year. Other automakers also offered smaller hikes.A Toyota official quoted Akio Toyoda, company president, as saying about the smaller increases that “the tide has changed over the business environment��. Major electric machinery makers such as Hitachi 6501.T, Mitsubishi Electric 6503.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T halved this year's base pay rise to 1,500 yen.With the economy close to another recession due to weak consumer spending, Abe has been counting on wage hikes to drive a virtuous growth cycle led by higher incomes and increased consumer spending and business investment.The monetary “arrow�� of Abenomics was meant to raise inflation expectations to 2 percent and provide a mechanism to coordinate wage and price inflation, two International Monetary Fund officials wrote on Sunday.“This has proven to be a hard struggle because companies and workers alike seem to look backward rather than forward in setting their expectations,�� said an article co-authored by IMF Japan mission chief Luc Everaert.The article came against the backdrop of growing frustration in government against Japan Inc’s resistance to significantly boost wages.“It’s about time for overseas people to pile pressure on those Japanese companies that won’t raise wages rightly,�� one senior official told Reuters.In 2014, leading companies consented to an average wage hike of 2.19 percent and last year brought a 2.38 percent raise - a 17-year high. Analysts expect pay rises to slow to just above 2 percent this year.($1 = 113.3700 yen)	-3.589362098
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it was investing $391 million in its pickup truck assembly plant in San Antonio, Texas, as part of the Japanese automaker’s plan to invest $13 billion in its U.S. operations over five years through 2021.The company said the investment will be used to introduce advance manufacturing technologies at the plant and also to help with the development and education of the local workforce.Christopher Reynolds, Toyota Motor North America’s chief administrative officer, told Reuters the investment could allow the company to eventually boost the plant’s capacity but no decision has been made.Reynolds added that the company was “bullish�� on the future of its U.S. truck sales, which are up 4% this year.Toyota’s San Antonio truck plant assembles full-size Tundra and mid-size Tacoma pickup trucks and along with its on-site suppliers employs more than 7,200 workers at the plant complex.Separately, Aisin AW said it was investing $400 million in a future facility to produce automatic transmisions for Toyota and other automakers that will employ 900 people in Cibolo, Texas.Texas Governor Greg Abbott praised the investment announcements, which came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington had struck trade agreements with Tokyo that could be implemented without congressional approval.But Trump’s announcement left unclear whether he had agreed not to impose threatened national security tariffs on Japanese vehicles and auto parts. Avoiding the “Section 232�� tariffs of up to 25% was a major motivating factor for Tokyo in negotiating with Washington on trade.Over much of the past year, the scope of talks has narrowed to exclude the automotive sector, the source of most of the $67 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in August announced an agreement in principle on a deal that covered reductions in tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods, but not autos. Abe has repeatedly emphasized the significant U.S. investments of Japanese automakers and parts manufacturers to Trump.	-0.9339657059
BEIJING (Reuters) - New energy vehicle (NEV) sales in China surged 26% on year to 109,000 units in August for their second consecutive month of gain, a promising sign for automakers that have invested heavily in the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles (EVs).For the full year, NEV sales are likely to reach 1.1 million vehicles, down around 11% from last year, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) on Thursday.NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.“The sales rebound was fuelled by rural NEV sales promotion events and local governments�� support,�� said senior CAAM official Chen Shihua.EV makers from home-grown Nio Inc NIO.N and Xpeng Inc XPEV.N to U.S. leader Tesla Inc TSLA.O are expanding manufacturing capacity in China where the government heavily promotes greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.“There was a new-car effect in August, as a new mini EV model from GM’s local venture and Tesla’s Model 3 both sold well,�� said senior LMC Automotive analyst Alan Kang. “Sales at EV startups like Nio and Xpeng were stable too.”NEV sales in coming months will be around same as in August, Kang said.China’s overall auto sales in August rose 11.6% to 2.19 million vehicles from the same month a year earlier, the fifth consecutive month of gain as China comes off lows hit during the coronavirus lockdown in the first few months of the year.Sales are still down 9.7% for the first eight months of the year at 14.55 million vehicles, CAAM said.Sales of trucks and other commercial vehicles, which constitute around a quarter of the market, surged 41.6%, driven by government investment in infrastructure and as buyers upgraded to comply with tougher emissions rules.Sales of passenger vehicles rose 6%.Automakers that reported sales growth in August include Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd 0175.HK and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. The main local joint ventures of Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and General Motors Co GM.N, however, saw sales slide last month.	1.244430788
BOSTON (Reuters) - Car hacking is not a new field, but its secrets have long been closely guarded. That is about to change, thanks to two well-known computer software hackers who got bored finding bugs in software from Microsoft and Apple.Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek say they will publish detailed blueprints of techniques for attacking critical systems in the Toyota Prius and Ford Escape in a 100-page white paper, following several months of research they conducted with a grant from the U.S. government.The two “white hats�� - hackers who try to uncover software vulnerabilities before criminals can exploit them - will also release the software they built for hacking the cars at the Def Con hacking convention in Las Vegas this week.They said they devised ways to force a Toyota Prius to brake suddenly at 80 miles an hour, jerk its steering wheel, or accelerate the engine. They also say they can disable the brakes of a Ford Escape traveling at very slow speeds, so that the car keeps moving no matter how hard the driver presses the pedal.“Imagine what would happen if you were near a crowd,�� said Valasek, director of security intelligence at consulting firm IOActive, known for finding bugs in Microsoft Corp’s Windows software.But it is not as scary as it may sound at first blush.They were sitting inside the cars using laptops connected directly to the vehicles�� computer networks when they did their work. So they will not be providing information on how to hack remotely into a car network, which is what would typically be needed to launch a real-world attack.The two say they hope the data they publish will encourage other white-hat hackers to uncover more security flaws in autos so they can be fixed.“I trust the eyes of 100 security researchers more than the eyes that are in Ford and Toyota,�� said Miller, a Twitter security engineer known for his research on hacking Apple Inc’s App Store.Toyota Motor Corp spokesman John Hanson said the company was reviewing the work. He said the carmaker had invested heavily in electronic security, but that bugs remained - as they do in cars of other manufacturers.“It’s entirely possible to do,�� Hanson said, referring to the newly exposed hacks. “Absolutely we take it seriously.”Ford Motor Co spokesman Craig Daitch said the company takes seriously the electronic security of its vehicles. He said the fact that Miller’s and Valasek’s hacking methods required them to be inside the vehicle they were trying to manipulate mitigated the risk.“This particular attack was not performed remotely over the air, but as a highly aggressive direct physical manipulation of one vehicle over an elongated period of time, which would not be a risk to customers and any mass level,�� Daitch said.‘TIME TO SHORE UP DEFENSES’Miller and Valasek said they did not research remote attacks because that had already been done.A group of academics described ways to infect cars using Bluetooth systems and wireless networks in 2011. But unlike Miller and Valasek, the academics have kept the details of their work a closely guarded secret, refusing even to identify the make of the car they hacked. (reut.rs/NWOPjq)Their work got the attention of the U.S. government. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has begun an auto cybersecurity research program.“While increased use of electronic controls and connectivity is enhancing transportation safety and efficiency, it brings a new challenge of safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities,�� the agency said in a statement. It said it knew of no consumer incident where a vehicle was hacked.Still, some experts believe malicious hackers may already have the ability to launch attacks.“It’s time to shore up the defenses,�� said Tiffany Strauchs Rad, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab, who previously worked for an auto security research center.A group of European computer scientists had been scheduled to present research on hacking the locks of luxury vehicles, including Porsches, Audis, Bentleys and Lamborghinis, at a conference in Washington in mid-August.But Volkswagen AG obtained a restraining order from a British high court prohibiting discussion of the research by Flavio D.

Hendrick Motorsports driver William Byron won his third eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series race in the last four weeks -- taking advantage of four later tires and making a dramatic surge to the lead in the waning laps and holding off Christopher Bell at the finish line for the victory in Sunday’s Finish Line 150 at virtual Dover International Speedway.Although it took that push in the final laps to secure the win, the 22-year old Charlotte native led the most laps (79) on the day, which was quite an accomplishment considering the event featured a very Dover-like nine caution flags.“It was a lot of fun today,�� said Byron, who drives the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet in the NASCAR Cup Series. “Obviously there was a lot of cautions, so I just had to kind of pace myself. It was hard to predict when we were going to get a longer run so it’s hard to know what to do with the tires in terms of how much to save, whatnot.“My help there, Nick (Ottinger), Matt Holden, did a great job of really kind of leaving the strategy up to them as far as what tires to take. I think four tires at the end was the right call to be aggressive. Just thankful for their support and ready to get back to our normal racing here soon.”Bell’s runner-up showing in the No. 95 Leavine Family Racing Toyota was his best finish -- and first top 10 -- in the six eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series races to date. Timmy Hill, who battled Byron for much of the race, finished third -- his fifth top-three finish in six races. Hill took only two tires on his last stop, which ultimately allowed Byron to pass him with six laps to go. Joe Gibbs Racing driver Erik Jones was fourth, followed by Front Row Motorsports�� Michael McDowell, both earning their first top-five finishes in the virtual series as well.JGR driver Denny Hamlin -- winner of the inaugural series race at virtual Homestead-Miami Speedway -- finished sixth with Team Penske’s Ryan Blaney, last week’s virtual Talladega Superspeedway winner Alex Bowman, Rick Ware Racing’s Garrett Smithley and Stewart-Haas Racing’s Aric Almirola rounding out the top 10.The eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series was created to give both competitors and fans a way to enjoy the sport during the country’s downtime fighting the COVID-19 coronavirus.Next week’s race at the historic North Wilkesboro Speedway -- no longer on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule -- will be the last virtual race, however.NASCAR announced this past Thursday it would return to real-time competition on May 17 at Darlington Raceway.There will be a pair of NASCAR Cup Series events at Darlington -- on May 17 and 20 -- and then at Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 24 and May 27. There will be no practices and only one qualifying session -- for the sport’s longest race -- the May 24 Coca-Cola 600, and no fans will be allowed to attend the races at this point.But before the sport begins its initial return to real-time competition, Byron has certainly proven himself a dominant force in iRacing. His combined 406 laps led in the six races to date is more laps out front than all the other drivers combined.Although, iRacing is a completely different scenario than real time NASCAR Cup Series competition, Byron conceded the work he has put in to earn these iRacing wins against the same top-line NASCAR competition he’ll soon face on a real-time track, does have an upside.“It honestly feels really good,�� Byron said. “I feel like even though obviously it’s virtual racing, it’s a very similar platform to what we do. The physics and geometry of everything is similar.“What gives me confidence is the fact that in pressure situations, being able to deliver under those is critical in a real race car because everyone can go real fast, but it comes down to the strategy and execution of that.“It gives me a lot of confidence in the heated moments of the race. I’m excited to bring that back over to the real race car.”Hill, who has perhaps been Byron’s top competitor these weeks, was still smiling on the FOX broadcast even after being overtaken for the win.“I knew I was a sitting duck,�� Hill said. “We came up short again, but William did a great job throughout the iRace. I just want to win again.”He’ll have that chance Sunday at the historic North Wilkesboro (N.C.) Speedway -- a .625-mile oval that has featured some of NASCAR’s most iconic racing and racing names. In fact, FOX Sports NASCAR analyst Jeff Gordon -- a four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion and member of the NASCAR Hall of Fame -- said he was seriously considering competing next week. He is the last driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race at the track in 1996 before it closed down.It all makes for a highly-anticipated closure to the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series and an enthusiastic send-off for the return to real-time racing in just two weeks.“I’m excited,�� Byron said of the 2020 season resumption. “Obviously, we’re going to have to be careful health-wise, really take care of ourselves. That starts with us as drivers to make sure that we’re being smart and things of that nature.“When it comes to the racing I’m honestly just very excited because it kind of goes back to your roots as a driver of when you show up and you race, maybe you have a few laps of practice, but ultimately you get in the car and drive.“I’m looking forward to that aspect of the race, not really being there for a long time, but just getting out there and driving.��--By NASCAR Wire Service.

July 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will slash daily output by 16 percent in October, compared with the average from January to May, as the government terminates subsidies for fuel-efficient vehicles, the Nikkei reported.Subsidies have helped domestic production this year, but the program is winding down, prompting Japan’s top automaker to cut daily production by 500 units in August and 900 units in September from its earlier plan, the business daily said.Toyota will likely meet its annual domestic production target of 3.4 million units, helped by better-than-expected output in the first half of the year, the Nikkei said.	13.74982761

Google executives never miss a chance to talk up the futuristicself-driving cars the company is developingExecutive Chairman Eric Schmidt gave an update on Google’s automotive efforts during a chit-chat with reporters at the Allen &amp; Co conference in Sun Valley on Thursday.“We have had conversations with all of the manufacturers globally, when politicians come by we love to put them in the car and drive them around at full blast,�� Schmidt said.Schmidt even revealed that Google maintains a little race course in a parking lot, where drivers can try to outgun the self-driving cars (typically a modified Toyota Prius).“We ask you to race the Prius, inevitably the Prius wins against you,�� said Schmidt.The technology is not yet completely “mature,�� Schmidt explained. And Google hasn’t figured out how it will “productize�� the cars, perhaps licensing the technology to other companies.But Schmidt was fervent that the self-driving cars will eventually make their way into the real world, predicting that “self driving cars should in our lifetime become the predominant way.��	5.800130634
CHICAGO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Takata Corp’s U.S. business on Wednesday halted lawsuits for 90 days against automakers brought by victims of its faulty air bag inflators.Takata requested a six-month stay of the lawsuits, arguing an injunction was needed so management could complete a $1.6 billion sale of the company’s viable operations to Key Safety Systems and replace air bag inflators that are subject to the biggest recall in automotive history. Major automakers including BMW AG, Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp argued in favor of the six-month pause.	5.509196949
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T looked set to retain its title as the world's top-selling carmaker in the first half of this year, company figures showed on Friday, outpacing General Motors and Volkswagen as it boosted overseas sales to a record high.The Japanese automaker said its groupwide global sales for the first six months totaled 4.911 million vehicles. That was down 1.1 percent from a year earlier due to weaker Japan sales following the end of green car subsidies, but sales in the United States, its biggest market, were strong.By comparison, General Motors Co's GM.N January-June sales rose 4 percent to more than 4.85 million cars and light trucks, while Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE climbed 5.5 percent to 4.7 million vehicles, those companies reported earlier this month.Volkswagen’s sales figure, however, excludes its Scania and MAN brands. Scania sold 37,980 vehicles during the same period, while the MAN figure will be released later this month. In recent years, MAN has sold around 60,000 to 70,000 vehicles in the first half of the year.Toyota regained the global sales crown last year after slipping to third place behind GM and Volkswagen in 2011, when its supply chain was hit by naturals disasters in Japan and Thailand and after a series of recalls tarnished its reputation for quality. Previously, it had been on top from 2008 through 2010.Toyota's groupwide total includes sales at Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd 7262.T and Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T.Toyota, based in central Japan, last year made about 40 percent of its vehicles in Japan and exported nearly 60 percent of that. It has benefited from a weaker yen that allows it to export cars more profitably.Toyota, which is scheduled to announce quarterly results on August 2, is expected to post an 84 percent year-on-year rise in operating profit to 649 billion yen ($6.5 billion) and an operating profit margin of 10.8 percent, according to analyst forecasts. The results would likely outpace those of No. 2 Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and third-ranked Honda Motor Co 7267.T.	0.5622941602
(Reuters) - Estonian Ott Tanak won Rally Finland for Toyota on Sunday while Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville finished ninth but retained the overall world championship lead.The victory, over gravel roads in the fastest round of the calendar, was Tanak’s second of the season after Argentina in April and he won by 32.7 seconds.Tanak also won the final power stage for a bonus five points.Norwegian Mads Ostberg was second for Citroen, denying Toyota a one-two finish by beating Finland’s Jari-Matti Latvala by 2.8 seconds.France’s reigning champion Sebastien Ogier was fifth for M-Sport Ford.After eight of 13 rounds, Neuville has a 21 point lead over Ogier with the Belgian on 153 -- and picking up two power stage points -- and his rival now on 132.Hyundai lead M-Sport in the constructors�� standings by 26 points.“Road position has really dictated a lot this weekend,�� said Neuville. “Even without our mistake on Friday, when we misread a pace note, I don’t think we would have been any higher up the classification.“The main target was not losing too many points to Ogier, which we did to the best of our ability. We could only control what’s in our hands. We gave it everything we could in the Power Stage and it was good to take a couple of extra points.”The next round is in Germany on Aug 16-19.	-5.556378723

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards.The announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making cars “greener�� as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years.Toyota is also stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars, in a shift from an earlier strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles.“We need to take an aggressive approach to deal with changing regulations,�� Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota’s powertrain division, told reporters at a briefing.Toyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform.By 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the United States, Europe and China will feature new components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said.Toyota’s hybrid push comes as regulators require automakers to produce more electric cars, while hybrid technology, introduced in the Toyota Prius nearly 20 years ago, is increasingly considered as conventional technology.But Mizushima said that hybrid technology would be key to developing more zero-emission vehicles.“The core technology of plug-in hybrids and electric and fuel-cell vehicles is based on hybrid technology. By increasing our hybrid team, we can leverage new developments for use in electric powertrains,�� he said.Toyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars.The automaker, which sells around 10 million vehicles a year, has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050.Towards this end, Mizushima said that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota’s global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.	-1.095010703

* U.S. exec: Toyota unlikely to ‘fractionalize�� Lexus output* Sees no reason yet to boost Prius capacity* Toyota redesigning Lexus vehiclesNEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to assemble the Lexus ES 350 sedan at its Kentucky plant in 2015, marking the first time the Japanese automaker has built a vehicle from its luxury lineup in the United States.Toyota said on Friday it will invest $360 million at the Georgetown factory, which makes the Toyota Camry and other models. The move will create 750 new jobs and boost the plant’s production capacity by 10 percent to 550,000 vehicles.Expanding U.S. production fits in with Toyota’s strategy to make cars in the markets where its customers live. The move also counters the effect of the strong yen, which has made exporting from Japan expensive.“This decision is in line with two key goals,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda said at a news conference in New York. “First, to serve our U.S. customers. And second, reduce the effect of the exchange rate on our customers.”The U.S. market is the world’s largest for luxury vehicles. In an interview, Jim Lentz, head of Toyota’s North American operations, predicted economic growth of about 2 percent, similar to 2012.Toyota was offered $146.5 million worth of tax breaks from Kentucky to add production capacity at the Georgetown plant, a source previously said.“If you look at Kentucky, it’s our oldest plant,�� Lentz said, when asked if the ES could be made in any other Toyota plant in North America.“We have the most experienced team members working in that plant,�� he said. “So I think it will be Kentucky. I don’t see us fractionalizing Lexus in different plants.”Toyoda declined to comment on about whether other models, including the Prius, could be built in the U.S. market.“In the case of Prius, if I look at the sum of global demand and the sum of global supply, right now they are in sync,�� Lentz said. “There is really no compelling reason to build more capacity until we can forecast more demand.”Lexus launched the brand in the 1990s and was embraced by American “baby boomers��, but the brand has been struggling to attract younger buyers.As a result, Lexus is overhauling the design of its vehicles to compete with the likes of Hyundai Motor Co. Since 2012, Lexus has been using a pinched-in-the-middle “spindle�� grille on models, including the GS, ES and RX.“Now as a part of our global expansion, we have to speak to a broader audience,�� said Mark Templin, executive vice president of Lexus. “And what better way to do that than to put a much stronger and sharper focus on design.”The ES sedan was the second most popular Lexus model in the United States last year after the RX sport utility vehicle. The ES accounted for 9.2 percent for entry-level U.S. luxury car sales in 2012, according to data from Kelley Blue Book.The company does not sell the ES in Japan, but makes the model at a Kyushu plant in southern Japan. That plant will continue to build the ES and export it to other regions besides North America.Toyota will start producing a new model in late 2014 in Kyushu, the automaker said in a statement, without specifying the model name.In New York, Toyoda said it is moving production to avoid problems such as the supply disruptions it faced in March 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan. Converting overseas profits back into the yen has pinched profits. The yen’s decline since last year has not affected that strategy.	14.63066916
TOKYO (Reuters) - For weeks, Olympic organizers have relentlessly pushed a consistent message: The Summer Games in Tokyo will not be canceled or postponed.“Cancellation or delay of the Games would be unacceptable for the athletes,�� Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto said recently.But behind the scenes, sponsors who have pumped billions of dollars into the Games have grown increasingly nervous about how the coronavirus outbreak will impact the tournament.When organizers and sponsors met privately to discuss preparations last Wednesday, the companies learned there had been no decision on whether - or when - there would be any change to the Games.“A lot of people are starting to worry, but there’s nothing much we can do,�� a representative of an Olympic sponsor, who was present at the previously unreported meeting, told Reuters.“If this continues into April, May, June, it will be an issue, but we’re still waiting to see what will happen,�� added the representative, who was not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified.The meetings between the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee and “partner companies��, including sponsors, take place regularly. There were dozens of people present at the one last week.“Nothing has been decided. On the inside, it’s a mess,�� said a person briefed on the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.The final decision belongs to the powerful International Olympic Committee chief, Thomas Bach. Companies such as Coca-Cola Co KO.N, Bridgestone Corp 5108.T , Canon Inc 7751.T, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T sponsor the Games, and Japanese brands have for decades been some of the most generous.The IOC said on Wednesday that “preparations for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 are continuing as planned��.Tokyo 2020 Olympics chief Yoshiro Mori said his team was not considering changing plans for the games.“It is our basic stance that we press ahead with preparation for a safe and secure Olympics,�� Mori told reporters at a news conference.The meeting last week brought into focus the scale of what organizers are grappling with: pressure to avoid a coronavirus crisis among 600,000 expected spectators and athletes at an event that could see $3 billion in sponsorships and at least $12 billion spent on preparations evaporate.Haruyuki Takahashi, one of more than two dozen members of the board of the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, told Reuters it had just started working on scenarios for how the virus could affect the Games. But a sponsor representative at the meeting last week said those plans were not being shared with the companies.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has staked his legacy as the longest-serving Japanese leader on staging a successful Games and bringing a massive jolt, estimated at $2.3 billion, to the stagnant economy with tourism and consumer spending.Some Olympic qualifiers and test events have been relocated or delayed. The Games themselves don’t start until late July, leaving some time for the organizers to make the final call.Neal Pilson, the former head of CBS Sports, who was involved in broadcasting rights negotiations for three Winter Olympics, said he expected organizers to assess the situation by early May at the latest, when they “will have a better fix on whether the epidemic is tapering down or continuing to expand��.Olympic Minister Hashimoto said the end of May was a possible time-frame for a decision.Organizers have begun to modify their tone. Tokyo 2020’s Mori, while vehemently denying the Games would be canceled, added at the news conference: “I am not saying there won’t be any impact. I think there will be. On that, specialists in each field are looking into what to do.”�SERIOUSLY THREATENED’Last week, Hashimoto was questioned in parliament on a clause in the contract between the IOC and the organizers in Japan that determines when the Olympic committee could terminate the Games.One of the scenarios is the inability of the host city to hold the Olympics in 2020.The mention of the clause touched off speculation that the minister was hinting at a delay, which sponsors at last week’s meeting were told sparked the ire of the IOC.As a result, Hashimoto called senior members of the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee to explain how she was “misunderstood.”According to the contract, the Tokyo metropolitan government, the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee and the Japanese Olympic Committee signed away any right to indemnity, damages or compensation from the IOC.The contract says the IOC may scrap the Games when safety is “seriously threatened��, among other reasons.Those three bodies have formed a task-force on the virus that consults closely with the World Health Organization, which last week warned against “false hopes�� that the virus would disappear with warmer summer weather.Many sports in Japan, such as rugby and sumo, have held recent matches without spectators.Although keeping spectators away would cost an estimated $800 million in lost ticket sales, it could still provide billions in revenue from broadcast and marketing rights.But experts said it would still be difficult to organize a safe Games with thousands of athletes living in close proximity.“In the Olympic village alone, you’re bringing together 17,000-18,000 people, they’re living in close quarters, interacting with each other, coming from all over the world,�� said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College specializing in sports economics.A Tokyo 2020 official involved in the discussions said that delaying the games until later in the year would be difficult.Takahashi, of the organizing committee, said a one- or two-year delay would better accommodate professional sports schedules, which are planned years in advance.“We need to start preparing for any possibility. If the Games can’t be held in the summer, a delay of one or two years would be most feasible,�� Takahashi said.	-1.246029807
* Chrysler brand withdraws after partner Penske Racing shifts to Ford* Decision leaves Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet as chief rivalsAug 7 (Reuters) - Chrysler’s Dodge brand said Tuesday it will withdraw from NASCAR stock-car racing at the end of the 2012 season, following a decision earlier this year by partner Penske Racing to switch to Ford from Dodge in 2013.Penske Racing, which is using two Dodge Chargers this year in NASCAR’s premier Sprint Cup series, is ending a 10-year relationship with Dodge, a unit of Italian automaker Fiat .Dodge, which had returned to NASCAR in 2001 after a long absence from the sport, had developed a new racing version of the Charger designed to meet the sanctioning body’s new rules for the 2013 season. A prototype of the new Charger race car was unveiled in mid-March prior to a NASCAR race in Las Vegas.Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors Co’s Chevrolet all have prepared new race cars for NASCAR’s 2013 Sprint Cup series that bear a resemblance to production cars but use specialized engines, suspensions and other major components developed exclusively for racing.Chrysler executive Ralph Gilles, head of the automaker’s SRT Motorsports group, said the decision was based less on financial considerations than on practicality, given the withdrawal of Penske, Dodge’s sole partner team in NASCAR.	0.9019026439
MATSUE, Japan (Reuters) - A Bank of Japan board member with a casting vote on policy decisions said the central bank must consider “preventive steps�� against economic risks, a sign its nine-member board may be tilting toward further easing as global pressures intensify.In a speech on Thursday, Yukitoshi Funo - who has consistently voted with the majority of the nine-member board and holds a neutral stance - stressed the BOJ’s resolve to act without hesitation if economic hazards increase.Market expectations of imminent easing grew after Governor Haruhiko Kuroda pledged in July to act preemptively.Funo, a former executive of Toyota Motor 7203.T, highlighted the risks from overseas, such as U.S. economic policy and its impact on global markets, the Sino-U.S. trade war, Brexit, and geopolitical strife.Kuroda could team up with Funo, along with three reflationist board members including deputy governor Masazumi Wakatabe, to swing the votes in the divided board in favor of easing as early as its next meeting on Oct. 30-31.The BOJ needs to examine how various events would affect the output gap, and act preemptively before they materialize, Funo said.“It would be too late (to act) when the outcome appears. In that sense foreseeing is a factor we should focus on,�� Funo told a news conference after meeting with business leaders in Matsue, western Japan.“We need to make a decision while taking preventive policy measures into account,�� Funo told reporters.At its latest policy review last month, the central bank stood pat but signaled the chance of expanding stimulus as early as its next policy meeting in October by issuing a stronger warning against overseas risks.“We are facing a situation where we need to pay more attention than before to the risk that the momentum toward the price stability target will be undermined,�� Funo said.“With that situation in mind, we will reexamine economic and price trends at the next policy setting meeting,�� he added.Funo said various options can be considered to further ease policy, such as cutting short-term and long-term interest rates, boosting asset purchases and accelerating base money expansion, or a combination of these.“In particular, protectionist moves are fuelling uncertainty,�� Funo said. “As the global economy remains unstable, attention must be paid to these risks and their effects on Japanese business and households�� sentiment.”Under a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ pledges to guide short-term rates at -0.1% and the 10-year bond yield around 0%. It also buys risky assets to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target.Sources say the BOJ will stick to its playbook of minor tweaks and verbal warnings to rein in sharp falls in long-term interest rates, raising questions about its ability to control the yield curve while managing market expectations.The BOJ has said it has four tools to ease, namely lowering the long-term bond yield target, increasing asset purchases, accelerating base money printing and deepening negative rates. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has made clear the central bank won’t rule out any of the options, including deepening negative rates, if it were to ease again.However, with interest rates already near zero, many analysts say the central bank is in a bind given it has little ammunition to battle the next recession.	7.134146341
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group representing many major automakers on Friday backed the Trump administration’s decision to weaken Obama administration fuel efficiency standards but said it opposed further reductions in requirements.In March, the Trump administration issued final rules requiring 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - far weaker than the 5% increases in the discarded Obama-era rules - but abandoned its August 2018 proposal to freeze requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Toyota Motor Corp and others -- on Friday intervened in a litigation on behalf of the Trump administration, saying it believed the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration “lawfully exercised their discretion in setting their standards in accordance with the applicable statutory requirements.”The group added the new standards “properly balance improvement in fuel economy and (greenhouse gas) emissions performance.The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) in April asked a federal appeals court to order the administration to reconsider its plan, saying it should have further reduced or frozen the requirements. The group argues the agencies “failed to adequately consider the adverse traffic safety impacts of their chosen fuel economy standards.”The auto group opposed CEI’s legal challenge.Five automakers -- including Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE -- that announced separate agreements with California on fuel economy standards in 2019 are not participating in the legal intervention.Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, criticized the automakers�� announcement, noting they previously intervened on behalf of the Trump administration in support of a separate regulation to strip California of its right to set emissions rules.“The American auto industry can either lead or be led,�� she said.California and 22 other U.S. states also plan to challenge the March rewrite, saying the administration should not have relaxed the Obama rules.	3.239062122
DETROIT, March 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will use artificial intelligence in new research to speed up the discovery of advanced battery materials and fuel-cell catalysts to power electric and other emission-free vehicles, the company said on Thursday.Toyota will invest around $35 million in its North American research arm, the Toyota Research Institute (TRI) and will involve collaboration with a number of U.S. academic institutions including the University of Michigan and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and British material sciences company Ilika Plc.Automakers have been investing heavily in developing new batteries and fuel cells to increase the range of electric vehicles. China in particular is banking on the heavy use of electric vehicles in the future.Brian Storey, the lead TRI researcher for the new program, said artificial intelligence will be used to identify new possible materials for batteries and fuel and run computer tests to narrow down the field for simulation tests by researchers.Storey said the research will pursue a replacement for platinum as a fuel-cell catalyst.“We don’t have a ton of platinum on this planet and it costs a lot money,�� he said. “Platinum is a great catalyst, but is there another compound out there that uses little platinum or no platinum at all?�� (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)	-0.2946050451

NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of foreign companies fell on Wednesday, pressured by losses in stocks of Asian companies as investors awaited crucial economic data from China later this week, while further gains in the yen spurred profit-taking in Japanese equities after their recent rally.Japanese exporters, which had been big outperformers recently, were the day’s biggest decliners. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index shed 2.6 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day drop in eight months.The Nikkei lost 278.64 points to 10,600.44, a day after hitting a 32-month high. It also dropped out of “overbought territory,�� with its 14-day relative strength index coming back under the 70 mark for the first time since Dec. 21.U.S.-listed shares of Toyota Motor Corp fell 1.8 percent to $94.64 and Canon Inc shares were down 2.7 percent at $37.10.The yen, which has fallen more than 1 percent against the dollar so far this year, rebounded for a second day on Wednesday after a Japanese government official said further softness in the yen could harm importers and fuel costs.The BNY Mellon index of leading American depositary receipts fell 0.5 percent, while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index ended flat.The BNY Mellon index of leading European ADRs fell 0.5 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co and Mazda Motor Corp said they are expanding last year’s massive recalls involving potentially explosive air bags supplied by Takata Corp, after a similar move by Toyota Motor Corp this month.Honda is recalling about 2.03 million vehicles globally, in addition to the 1.135 million it had called back in April 2013, the Japanese carmaker said on Monday.Mazda said it is recalling 159,807 vehicles worldwide.	1.885343798
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it will recall almost 1.6 million additional U.S. vehicles for front passenger side Takata air bag inflators that could rupture.Earlier this month, Takata Corp 7312.T said it was declaring another 35 million to 40 million U.S. inflators defective at the urging of U.S. regulators, a move that more than doubles the number of inflators recalled. Faulty Takata inflators have been linked to more than 100 injuries and 13 deaths worldwide.Toyota said the new recall includes some but not all Corolla, Matrix, Yaris, 4Runner, Sienna, Scion xB, Lexus ES, GX and IS vehicles built between 2006 and 2011.Toyota said it has now recalled 4.73 million vehicles in the United States for Takata air bags.Other reports from the 17 automakers now recalling Takata vehicles are due this week.On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Daimler AG DAIGn.DE said another 197,000 vehicles in the United States will need to be recalled -- but all have been recalled in previous driver-side airbag calls.Last week, Takata filed reports with U.S. auto safety regulators declaring nearly 14 million air bag inflators defective -- in the first of a series of required reports. Takata agreed to expand recalls by 35 million to 40 million inflators in several tranches through 2019, adding to the 28.8 million recalled before May 4.This is the largest recall in U.S. auto safety history. Malfunctioning Takata air bag inflators can explode with too much force, sending shrapnel into vehicles.Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Tesla Motors Inc TSLA.O, Fisker Automotive and Jaguar Land Rover will recall Takata air bag inflators, bringing the number of automakers involved to 17, including Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI.Jaguar Land Rover is a Tata Motors Ltd brand.	9.250794913
TOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is hitching its future to green cars, investing billions of dollars in gasoline-electric hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles, but for now its record profit performance is being powered largely by a gas-guzzling U.S. market.In the United States, relatively cheap gasoline prices helped to spur brisk 9 percent growth in industry-wide light truck sales in the first half of the year, making that one of the fastest-growing major global market segments - accounting for about one-tenth of global vehicle sales.Toyota outperformed the overall U.S. market, moreover, with its fresh model line-up - the Highlander SUV was redesigned in February and the Tundra pick-up got a facelift last September - powering a 10 percent rise in its January-June U.S. light truck sales to nearly half a million vehicles.That success is feeding the nearly $40 billion cash pile that Toyota will tap for future green car investments.“The U.S. is one of the few bright spots contributing to year-on-year profit growth for Toyota while it faces a slowdown in places like Japan and Thailand,�� said Koichi Sugimoto, an auto analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley.Light trucks, a category that includes SUVs, accounted for around 42 percent of Toyota’s total U.S. sales in January-June, which were up 5 percent from a year earlier.The strong showing continued in July, when Toyota’s total U.S. sales rose 12 percent due to robust SUV demand and larger discounts, outperforming the industry’s 9 percent growth and surpassing Ford Motor Co to become the No.2 seller for the month.Analysts forecast that Toyota’s April-June North American operating profit jumped at a double-digit rate from the same period a year ago, with Barclays auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida putting the figure at 106 billion yen ($1.03 billion), up 30 percent year-on-year. The company will announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.Toyota’s North America numbers undercount the region’s actual contribution to profits, since they exclude much of the profits made from imported vehicles. Most of what Toyota earns through exports from its home country are counted with Japan profits, which likely fell in April-June due to a sales tax hike in April that dented domestic sales.Barclays�� Yoshida forecasts Toyota’s Japan operating profit at 381 billion yen for the quarter, a 16 percent drop. In Asia, he expects a 12 percent decline to 92 billion yen.Overall operating profit at the world’s biggest automaker is expected to drop 4 percent in April-June to 637.3 billion yen from the same period a year ago, according to the average forecast of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.For the full year to next March, Toyota forecasts its profit will edge up 0.3 percent to 2.3 trillion yen, extending last year’s record high.Bigger vehicles such as light trucks tend to be more profitable than small cars.For this financial year, Toyota is likely to make an operating profit of around $2,500 on average for every light truck such as the RAV4 or Tundra it sells in the United States. The figure for passenger cars such as the Prius or the Camry, Toyota’s best-selling car in the United States, is about $1,500, said Koichi Sugimoto, an auto analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley.While Toyota reaps hefty profits from U.S. light trucks, its sales of the Prius, the world’s best-selling hybrid car, slumped 11 percent in the United States in the first half of the year.Unlike Toyota’s U.S. light truck line-up, the flagship Prius has not seen a model change in five years. But its fortunes are set for a boost as Toyota readies a fourth generation of the hybrid to hit showrooms as early as next year.Toyota introduced the Prius in late 1997 and endured years of losses to establish dominance in the segment. After selling more than 6 million hybrids over 17 years, Toyota says it is now earning money on the Prius and aims to make its hybrids as profitable as its gasoline-engine cars.Toyota will further burnish its image as a green technology pioneer next year when it readies a fuel-cell vehicle for launch by end-March.But for the rest of this financial year, it’s big gasoline-engine vehicles that will be underpinning Toyota’s profits.“They are 15 percent share of the U.S. market and they’ve got to sell what the market buys, for sure,�� said Kurt Sanger, autos analyst at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Automakers, not technology companies, are in the driver’s seat in developing self-driving, “autonomous�� cars, and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is best positioned to lead the way, according to a new report on patents for the fast-evolving technology. As automakers enter agreements with Silicon Valley companies to develop self-driving cars, Tesla Motor Inc TSLA.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O would make logical partners, the report says. The report, by the Intellectual Property and Science division of Thomson Reuters TRI.TO, is based on a detailed analysis of patent filings by automakers and tech companies for autonomous-car technology. (tmsnrt.rs/1OxPQ3P)The findings illuminate the challenges for both established automakers and Silicon Valley companies as they compete to profit from moving people around in a world that is increasingly congested and concerned about carbon emissions.The global auto industry is in the midst of three simultaneous, and interconnected, technology revolutions. The first is the quest for cleaner alternatives to internal-combustion engines. The second involves connectivity and linking cars to information or data services. Lastly, the autonomy revolution is the effort to develop self-driving cars that could enable services in which electric cars connected to the Web can be summoned to provide rides on demand.“Automakers aren’t as good as technology companies in tooting their own horns,�� Tony Trippe, principal author of the report, told Reuters in an interview. “But when you look at the patent data, the automakers are all over this.”Toyota is, far and away, the global leader in the number of self-driving car patents, the report found. Toyota is followed by Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], Japan’s Denso Corp 6902.T, Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and General Motors Co GM.N. The tech company with the most autonomous-driving patents, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, ranks 26th on the list.The report from the Thomson Reuters unit comes as auto and technology industry executives are gathering at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where alliances to advance autonomous driving and connected vehicles will be central topics.GM said on Monday it will invest $500 million in Lyft Inc as it forges a Detroit-Silicon Valley partnership with the ride-sharing service to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars.Toyota, the Thomson Reuters report found, has more than 1,400 patents on autonomous-driving devices, more than twice as many as any other company. One recent Toyota patent application, for example, is for software that avoids a car’s self-driving system being switched off, and thus defaulting to “manual mode�� in which the driver controls the car, unless the driver intends to turn off the system.The raw number of patents does not necessarily equate to leadership in developing self-driving cars, Trippe said. Non-U.S. companies tend to be more aggressive in filing patent applications than American companies. The quality of patents is also important, since not all are created equal.Another potential limitation of the report is the 18-month lag time between patent filings and when the filings are published for the public.In reality, driverless-car development will require alliances between automakers and technology companies, even though both sides will try to gain the upper hand in partnerships.A Toyota spokesman said the automaker views a fully self-driving car as a long term goal, but one that must wait for autonomous driving systems that never make a mistake. In the meantime, Toyota is accelerating efforts to equip cars with automatic braking and other safety systems that can help avoid crashes.Most experts say fully self-driving vehicles are unlikely to be roaming roads in large numbers for many years yet. Google has been testing self-driving cars since 2009, though, and automakers such as Daimler DAIGn.DE, BMW BMWG.DE and Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE Audi unit have revealed cars that can travel long distances without human intervention.Trippe said Apple and Tesla would make logical partners in autonomous cars because they have complementary, not duplicative patents. Tesla’s strength is propulsion technology, notably batteries, while Apple’s is in electronic navigation and communication systems.As the race to develop self-driving cars heats up, automakers are also introducing more “semi-autonomous�� driving systems that handle tedious or tricky situations. Audi, for instance, is expected to use the CES show to outline progress on a system that allows cars to pilot themselves in traffic jams at low speeds.	-6.749450921
TOKYO (Reuters) - Hospitals in Nagoya city in Japan’s industrial heartland have more coronavirus patients than they can treat, forcing transfers to nearby areas and offering a glimpse of the challenges the outbreak poses for a country with a huge elderly population.Japan has closed schools and canceled public events, which experts say has helped prevent an explosive spread of the virus. But because testing hasn’t been widespread, some medical experts say the extent of infection is understated, and a surge could yet happen.That would put more of the country under the strain now being felt in Nagoya, and force a nationwide scramble to shift patients, many of them elderly, to hospitals in areas with capacity.“If the numbers rise further, we won’t be able to cope, so we will either have to ask nearby prefectures to help, or tell those with lighter symptoms to stay at home,�� a prefecture official in Nagoya told Reuters.Confirmed coronavirus cases in Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture, totaled 98 as of Sunday, the official said, far exceeding the city’s 27 beds at hospitals that meet conditions for patients with the highly contagious disease.Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, is Japan's second-hardest hit prefecture, with 121 confirmed coronavirus cases so far. It has a total of 161 beds capable of handling patients with such a disease. Of those, 105 were in use as of Sunday, the official said.Elderly people are especially vulnerable to serious effects the virus. Japan has the world’s oldest population, with more than 28% aged 65 or over.Italy, which has Europe’s oldest population, is facing growing concerns about the ability of its strained health system to cope with a relentless increase in new cases.“If we allow the epidemic to continue, it’s a matter of time,�� said Hokkaido University professor Hiroshi Nishiura when asked if Japan could face a situation similar to Italy’s.He added that the trajectory of the epidemic was hard to predict.Japan has been hospitalizing all patients who test positive for the virus, even if symptoms are slight, in line with its law on infectious diseases.But now, in some areas, patients with lighter symptoms are being asked to isolate at home.To free up more hospital beds, patients with non-urgent surgery will likely be asked to wait, and others may be discharged earlier than is usual in Japan, experts said.Hospitals are being asked to prepare plans for transferring patients to places that can treat them, given how the speed of the spread has varied by region, said Takuma Kato, a health ministry official.Japan’s health ministry has issued guidelines on handling an influx of coronavirus patients based on estimates of what peak numbers might look like.“Potentially, there will be a surge of new cases if Japan is not successful in containment, which I think will happen,�� said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute of Population Health, King’s College, London.“Japan is not yet at the level of what Italy is experiencing in terms of outbreak phase, but that gives us a very important lesson - we have to be prepared,�� he said.The death toll in Italy rose to 1,809 by Sunday after a 25% jump in just 24 hours. The number of cases hit 24,747.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said there were 12,000 beds nationwide that could take serious virus cases and 3,000 respirators, but Shibuya said that didn’t mean there were trained medical staff to handle all of those cases.A national action plan based on a 2012 law calls for hospitalizing severe cases and treating mild cases at home.Parliament on Friday revised that law to allow the government to declare a state of emergency to cover the coronavirus. Abe has said conditions didn’t warrant such a declaration yet.A shortage of cutting-edge equipment to treat the most severe cases also poses a risk, and could force tough decisions about whom to treat if cases rise fast, as in Italy.For example, a ventilator might be in use for a 90-year-old patient while a seriously ill 30-year-old nurse went without, said Koji Wada, a member of the government advisory panel.“So we need to discuss the ethical issues too,�� Wada said.	13.35483871
ORLANDO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of U.S. Toyota drivers have received a stern warning by first-class mail: Immediately drive to your dealer to replace a flawed air bag, and in the meantime don’t let anyone sit on the passenger side.Thousands of Chrysler drivers with similar air bags are unlikely to get a formal notification until December. Meanwhile, they can expect free tickets to Disney World in exchange for allowing their air bags to be tested.Over the past six years, at least five deaths have been linked to air bags supplied by Japanese safety equipment maker Takata that could rupture upon deployment, spraying metal shards inside the car. More than 17 million cars have been recalled worldwide, including over 11 million in the United States.The number, however, represents a patchwork of “safety improvement campaigns,�� informal “regional recalls,�� and formal recalls of certain models rather a consistent national action.Some car owners are promised immediate repairs, others are told they will have to wait, while others have not been contacted at all.Behind the confusion is carmakers�� reluctance to commit to costly repairs while they still puzzle over what makes some bags explode and the U.S. safety regulators�� inability to nudge them towards full-scale recalls.Robert Lamoureux, 47, a coordinator for an events production firm in Orlando, heard about exploding airbags on the news weeks ago and confirmed on Honda’s website that his 2002 Accord SE was among the models that should be brought to a dealer.But the site told owners to wait for a notice in the mail, which only arrived at the end of October.“They said it was an air bag issue but they didn’t describe the issue. They didn’t come out and say, yeah, you might lose your face.”All five deaths, four in the United States and one in Malaysia, have been in Honda cars.Safety advocates and lawmakers say the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and carmakers, including Honda , Toyota , Chrysler , Nissan , BMW , and Ford , were too slow and inconsistent in their response.“There is an unequivocal need for national recalls,�� Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told Reuters.Regulators acknowledge they typically rely on the industry to take the initiative in recalling vehicles, but say the threat they will investigate is usually enough to prompt a recall.“We aggressively investigate and pursue recalls to protect the American public, forcing the recall of approximately 100 million defective vehicles and equipment over the past 10 years,�� said NHTSA deputy administrator David Friedman.Critics, however, say the agency should have pressured carmakers more and sooner instead of striking a June agreement with five manufacturers that let them voluntarily collect and analyze the potentially defective parts.Furthermore, such investigations were initially limited to hot and humid regions, considered most problematic. Only last month that area of the continental U.S. states was expanded to beyond Florida to include Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana and parts of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico.The safety agency and its allies argue that limited staffing and funding restrict how much it can investigate on its own, making it hard to formally force recalls.According to law, the agency can only force an automaker issue a binding recall through a process that gives the company multiple opportunities to present counter-evidence and can take years.Some experts see merits in pushing carmakers for voluntary, targeted recalls.“By starting the recall just in the highest risk areas, all the replacement parts can be directed there first,�� said Professor John Paul MacDuffie, director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation at Wharton’s Mack Institute of Innovation Management.Yet many safety advocates argue the agency should act with greater urgency to push for a national recall to ensure consistency of carmakers�� responses.While most automakers have by now sent out letters that say “Important Safety Recall,�� what happens next still varies widely.Toyota owners, for example, are told that should the new air bag not be immediately available, dealers will disable the faulty one and leave a tag on the glove compartment telling passengers not to sit in the front until a new air bag is installed.General Motors is prepared to offer loaner cars in case of a parts shortage, said company spokesman Alan Adler.BMW notified owners about the recall in August, but told them at the time it did not have the necessary parts. A second notice in October went to owners of affected cars nationwide - not just in the states targeted by the safety regulator - telling them that new air bags were available and should be installed immediately.Honda only early this month turned its “safety improvement campaign�� into a formal recall, but did not say how many cars were affected.The mixed messages make owners wonder how worried they should be.For some, like Caitlin Knowles, a 23-year-old waitress in Winter Park, Florida, it is already the second air bag recall.Knowles brought her 2001 Honda Civic in for repairs when she was told about the air bag problems in a 2012 notice.Now she wonders if Honda will get it right this time. “It’s definitely frightening thinking about a piece of metal going through your head.��	3.904207775
BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Motor dealers and consumer groups alike expressed frustration on Thursday at a lack of information from Volkswagen about the implications for customers of a scandal involving diesel cars rigged to pass U.S. emissions.“We are getting lots of phone calls asking ‘What is the likely impact of this?’� said an insider at a major Volkswagen dealership in Britain, who declined to be named.“But we not getting anything from Volkswagen, so we don’t have anything to pass on to them.”The same was true in Frankfurt: a women at the reception desk of a VW dealership, who declined to give her name, said she had received many queries from diesel car drivers.“But we haven’t got the ultimate answer because we haven’t got much information from Volkswagen,�� she said.The German group has set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to help cover the costs of the crisis and said that 11 million of its cars could be affected worldwide, but has not yet announced a recall.VW said in a statement on its websites that it could not say which models and years of construction were affected, adding it would provide further information as soon as possible.“It goes without saying that we will take full responsibility and cover costs for the necessary arrangements and measures. But this process will take time,�� VW said.Italian consumer group Altroconsumo said it, along with similar organizations in other European countries, was planning to write to Volkswagen demanding clear information on the situation immediately.Klaus Mueller, head of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, said Volkswagen must compensate any consumers affected and retrofit all affected vehicles. “Volkswagen is called upon to comprehensively clear this up,�� he said.Lawyers have already brought class actions on behalf of scores of car owners in the United States and Italian consumer group Codacons is collecting signatures for a potential suit.Market research company YouGov said it had recorded a big hit to the VW brand in the United States and Britain, where VW has tumbled into the lowest position among 34 brands.In an attempt to reassure customers, VW said new diesel models covered by the European Union’s Euro 6 emissions standards met legal requirements. The software in question did not affect handling or consumption, or control emissions, it added.However, in a Swedish Volkswagen Golf chat room, consumers were discussing whether it will be possible to cancel recent orders, with one person saying he had been planning to purchase a hatchback, but decided never to buy VW again due to the scandal.“We expect environmentally sensitive consumers will increasingly pay attention to emissions and avoid diesel-powered cars,�� said Raffael Wuethrich, project leader for sustainability and energy at the Swiss Foundation for Consumer Protection.Tim Pollard, executive editor of Britain’s Car Magazine, agreed: “The actual topic of emissions is a bit of a dry topic, but they (consumers) do understand that it affects the tax they pay and the amount of money in their pocket.”Ernst-Robert Nouvertne, who owns VW dealerships in the German town of Solingen, said how quickly VW refitted affected cars would be critical to reassuring customers.“Customers are unsettled. It won’t just pass us by without problems. Some customers could switch to a petrol car,�� he said, but noted Volkswagen should be shielded by the loyalty of its customers, at least in its home country.Steve Young, managing director of auto industry research firm ICDP, said the experience of previous car recalls by other brands showed it could actually bring dealerships more business.Young noted how Toyota Motor Corp had recalled millions of vehicles from 2009 due to some customers�� complaints that their cars were unintentionally accelerating.“It depends on how well they manage the process... in the case of the Toyota recall in the U.S., Toyota dealers were able to reconnect with customers,�� he said.“If the dealer handles it well, they could help customers use the compensation to switch into petrol and sell their fixed diesel model to somebody who knows what they are getting.”Ansgar Klein, head of the German Association of Independent Dealerships, does not expect a lasting impact.“The Golf has not got worse. I don’t think prices will fall as a result,�� he said. “Most drivers care more about fuel consumption than emissions. The scandal has not affected trust in VW cars, although trust in the company has suffered.”Dariusz Balcerzyk from the Automotive Market Research Institute Samar in Warsaw said the same was true in Poland.“For Poles this is not really that much of an issue. For a Polish customer, it is still the price that matters most, followed by the car’s brand,�� he said.	5.754788625

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will alert about 700,000 owners of three Lexus models built over the last several years of a problem with the emergency trunk release, Consumer Reports magazine said on Wednesday.The automaker will make the announcement next month. The affected models include 2007-2013 Lexus ES mid-size sedans, 2006-2012 Lexus IS cars and the 2013 Lexus GS sedan.In these vehicles, a lever allowing a person to open the trunk from the inside was easily broken. Toyota is replacing the release with a “more robust�� polypropylene version with supporting ridges, the magazine said.Consumer Reports flagged the problem in October after the four-year-old son of the magazine’s auto testing director found the problem with the trunk lever.The lever has been mandatory since the 2002 model year. In these models, it snaps off when pulled toward the driver’s side. It works when pulled straight down or toward the passenger side.	12.71541686
JOHANNESBURG, Feb 13 (Reuters) - South Africa’s automotive sector capital expenditure is projected to rise to 8.2 billion rand ($615 million) this year from 6.4 billion rand in 2016, the auto industry body said in a document seen by Reuters.The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa said in a memo dated Feb. 7 that the sector’s estimated capex was based on details supplied by seven major car makers and data from various sources relevant to Beijing Automotive International Corporation.Car manufacturers in South Africa include Ford, Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz SA, Nissan and Toyota, among others.The automotive sector, South Africa’s largest manufacturing industry, expects a slight increase in new vehicles sales this year as economic growth gains pace thanks to commodity price rises and a recovery in farming.	-1.074517341

* More evidence that U.S. economy is gathering momentum* Sales robust despite lack of inventory for some automakers* Toyota again beats out Ford to rank No. 2 in U.S. market* Shares of Ford, GM up sharply (Adds final industry figures, analyst and industry comments, macroeconomic background, updates share prices)By Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Even as dealers sold out of some of the hottest models, U.S. auto sales raced past expectations in August, rising at their fastest pace in nearly six years, while demand showed no signs of cooling as consumers grew more confident in the economy.Vehicle sales increased 17 percent in August, and the annual sales rate in the month finished at 16.1 million vehicles. That sales pace topped analysts�� expectations of 15.8 million and marked the strongest month since October 2007, before the start of the 2008-2009 recession.Sales easily surpassed expectations as consumers, after years of putting off purchases of new cars, took advantage of still-low interest rates and snapped up a wide range of vehicles from pickup trucks to luxury sedans.Overall retail sales for August, due to be reported in the middle of the month, are currently forecast to have risen 0.3 percent from July, but the robust auto sales could indicate the current estimates are too conservative.The auto industry has held up a bit better than the broader economy, in part because consumers need to replace aging vehicles after deferring purchases in recent years. On average, vehicles are more than 11 years old, a record.“People are just tired of waiting,�� Fred Diaz, U.S. sales chief for the Nissan brand, said on Wednesday. “They need new transportation, and they’re feeling confident about the jobs and secure about their careers.”That said, the unexpected strength of August auto sales provides more evidence that the broader U.S. economy is gathering momentum coming out of the first half, when gross domestic product grew by a tepid 1.8 percent.Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at General Motors Co , said the robust sales pace in August “reflects the underlying fundamentals of the economy.”The industry benefited from the pent-up demand even though persistent inventory shortages of some models came to a head in August, traditionally a strong sales month driven by end-of-model-year clearance sales.In a survey by RBC Capital Markets, 19 percent of dealers said inventory was too low during the month of August, compared with 9 percent of dealers in July and 4 percent in June.Dealers could not keep pace even though many manufacturers were running their plants flat-out. Ford Motor Co said it is operating its North American plants at 135 percent of capacity, and six of its factories are running on three shifts.Among the models in short supply were the Ford Fusion sedan and its Escape crossover, and GM’s Chevrolet Cruze, Spark, Impala and Malibu.All major automakers reported double-digit sales increases in August, with most of them handily exceeding analysts�� estimates.GM, the No. 1 seller in the U.S. market, reported August sales up 15 percent.Chrysler Group LLC and Ford each said their August U.S. sales rose 12 percent. Both automakers reported that pickup truck models led the way, in part because of the rising housing market. Ford’s sales outstripped analyst expectations and Chrysler’s matched them.The three largest Japanese automakers in the U.S. market posted much stronger than expected sales.Toyota Motor Corp’s August sales gained 23 percent. For the second straight month, the top Japanese maker sold more vehicles in the United States than Ford, ranking Toyota No. 2 behind GM. Before July, Toyota had not topped Ford in monthly sales since March 2010.Honda Motor Co sold 27 percent more vehicles in August than last year, and Nissan Motor Co sales rose 22 percent.“The auto industry continues to be a bright spot in the economic recovery,�� said Bill Fay, Toyota division group vice president and general manager.Sales are expected to stay strong through the end of the year, most automakers said.Vehicle sales have been growing as a proportion of overall retail sales in recent months.From a post-financial crisis low of 14 percent of all retail sales in September 2009, auto sales more recently have accounted for about 17.5 percent of retail sales. Still, it is a far cry from the peak of a decade ago when auto sales typically represented more than 22 percent of all retail sales.Michigan-based LMC Automotive expects this year’s U.S. sales to finish at 15.6 million vehicles, which would mark a 7.6 percent gain from 2012.A second bright spot for the industry is the rise in average transaction prices for new vehicles, which climbed to a record $31,252 in August, said TrueCar.com, the California-based research firm.Incentives across the industry fell in August, to an average of $2,374 per vehicle from $2,455 in July, according to industry research firm Edmunds.com.The demand for luxury vehicles remains high, as seen by the 46 percent sales gain by BMW, which coming into August was just behind Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz as top luxury brand automakers. Mercedes-Benz said its August sales rose 16 percent.Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said the industry is only at the beginning of satisfying pent-up demand.Jesse Toprak, analyst with TrueCar.com, said consumers are attracted to showrooms now because of low monthly payments and “the best lease deals ever.”Toprak said he expects the robust sales rate to continue through the end of 2013, and expects fourth-quarter sales to be the strongest of the year.GM’s Mohatarem also said that the sales pace will not fade as the year nears an end.But Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book, said a shortage of some key models will put a crimp in sales growth for the rest of the year into 2014.“I don’t know if we’re going to have the inventory available to have the same kind of growth that we saw this month,�� he said.Ford sales analyst Erich Merkle said the auto industry will show a 17 percent U.S. sales gain for August, and a seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate of more than 16 million vehicles.Before the 2008-2010 industry downturn, it was routine for U.S. auto sales to top 16 million vehicles each year. In a 10-year span ending in 2007, U.S. auto sales averaged 16.7 million vehicles.Pickup truck sales remained strong in August for the major U.S. automakers, continuing a trend that began almost a year ago.Ford said it sold 71,115 F-Series pickup trucks, up 22 percent, which matches the line’s year-to-date gains.GM’s Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck sales rose 14 percent and through August increased its year-to-date sales 25 percent.Chrysler’s truck brand, Ram, showed a robust 29 percent sales gain in August, and had a year-to-date gain of 25 percent through August. Chrysler is a unit of Italy’s Fiat SpA.Bucking the upward industry-wide trend, Volkswagen AG said its sales were down 1.6 percent in the month.Ford shares were up 3.3 percent at $16.88 and GM shares were up 4.9 percent at $35.81 on the New York Stock Exchange shortly before the close of trading on Wednesday.

FLORENCE, Italy, June 13 (Reuters) - Italian carmaker Fiat SpA’s U.S. unit Chrysler is still working on a $3 billion loan refinancing, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne said on Thursday, confirming what sources had earlier told Reuters.On June 12 Reuters reported that Chrysler had set terms on a loan refinancing that could lower its borrowing costs and make it possible for Fiat to access Chrysler’s cash flow.Fiat owns 58.5 percent of Chrysler and wants to buy up the rest. Talks with the seller, an autoworkers�� union-affiliated healthcare trust, are continuing, Marchionne said on Thursday.Asked for a progress report on the Chrysler loan talks, Marchionne said: “The transaction has not yet been concluded.”The completion of an agreement is expected on June 21, Reuters had reported, citing banking sources.Fiat aims to complete the transaction, merge the two carmakers into one group, then list the new company on the New York Stock Exchange by 2014, it has said.Marchionne already runs the two automakers as a single group. But a full merger with Chrysler is seen increasing the group’s value, because the combined automaker would have more cash to invest in expensive new technology like hybrid engines.It needs these advancements to remain in the top league of the world’s automakers, alongside the likes of Volkswagen and Toyota, analysts say.	10.44470949
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co 7201.T reported its smallest quarterly profit in three years and cut its annual outlook, hurt by rising expenses in a competitive North American market and costs stemming from improper final inspection procedures at home.The automaker had suspended domestic production of vehicles for the Japanese market for about three weeks after it revealed last month that uncertified technicians had been carrying out final inspections of vehicles for decades. The scandal led to a recall of 1.2 million vehicles. [nL4N1MV1HK]“We expect to feel the impact of the improper final inspection issue in the second half,�� Hiroto Saikawa, CEO of the maker of the Leaf electric car and Rogue SUV crossover, told reporters at an earnings briefing on Wednesday.Nissan forecast an operating profit of 645 billion yen ($5.67 billion) for the year to March, almost 6 percent below a prior 685 billion yen view and down 13 percent from a year ago.While Japan’s No.2 automaker has resumed production of vehicles for the home market at all six of its domestic assembly plants as of Wednesday, the scandal has slammed the profit outlook at an affiliate that operates two of the plants.Nissan Shatai Co 7222.T slashed its annual net profit forecast by 44 percent to 5.4 billion yen, to account for a special loss of 4.5 billion yen to pay for re-inspections for the recalled cars.Nissan Motor, which has been enjoying strong sales of its e-Note compact hatchback and Serena minivan in Japan, said a back-up in orders would hurt domestic sales for October-November, but that sales would normalize by the end of December.For the second quarter, Nissan posted a 21.6 percent drop in operating profit to 128.5 billion yen, its lowest since April-June 2014 and below forecasts for an increase to 171.5 billion yen from eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Results were hurt by a multi-million U.S. settlement tied to the recall of vehicles with faulty Takata air bag inflators. Also, aggressive discounting to attract customers in the U.S. market, where demand has shifted to larger SUVs from sedans, drove up expenses and chipped away at earnings.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said U.S. May industrywide auto sales rose 8 percent to some 15.3 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate.This figure would outpace the 15.1 million annualized forecast of analysts polled through last week by Thomson Reuters.Toyota’s U.S. May sales rose 2.5 percent, which matched analysts�� expectations.	5.927617115
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T unveiled on Wednesday a new version of its plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius, almost a year after it halted production of the vehicle's previous version.The world’s largest automaker showcased the vehicle being renamed the Prius Prime at the New York International Auto Show. The Prius Prime, which goes on sale late this fall, will go 22 miles on battery power alone, twice as long as the previous version, the Japanese company said.Toyota’s move comes as automakers face a challenge selling electric vehicles amid low gasoline prices, especially in the United States, where fuel taxes are much lower than much of the world.The Prius Prime will have an estimated 120 miles or above per gallon equivalent, factoring in both the battery and gasoline powered engine, up 26 percent over the prior version because of greater battery capacity and improved hybrid system, Toyota said.And the automaker said the new version will sport a “chiseled profile and edgy character lines�� in a bid to shake up the brand’s image.Toyota said the 22 miles all-electric range is enough to meet the daily commuter distance of over half of U.S. drivers, and drivers will be able to go up to 84 mph in electric mode.That's better than the maximum 19 miles all-electric range of the Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid and the 16 miles of the Audi A3 e-tron. But it is less than other plug-in hybrids, like General Motors Co's GM.N Chevrolet Volt, which gets up to 53 miles of electric range, and 27 miles of electric range in the Hyundai Sonata plug-in hybrid.Automakers face mandates from California and other states to build a growing number of electric vehicles and other zero emission vehicles.In April 2015, Toyota said it was halting production of its plug-in for more than a year as it worked on a new version of the vehicle.The company sold just 4,200 Prius plug-in vehicles in 2015 in the United States, down 68 percent over 2014, even after it cut the price of the vehicle by $2,000.In total, Toyota sold 184,794 Prius hybrid cars in 2015 in the United States.Last year, Honda Motor Co 7267.T also said it was ending production of its Accord plug-in hybrid as it worked on a new electric vehicle. Overall U.S. plug-in hybrid sales were down 15 percent last year.	0.9593679458
TOKYO, April 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday recalled around 390,000 vehicles in Japan and overseas to tighten a fuel pressure sensor attachment to the delivery pipe to remedy an issue which may result in leakage.The recall by the Japanese automaker affected around 326,000 vehicles sold in Japan, including the Crown, the luxury sedan model made for the domestic market, and the Mark X sedan, along with the Lexus IS250. Production periods ranged from December 2003 to October 2007.A total of 64,000 Lexus IS250 and GS300 vehicles were also recalled in Europe, Oceania, Asia and other regions.Separately, Toyota recalled nearly 17,000 Crown and Crown Majesta models in Japan, produced between January 2008 and July 2013, over electrical issues with the stereo amplifier system.

TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Thursday said it was recalling a total of about 2.9 million vehicles in Japan, China, Europe and other regions including its Corolla Axio sedan and RAV4 SUV crossover due to potentially faulty airbags.The Japanese automaker said that the latest recalls were part of a wider recall of airbags which use inflators made by Takata Corp ordered by global transport authorities last year.The air bag inflators in question use a chemical compound which can explode with excessive force after prolonged exposure to hot conditions.	-1.599127749
"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - U.S. motor company Ford F.N has suspended production at one of its South African plants and Japanese car-maker Toyota 7203.T plans to follow suit as a manufacturing workers' strike hits suppliers of car components.The two-week-old strike by 220,000 NUMSA union members, who are seeking 12-15 percent annual increases, follows on the heels of a five-month strike in the platinum sector that stunted economic growth and export earnings.The strike, which has hit the supply of beverage cans made by packaging firm Nampak NPKJ.J, has damaged wider investor sentiment in Africa's most advanced economy, which is teetering on the brink of recession after a first-quarter contraction caused in part by the platinum strike. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s cut South Africa’s credit rating last month while Fitch put it on negative watch, both citing poor growth prospects mainly because of strikes.Ford spokeswoman Alicia Chetty said: “Production at our Silverton assembly plant has been temporarily suspended due to the strike.�� She said only the company’s Pretoria plant was affected and its other plant in Port Elizabeth was operating normally.Jeff Nemeth, Ford’s South Africa head, told Talk Radio 702 suspension at the plant - which assembles the Ford Ranger pick-up truck - would mean the loss of about 350 units a day.Nemeth said continued disruptions in the flow of products might affect corporate investment decisions in Africa’s most developed but ailing economy.Toyota said it would halt some production from Tuesday because of supply chain problems related to the stoppage.“Toyota will close two production lines from Tuesday at our Durban plant,�� spokeswoman Mary Willemse said.The manufacturing strike also forced General Motors GM.N to close its assembly plant in the southern city of Port Elizabeth over a week ago, despite efforts by Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant to mediate between the union and employees.“CRITICAL”Mercedes Benz DAIG.ML said supply lines to its assembly factory were reaching ""critical"" stress levels and an industry body warned more car-makers could be forced to halt production. “Things are beyond dire. We have exhausted stockpiles we managed to build up in the months leading up to this strike and I expect more companies to halt production should the strike continue,�� Ken Manners, vice president of the auto component manufacturing body NAACAM told Reuters.Production at BMW BMWG.DE, VW VOWG_p.DE and Nissan 7201.T was normal, although company officials said on Monday they were monitoring the situation closely. Those affected include construction companies Murray &amp; Roberts MURJ.J and Aveng Ltd AEGJ.J, which are working on the construction of two major power plants for state power utility Eskom.NUMSA rejected the latest pay offer from employers in the steel and engineering sector on Sunday and called on its striking members to intensify the industrial action.Employers have offered pay rises of 10 percent in the first year, 9.5 percent in the second year and 9 percent in the third year. But unions also have grievances about the role of labor brokers in industry and do not want to be bound to a multi-year agreement, preferring a one-year deal instead.NUMSA met the main employer body, Steel and Engineering Industries of South Africa (SEIFSA), on Monday to formally reject the offer.Spokesman Castro Ngobese said SEIFSA - which said on Friday it would take its latest offer off the table if it is rejected - has taken his union’s latest demand to its members for consideration.“Meanwhile the strike continues indefinitely,�� Ngobese said, adding union leaders were due to meet on Tuesday to consider ways to intensify the strike.Smaller union United Association of South Africa (UASA), which represents about 20,000 workers in the sector, said it was awaiting a reply from employers on questions about the offer.“We expect an answer by tomorrow and that will put us in a position to say if we accept or reject it but chances of accepting look good,�� Johan van Niekerk, UASA spokesman, said.Separately, about 200 workers downed tools at unlisted Cape Town-based wine maker DGB, demanding a 10 percent wage hike, union leaders said. DGB, which makes some well-known brands, is offering a 7 percent raise."	-0.8171173448

"(Reuters) - Australia’s consumer watchdog on Friday urged the owners of 20,000 vehicles with defective Takata airbags classified as particularly unsafe to stop driving immediately.In an urgent safety alert, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said a total of 425,971 vehicles are still to be fixed under a compulsory recall.Car makers like BMW BMWG.DE, Honda Motor 7267.T, Mitsubishi Motors 7211.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T have classified 20,000 of these vehicles as ""critical"" and they should not be driven, the regulator said.At least 23 deaths worldwide have been linked to the rupturing of faulty Takata air bag inflators and millions of vehicles worldwide have been recalled.Honda Australia said it has replaced 90.9% of Takata airbags in its cars, adding that remaining affected customers should act on the recall notice urgently.Toyota’s Echo and RAV4 vehicles produced between 2003 and 2005 have been classified as critical, Toyota Australia said in an emailed statement, urging customers with airbags still be replaced not to drive.BMW Australia and Mitsubishi Australia did not respond to a request for comment."	6.630253376
DETROIT (Reuters) - Scott Kluth has a love-hate relationship with his new Fisker Karma luxury electric sedan.The 34-year-old car lover bought the plug-in hybrid electric Karma in December for $107,850, but five days later the car’s battery died as he was driving in downtown Chicago. While the car he affectionately calls a “head turner�� was fixed in a recall, Kluth remains uncertain how much he will drive it.“I just want a car that works,�� Kluth said. “It’s a fun car to drive. It’s just that I’ve lost confidence in it.”The Karma’s problems -- one vehicle died during testing by Consumer Reports this month -- follow bad publicity arising from a probe of General Motors Co’s Chevrolet Volt and weak sales of the car, and the closure or bankruptcy of several electric vehicle-related start-ups.The unrelenting bad news has led to questions about the readiness of electric cars and raises fresh doubts about a technology that has been around since the late 1890s but is still struggling to win over the public.Whether electric vehicles can find an audience beyond policymakers in Washington and Hollywood celebrities depends on lowering vehicle prices without selling cars at a loss, analysts and industry executives say, while extending driving range to make the cars competitive with their gasoline-powered peers.“It’s going to be a slow slog,�� said John O’Dell, senior green car editor at industry research firm Edmunds.com. “Maybe there’s too much expectation of more and quicker success than might realistically be expected of a brand new technology.”He also questioned whether priorities will simply change for whomever is U.S. president after the November election. Electric vehicles could lose tax breaks -- currently worth $7,500 a vehicle for buyers -- particularly if a Republican ends up in the White House.Edmunds expects pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids to make up only 1.5 percent of the U.S. market in 2017, compared with 0.1 percent last year, and O’Dell said that may be optimistic. Consumers charge all-electric cars by plugging into an outlet, while hybrid versions include a gasoline engine.President Barack Obama’s administration has been a strong proponent of electric vehicles like the Volt and set a goal of getting 1 million battery-powered vehicles on the road by 2015. Lux Research estimates that number will actually be fewer than 200,000. Both the Volt and Karma’s development were supported by low-interest federal loans.That has not dissuaded automakers, many of which plan to launch electric vehicles to join the Volt and Nissan’s all-electric Leaf in a bid to meet rising fuel efficiency standards. Toyota has begun selling a plug-in Prius, and EVs from Ford, Honda, BMW and Fiat will join the fray this year, along with cars from start-ups Tesla and Coda Automotive.Electric cars aren’t a new concept. Henry Ford bought his wife, Clara, at least two electric cars in the early 1900s offering at best 50 miles driving range and top speeds of about 35 miles per hour, according to the Henry Ford Museum.But analysts said automakers have not done a good enough job getting the costs down and explaining the technology to win over anyone beyond early adopters like actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pop idol Justin Bieber, comedian Jay Leno and former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.“You can do all the advertising and promotion you want, but if people don’t buy into the message the needle’s not going to move,�� said George Cook, a marketing professor at the University of Rochester’s business school and a former Ford executive.The Volt, at almost $40,000 before federal subsidies, is seen as too expensive by many critics. Fiat-Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, a long-time EV skeptic, has said Chrysler will lose more than $10,000 on every battery-powered Fiat 500 it sells.And even with rising gasoline prices -- topping $4 a gallon in parts of the country -- EVs are just not competitive, according to the Lundberg Survey. Gasoline prices would have to rise to $8.53 a gallon to make the Leaf competitive and hit $12.50 for a Volt to be worth it, based on the cost of gasoline versus electricity, fuel efficiency and depreciation, the survey said.Obama’s vision, which he laid out at a Daimler truck plant in North Carolina this month, includes a car battery that costs half the price of today’s versions and can go up to 300 miles on a single charge. The industry is far from achieving that.Since last fall, there has been a run of bad news for EVs, starting with the late November news that U.S. safety regulators were investigating the Volt for possible battery fires.While the federal investigation was closed with the conclusion there was no defect and the car did not pose a greater risk of fire than gas-powered vehicles, weak demand led GM to halt production for five weeks and temporarily lay off 1,300 workers at the plant that builds the car. GM, which strengthened the structural protection of the Volt battery, has repeatedly said the car is safe, and some said the safety probe should have never occurred.The Karma that died during testing by Consumer Reports magazine was another blow following a recall of more than 200 of the cars last year and the halting of sales in January for a software issue. Fisker, which builds the Karma in Finland, also suspended work last month at its U.S. plant scheduled to make another car, the Nina sedan, while it works to renegotiate a $529 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy.Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher said problems can arise with new technologies and a new company but added Fisker had gone “beyond the call of duty�� in instituting a system to respond to customer issues and had plenty of satisfied owners. CEO Tom LaSorda in a letter to Karma owners last week said Fisker was committed to giving customers “complete peace of mind�� and he had created a “SWAT team�� of 50 engineers and consultants to identify issues with the car.‘FIRST LAW OF DISNEY’�The expectations have always been too high for electric cars,�� said Bill Reinert, Toyota’s U.S. manager for advanced technology. “The realities have always been clouded by the dreams. I like to say it’s the first law of thermodynamics versus the first law of Disney. Disney is wishing it will be so. It doesn’t work.�� Toyota has always been skeptical EVs would quickly boost its share of the auto market.Meanwhile, several companies have struggled due to lack of funding or customer troubles.A123 Systems posted a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss this month after Fisker, one of its largest customers, cut battery orders. Bright Automotive, an Indiana electric commercial truck start-up, closed its doors in February after failing to get a federal loan.Ener1 Inc, which received a $118.5 million federal grant to make lithium-ion batteries for EVs, filed for bankruptcy in January, and Aptera Motors, a California-based EV start-up, went out of business last December after it couldn’t raise $80 million in private funding.“There will be more companies that fail, but it’s no different than Internet companies,�� said Kristen Helsel, vice president of EV solutions for AeroVironment, which makes EV charging stations for BMW, Mitsubishi and Nissan. “People with the right business model are going to do fine.”A number of top national retail chains, including Kohl’s and Walgreen, have begun installing charging stations at their stores, but critics say the U.S. push for electric cars has come before such infrastructure is in place, weakening the case for consumers to be attracted to the technology.But since the bankruptcy of Solyndra, a solar panel maker that received $535 million in U.S. loan guarantees, federal support for advanced vehicle technology programs has ground to a halt. Industry officials and analysts point to tightened U.S. Department of Energy requirements in the face of withering criticism from Republicans about the Obama administration’s generosity for anything related to green technology.“There was certainly a different energy level one year ago, even two years ago,�� said Oliver Hazimeh, sustainable transportation practice leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. “This year, it just had a different drumbeat.�� Hazimeh sees long-term demand for EVs rising to up to 9 percent of the global market by 2022, but he predicts there will be some setbacks along the way.Obama wants to increase the tax subsidies for buyers of electric vehicles to $10,000 per vehicle from the current $7,500. But critics say the small EV sales totals tell the real story.Complicating matters, automakers continue to squeeze increased fuel efficiency out of the internal combustion engine. That makes it tougher to make EV sticker prices attractive enough to put a dent in the traditional gasoline-powered vehicles�� domination of the market.The EV’s industry’s struggles have vindicated the more deliberate approach taken by Toyota, Ford and Chrysler’s Marchionne, who killed plans for a Chrysler electric car, analysts said.Still, proponents say electric-car sales will grow just like Toyota’s hybrid Prius rose from about 5,500 in its U.S. debut in 2000 to a peak of more than 180,000 in 2007.Doug Parks, GM’s chief Volt engineer, said the proof is in the large amounts of money automakers are spending on EV technology development.“Follow the money. People are investing huge in this stuff,�� he said. “This is a 10- or 20-year discussion and we’ve been selling the Volt for a year.”GM, which recently launched a new advertising campaign centered on testimonials by adoring Volt owners, has made the car the centerpiece of efforts to seize from Toyota the mantle as the world’s greenest automaker. Meanwhile, Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has estimated pure electric vehicles like the Leaf will make up 10 percent of industry global sales by 2020.Time will tell if that’s wishful thinking.“It’s been the Kool-Aid that the entire political system has been drinking for a decade,�� said Bob Martin, a senior consultant with auto product development firm The CarLab. “Electric cars are not ready for prime time. They’re really interesting toys for very, very rich people.��	-4.073368271
BERLIN (Reuters) - German luxury-car maker Audi VOWG_p.DE stuck to its full-year profit target even as higher costs of plants and technology inflicted a double-digit drop in third-quarter earnings.The Volkswagen-owned division is pushing costly overseas expansion, adding capacity in China, Mexico and Brazil as the brand aims to topple luxury-sales champion BMW BMWG.DE by the end of the decade.Audi’s second Chinese factory will start production at the end of the year while the carmaker is spending almost 1 billion euros ($1.35 billion) on a new site in Mexico to build the next generation of the Q5 compact SUV from 2016.“We’re making high upfront expenditures and investments now and in upcoming years in order to create an even stronger global position for Audi,�� finance chief Axel Strotbek said in the quarterly earnings statement on Monday.Audi reaffirmed its goal to achieve an operating profit margin “at the upper end�� of a target range between 8 percent and 10 percent this year, even as third-quarter operating profit plunged 17 percent to 1.10 billion euros, missing the lowest estimate of 1.13 billion euros in a Reuters poll.Profit from Audi, which accounts for about 40 percent of VW group operating earnings, funds the parent's drive to surpass General Motors GM.N and Toyota 7203.T as the world's biggest carmaker by 2018.Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz &lt;DAIGn.DE &gt;, which also includes the Smart city-car brand, posted a 23 percent jump in third-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to 1.2 billion euros.However Audi’s third-quarter operating margin of 9.4 percent beat the 7.3 percent return on sales at Mercedes.BMW will report third-quarter figures on Tuesday.Audi, based in Ingolstadt, Germany, also stood by a goal to hit its sales target of 1.5 million cars and SUVs in 2013, two years early.($1 = 0.7414 euros)	-5.435881484

DETROIT, July 28 (Reuters) - An influential consumer magazine on Monday called on Toyota Motor Corp to recall about 177,500 older Camry hybrid sedans to address potential power brake defects.Consumer Reports, which many consumers use when studying what vehicles to buy, said the Japanese automaker’s decision to call for a service campaign or a warranty extension on two different problems covering cars from model years 2007 to 2011 does not go far enough. Under a service campaign, an automaker repairs cars as they are brought back to dealers by consumers.“Consumer Reports believes that Toyota should recall these cars,�� the magazine said. “What’s at issue here is a series of acknowledged defects in a crucial safety system.“A recall is more comprehensive and widely published than a mere service campaign, and owners don’t have to wait for a problem to happen before qualifying for the repair,�� Consumer Reports added. “Besides that, unlike extended warranties, recalls don’t expire and are performed proactively.”Toyota officials did not have an immediate comment.Consumer reports said Toyota’s decisions were prompted partly by consumer complaints filed with U.S. safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The complaints over the last several years have covered loss of braking performance, increased effort to press the brake pedal and other difficulties, the magazine said.NHTSA opened a “preliminary evaluation�� probe into an estimated 30,000 Camry hybrid sedans from model years 2007 and 2008 after receiving 59 complaints of intermittent loss of assisted braking, resulting in increased stopping distances.A preliminary evaluation is the first step in a process that can lead to a recall if regulators determine that a manufacturer needs to address a safety problem.Consumer Reports, which pointed out that Toyota’s service campaign and extended warranty both broadened the scope of the potentially affected vehicles, said its review for the two model years NHTSA cited found power-brake complaints had risen to 269, with 14 crashes and five injuries.In the service campaign, a problem is potentially caused by a clogged brake-fluid reservoir filter and “front-brake assist could be temporarily lost,�� according to a Toyota notice to its dealers. Instead of a recall, Toyota will alert owners to the campaign to install a new brake reservoir tank at no cost between now and June 30, 2017.In the other case, Toyota is extending warranty coverage of the anti-lock brake system’s brake actuator from the standard three years or 36,000 miles, to 10 years or 150,000 miles, according to a separate company notice to dealers. Remedies could include a new actuator or the reprogramming of the skid control electronic control unit. (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit. Editing by Andre Grenon)	-5.100348316

NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Motors Co has agreed to pay $900 million and sign a deferred-prosecution agreement to end a U.S. government investigation into its handling of an ignition-switch defect linked to 124 deaths, two sources told Reuters.The deal means GM will be charged criminally with hiding the defect from regulators and in the process defrauding consumers, but the case will be put on hold while GM fulfills terms of the deal, one source said.No individuals would be charged in the criminal case, one of the sources said.The company’s expected $900 million payment, confirmed by a second source, is less than the $1.2 billion that Toyota Motor Corp paid to resolve a similar case.GM declined to comment. Spokeswomen for U.S. prosecutors in New York and in Washington also declined to comment.The terms of GM’s deal with the government were not immediately known, including how many counts the automaker would be charged with, whether the automaker agreed to hire an independent monitor, or how long it would need to abide by the agreement before the case may be dropped.The agreement was expected to be announced on Thursday, the sources said. Any deferred-prosecution agreement would require court approval.“I am very hopeful the Department of Justice will hold GM fully accountable and presses for an acknowledgement of responsibility as well as monetary penalties,�� Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said in a telephone interview with Reuters.Shares of GM were up 31 cents, or 1 percent, to $31.51 in after-hours trading.GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, took charges totaling $4.2 billion in 2014 to reflect costs associated with recalls, and a special fund was established to compensate victims of the ignition switch defect. It was not immediately clear whether GM would take additional charges to account for a settlement of the criminal probe.The settlement is a milestone in a case that over the past two years drove a transformation in the once cozy relationship between the auto industry and regulators in the U.S. government.Outrage over the GM ignition switch case prompted a much tougher approach by Washington toward auto safety issues and compelled automakers to act more quickly and comprehensively to recall vehicles with potentially dangerous defects.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra in 2014 undertook a series of actions to atone for the ignition switch failure, including appointing a new safety czar, overhauling GM’s product engineering organization, and pushing out 15 executives connected to the mishandling of the switch defects in a scathing report prepared by former federal prosecutor Anton Valukas, now a senior partner at the law firm Jenner &amp; Block.GM also recalled more than 30 million vehicles in North America in 2014 to fix a wide array of defects.GM’s approach contrasted with Toyota, which was slower to cooperate with regulators in response to defects related to incidents of sudden acceleration.Toyota in March 2014 agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a charge that it concealed a problem in its vehicles that caused them to accelerate suddenly. That penalty remains the largest ever levied by the United States on an auto company.Federal prosecutors based in New York have been investigating GM since at least March 2014 over the company’s disclosures to regulators about vehicles equipped with the faulty ignition switches.The ignition switches on Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other GM vehicles could cause their engines to stall, which in turn prevented air bags from deploying during crashes. Also, power steering and power brakes did not operate when the ignition switch unexpectedly moved from the “on�� position.Engineers and managers at Detroit-based GM learned of problems with the ignition switch more than a decade ago, but the first recalls began only in February 2014, despite years of consumer complaints.GM agreed with the U.S. Transportation Department in May 2014 to pay a $35 million fine over its delayed response to the defect. Separate from the action by the Justice Department, the fine was the maximum the Transportation Department could impose.Sources told Reuters in 2014 that the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan was interviewing present and former GM employees as part of a criminal probe, and prosecutors were working on a set of mail and wire fraud charges similar to the criminal case that Toyota settled.GM’s Barra said in June that the automaker was cooperating fully with prosecutors and that any settlement would be on their timeline.The automaker said in securities filing in July that it was facing related investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 50 state attorneys general and the Canadian government.GM is facing more than 200 civil lawsuits over the ignition switch and other safety recalls from 2014, although the judge who oversaw GM’s 2009 bankruptcy has ruled that claims related to the company’s pre-bankruptcy conduct were barred.Plaintiffs are seeking damages for deaths and injuries blamed on vehicle defects, as well as economic losses such as lost vehicle value. The first of the civil cases is slated for trial in January 2016.GM funneled many of the injury and death claims linked to the ignition switch into an out-of-court settlement program run by Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, who also oversaw compensation programs for victims of high-profile incidents such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.The program received more than 4,300 claims and has found nearly 400 of those eligible for compensation, according to an August report from the program.

YOKOHAMA, Japan, July 26 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Corp posted a 19.7 p ercent drop i n quarterly operating profit on Thursday as the impact of a strong yen and the costs of launching its new Altima sedan outweighed so l id global vehicle sales.Japan’s No.2 automaker, after Toyota Motor Corp, reported operating profit of 120.7 billion yen ($1.5 billion) for the April-June period compared with 150.4 billion yen a year ago and lower than the average estimate of 142.5 billion yen from six analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net profit was 72.3 billion yen, down 15 percent from the 85 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.Nissan, which is 43 percent-owned by Renault SA, is expected to underperform domestic rivals Toyota and Honda Motor Co as its latest figures will be compared with strong year-earlier results.Nissan bounced back more quickly than its domestic rivals from the supply disruptions that followed Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.The automaker, under CEO Carlos Ghosn, has pushed into fast-growing markets like China and Russia, which has helped drive higher sales.Nissan sold 1.2 million vehicles globally in the three months to June, up 15.9 percent from the same period in the previous year. It said in May that it aimed to sell 5.4 million cars in the year to March 2013.

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Thursday said its board of directors will consider a proposal about further partnership with rival Mazda Motor Corp, after a report the Japanese automakers plan to build a factory together in the United States.Japan’s Nikkei reported on Thursday that Toyota would take a roughly 5 percent stake in Mazda Motor Corp to establish a U.S. auto plant and develop key electric vehicle technologies.The deal could be announced as soon as Friday, the newspaper said. (s.nikkei.com/2wpAbhk)Toyota, in a statement, said the two companies have been exploring various areas of collaboration under a May 2015 agreement.“We intend to submit a proposal to our board of directors today regarding the partnership with Mazda, however, we would like to refrain from providing further comment at this time,�� Toyota said in a statement issued by its U.S. operations.Toyota, the world’s second largest automaker by vehicle sales in 2016 and Japan’s dominant car company, has been forging alliances with smaller Japanese rivals for several years, effectively consolidating the Japanese auto sector.If Toyota and Mazda agree to build an assembly plant in the United States, it would likely become the prize in a fierce competition among Midwestern and Southern states eager to expand manufacturing jobs.President Donald Trump in January criticized Toyota for importing cars to the United States from Mexico, and has made it a top priority to increase the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to build 2,000 new ventilators for coronavirus patients that even the government says hospitals are unlikely to need.Instead, the plan, announced in April, appears to be more about bringing home manufacturing of equipment seen as key to the country’s national security, a long-held focus for the Japanese premier that has deepened with the coronavirus crisis.Abe wants Japanese companies to build 2,000 ventilators to add to an unused stock of 4,700 already in hospitals. A further 8,300 are deployed in critical care units, of which only a fraction are used to keep COVID-19 patients alive.But even the health ministry acknowledges that hospitals, which now buy almost all their ventilators overseas, likely have enough, while industry experts say Japan’s small ventilator-makers will struggle to produce more than the few dozen a month they usually build.“It is probably more than Japan needs now,�� said Akihisa Maeda, an official at the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour who is responsible for medical device policy, about the number of ventilators. “It is true there aren’t enough qualified people to operate them.”Abe’s plan shows how the coronavirus crisis is spurring political concern about the potential vulnerability of overseas supply lines. Japan is also offering firms money to shift production of face masks and other products from China.Japan needs to cut dependence on imports from the United States, Europe and China, said the health ministry’s Maeda.“It’s a matter of national security. The coronavirus outbreak has shown that.”Ventilators are used to inflate the fluid-filled lungs of critically ill COVID-19 patients through a tube inserted into the windpipe, and require constant monitoring.Yet so far, only around 5% of seriously ill COVID-19 patients in Japan need the procedure known as intubation, a panel of experts has said. In early May there were 4,500 hospitalised cases, meaning roughly 270 were on ventilators. In Japan just under 800 people have died.“It’s like building fighter jets without having pilots,�� a leading intensive care specialist said about the government’s plan. Every new ventilator needs health professionals who are in short supply, he said, asking not to be identified.The Japan Society of Respiratory Care also said there are enough ventilators, barring a major coronavirus surge.Ventilator makers require technicians to ramp up production, but even with additional manpower, they still need to find components overseas amid strong international demand.“My first thought was, it’s going to be tough to get the parts,�� said Akikazu Endo, sales and marketing manager at ventilator maker Sanko Manufacturing, about the government’s plan.At its small plant next to a vegetable field an hour by train from Tokyo, Sanko is making coronavirus ventilators with parts from human anaesthesia machines and ventilators designed for cats and dogs.It usually hand builds around 30 ventilators a year, and initially proposed to build 300. It later scaled that back to 50.Sanko buys electronic boards from China and will have to wait as long as six months for more, Endo said. Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry officials, who visited Sanko, connected it with a Japanese company that can build the same part, but conducting tests will take time and money, he said.“We can’t be in a situation where we run out of ventilators,�� a METI official told Reuters.Nihon Kohden, which builds 30 ventilators a month, is aiming to manufacture 1,000 within six months. It is still in talks to secure parts, a spokeswoman said.‘RISKY MARKET’Given the parts shortage, Abe has asked Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Sony Corp and others to help.Unlike U.S. President Donald Trump, who has invoked Korean War-era laws to compel manufacturers to build some 200,000 ventilators, Abe’s more modest 2,000-target faces hurdles because he can’t force Japanese companies to cooperate.“Companies tend to see ventilators and other invasive medical devices as too much of a gamble,�� an official at the Japan Association of Medical Devices Industries said.Speaking as head of the Japan auto industry lobby, Toyota president Akio Toyoda said automakers wanted to take a back seat by providing manufacturing know-how, saying it was “not easy�� to make products that so directly affect human life.An auto executive told Reuters the industry had other concerns.“We are willing to cooperate, but it’s a small and risky market,�� the executive said, asking not to be identified.A Sony spokesman said it won’t be responsible for ventilator design or development. Nissan said nothing had been decided.The health ministry’s Maeda said there’s no deadline for Japan Inc to deliver.“Our aim is to achieve a balance between imports and those made locally.��	8.630775752
15. Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen aus der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus:FIAT CHRYSLER - Mailand: Der Autobauer bemüht sich angesichts der Coronakrise einem Insider zufolge um eine milliardenschwere Staatsbürgschaft. Das Unternehmen spreche mit der italienischen Großbank Intesa Sanpaolo über einen vom Staat garantierten Kredit im Volumen von 6,3 Milliarden Euro, sagte eine mit dem Vorgang vertraute Person Reuters. Fiat Chrysler und die Bank lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab.VF CORP - Bangalore: Der US-Hersteller von Vans-Schuhen und Timberland-Stiefeln rechnet wegen der durch das Coronavirus verursachten Ladenschließungen im laufenden Quartal mit Umsatzeinbußen von mehr als der Hälfte. “In den ersten zehn Monaten des Fiskaljahres 2019/2020 hat unser Unternehmen Ergebnisse erzielt, die über unseren langfristigen Wachstumszielen liegen. Dann veränderte sich die Welt für uns alle wegen COVID-19��, sagte VF-Corp-Chef Steve Rendle. Davon seien auch die Lieferanten betroffen, ferner würden viele Werke mit reduzierter Kapazität arbeiten. Für das im März beendete vierte Quartal des Geschäftsjahres 2019/20 meldete das in Denver, Colorado, ansässige Unternehmen einen Nettoverlust von 483,8 Millionen Dollar, verglichen mit einem Gewinn von 128,8 Millionen Dollar im Vorjahreszeitraum. Der Nettoumsatz sank um etwa zwei Prozent auf 2,1 Milliarden Dollar und lag damit unter den Analysten-Schätzung von 2,28 Milliarden Dollar. VF-Corp gab keinen Ausblick auf das aktuelle Geschäftsjahr 2020/2021.TOYOTA - Tokio: Der japanische Autobauer plant wegen der Coronavirus-Krise seine heimische Produktion im Juni zu reduzieren. Wegen der geringeren Nachfrage nach Neuwagen werde der Konzern nun 122.000 Einheiten weniger herstellen, teilte Toyota mit. Dies entspreche einer 40-prozentigen Kürzung gegenüber den bisherigen Prognosen für den Monat Juni.BMW - München: Der Autobauer beginnt mit der angekündigten Herstellung von Atemschutzmasken in Deutschland. Zwei vollautomatische Anlagen produzieren im Werk Wackersdorf bei Regensburg täglich insgesamt bis zu 200.000 Mund-Nase-Masken, mit denen sich BMW-Mitarbeiter vor dem Coronavirus schützen sollen. Spezialmaschinen und Rohmaterial stammen ebenfalls aus Bayern. Die Maschinen lieferte der zum chinesischen Autozulieferer Ningbo Joyson Electronic gehörende deutsche Hersteller PIA Automation. Vliesstoffe kommen vom bayerischen Textilkonzern Sandler. Die Bundesregierung will die heimische Produktion von Masken und weiterer medizinischer Ausrüstung ankurbeln.OTTOBOCK �� Danzig: Das Medizintechnikunternehmen hat im vergangenen Jahr erstmals einen Jahresumsatz von mehr als einer Milliarde Euro erzielt. Der Umsatz kletterte 2019 um 8,2 Prozent auf 1,003 Milliarden Euro, wie Ottobock mitteilte. Der bereinigte operative Gewinn (Ebitda) stieg um zehn Prozent auf 191 Millionen Euro. Damit verbesserte sich die Ebitda-Marge auf 19,2 Prozent. “Im nächsten Schritt wollen wir ein Niveau von 20 Prozent erreichen��, sagte Finanzchef Jörg Wahlers. Für 2020 habe Ottobock das Wachstumstempo eigentlich steigern wollen, doch die Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise auf die Geschäftszahlen seien noch nicht abschätzbar, sagte Firmenchef Philipp Schulte-Noelle. “In den ersten Monaten waren wir voll auf Kurs, diese Ziele zu erreichen.�� Sobald sich die Situation normalisiert habe, rechne das Unternehmen mit Nachholeffekten.FOXCONN - Taipeh: Der Gewinn des taiwanischen Elektronikherstellers ist im ersten Quartal um fast 90 Prozent eingebrochen. Der Nettogewinn von Foxconn - früher Hon Hai Precision - rutschte auf 2,1 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar (rund 65 Millionen Euro), da die Corona-Pandemie die Nachfrage von Apple und anderen Großkunden drückte, wie Foxconn mitteilte. Dies liegt deutlich unter den Analystenschätzungen von 8,88 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar. Der Konzern erwartet jedoch ein zweistelliges Umsatzwachstum im zweiten Quartal, da die Produktion in China wieder hochgefahren ist. “Hon Hai wird sich im zweiten Quartal stabilisieren��, erklärte der Konzern.FORTUM/UNIPER - Helsinki: Der finnische Energieversorger Fortum hat im ersten Quartal weniger verdient. Der operative Gewinn schrumpfte um vier Prozent auf 393 Millionen Euro, lag damit aber noch über den Erwartungen der Analysten. Der Mehrheitseigentümer des Düsseldorfer Versorgers Uniper konnte Einbußen durch niedrigere Strompreise weitgehend durch Absicherungsgeschäfte ausgleichen. Fortum bekräftigte, im Laufe des Jahres mit Uniper eine gemeinsame Strategie zu entwickeln.WÜSTENROT &amp; WÜRTTEMBERGISCHE (W&amp;W) - München: Der Gewinn des Bauspar- und Versicherungskonzerns ist wegen des Abschwungs an den Kapitalmärkten in der Coronakrise im ersten Quartal um zwei Drittel eingebrochen. Das Nettoergebnis sei auf 25,0 (78,5) Millionen Euro gesunken, teilte W&amp;W mit. Grund dafür war ein negatives Finanzergebnis. Die Pandemie zeigte sich vor allem bei der Bausparkasse Wüstenrot, deren Brutto-Neugeschäft um 13 Prozent einbrach. Damit habe sie aber noch Marktanteile gewonnen, erklärte W&amp;W. Die Gewinnprognose für 2020 hatte der Konzern bereits Anfang Mai gekappt.CATHAY PACIFIC - Sydney: Die Fluggesellschaft bezeichnet ihre Aussichten wegen der Coronavirus-Pandemie als “sehr düster��. Die Passagierzahlen von Cathay Pacific brachen im April um 99,6 Prozent ein. “Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt sehen wir noch keine unmittelbaren Anzeichen für eine Verbesserung��, sagte Ronald Lam, Manager bei Cathay Pacific. Das Hongkonger Unternehmen verbuchte im Zeitraum Januar bis April einen ungeprüften Verlust von 4,5 Milliarden Hongkong-Dollar (537,1 Millionen Euro).GEA - Düsseldorf: Der für die Nahrungsmittel- und Getränkeindustrie produzierende Anlagenbauer hat bislang keine größeren Auswirkungen der Coronakrise zu spüren bekommen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California and 22 other U.S. states filed suit on Friday to challenge the Trump administration’s decision to revoke California’s authority to set stiff vehicle tailpipe emissions rules and require a rising number of zero emission vehicles (ZEV).The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seeks to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision in September to revoke portions of a waiver it granted in 2013.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is leading the legal challenges, told Reuters in an interview this week the state would aggressively fight to protect its own legal authority.“We are going to fight for everything we’ve gotten, everything we’ve attained and everything we still need to do,�� Becerra said. “The Trump administration continues to fight on the side of for-profit polluters, instead of tackling air pollution and protecting public health.”The move follows a separate lawsuit filed in September by 23 states led by California against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) seeking to undo a parallel determination that federal law bars California from setting tailpipe emission standards and ZEV rules.The California ZEV mandate, adopted in 1990 and revised on numerous occasions, requires the sale of a rising number of electric or other zero-emission vehicles. Last year, California forecast that about 8% of the state’s new vehicle sales in 2025 will be zero-emission and plug-in electric hybrids.The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit Friday but said the agency had not revoked California’s separate authority to enforce its Low Emission Vehicle program and other standards to address harmful smog-forming vehicle emissions.Over the past 50 years, the EPA has granted more than 100 waivers for California emissions standards. California’s vehicle emissions rules are followed by about a dozen other U.S. states.Last month, major automakers - including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - backed the Trump administration’s effort to bar California from setting tailpipe standards.Those automakers intervened on Trump’s behalf in the lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Washington by states and environmental groups over NHTSA’s determination.California and other states are separately filing a protective petition on Friday with the appeals court over the NHTSA determination. The Trump administration has asked that the district court suits be dismissed and the challenges moved to the appeals court.The lawsuit marks the latest salvo in a high-stakes battle between the Trump administration and state officials over the future of U.S. vehicles.The U.S. Justice Department in August launched an antitrust investigation into four major automakers that struck a deal with California to follow revised state vehicle emissions standards. Reuters reported the administration issued civil subpoenas to Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.In August 2018, the administration proposed freezing vehicle efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, which would result in average fuel efficiency of 37 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 46.7 mpg under Obama-era rules.The Trump administration’s final requirements are expected to be released in the coming months and modestly boost fuel efficiency versus the initial proposal, with several automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, much less stringent than the Obama rules.The lawsuit was filed by the 23 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia and the cities of New York and Los Angeles.In addition to California, the other states are: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.	-0.7451253482
WARSAW (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp will invest 400 million zlotys ($113 million) in manufacturing a new combustion engine for hybrid vehicles in Poland, the company and Polish authorities said on Tuesday.Toyota will start production of the new-generation 1.5 liter engine from 2020 in its factory in the south-western city of Jelcz-Laskowice. The engine will be used in so-called hybrid vehicles, which also have an electric engine installed.“Hybrid drives currently account for 40 percent of Toyota’s European sales and their share is growing rapidly,�� Eiji Takeichi, head of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Poland, was quoted as saying in a statement from the Polish economy ministry.“This investment means that we will be able to meet market demand,�� he said.Toyota said in September it had established a new venture to develop fully electric vehicle technology with partner Mazda Motor, seeking to catch up with rivals in an increasingly frenetic race to produce more battery-powered cars.Both automakers are somewhat behind their peers, with neither having a fully electric passenger car on the market. This contrasts with Tesla, which unveiled in November an electric heavy duty truck as well as a new roadster.Toyota currently has two manufacturing plants in Poland’s Lower Silesia region. The combustion engine factory in Jelcz-Laskowice employs nearly 500 people while another plant in the city of Walbrzych, which also produces transmissions, employs 1,500 people.($1 = 3.5359 zlotys)	1.606775368

(Reuters) - Spanish veteran Carlos Sainz won the Dakar Rally in Argentina on Saturday as Peugeot bowed out with their third win in a row.The victory, ahead of Qatar’s two times winner Nasser al-Attiyah in a Toyota, handed Sainz his second title in the grueling endurance race that switched to South America from Africa in 2009 for security reasons.The double world rally champion previously won in 2010 with Volkswagen.Peugeot’s works team, who won the previous two Dakars with Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel, had already announced their departure after this year’s edition.Austrian Matthias Walkner, last year’s runner-up to British team mate Sam Sunderland, won the motorcycle category for his first Dakar triumph and KTM’s 17th in a row.Sainz had led the cars into the final stage with a 46 minute advantage over al-Attiyah and he took no risks after a marathon two weeks from Peru through Bolivia that have seen a spate of retirements and accidents.He was immediately applauded by his son and namesake, the Renault Formula One driver.“Today I am probably the proudest son of his father in the whole world. Winner of the toughest @dakar ever done in South America at 55 years of age (good number) and he did it in his own way,�� said the driver, who races with the number 55.Sainz finished ninth on the last stage, beating al-Attiyah by 43 minutes.The third place on the podium went to South African Giniel de Villiers in a Toyota, ahead of Peterhansel.“We managed to do it,�� said Sainz. “They (Peugeot) have already won two times, but I think I deserved this victory because we have put lot of effort into this car.“I had ups and downs, but I always tried my best. Especially this rally, it has been so, so hard,�� added the Spaniard, who left open the question of whether he would be back next year without Peugeot.“At the beginning I said we’ll take it a little bit easier, but Peugeot said we’d have to go flat out. I raced a couple of days and pushed really hard, but then the race was a case of not making mistakes.”Russian Eduard Nikolaev won the truck category in a Kamaz for the second year in a row and third time in total. Chilean Ignacio Casale won the quadbike title for the second time.	-2.546628407

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Li Chunrong was hired by Chinese automaker Geely to revive the fortunes of the Proton brand in Malaysia, and it took him two years to eclipse Japanese giants Honda and Toyota. Now he plans to take the fight across Southeast Asia and beyond.Li, appointed Proton CEO in 2017 when Geely acquired 49.9% of the company, has turned around a once-celebrated Malaysian marque that had to rely on state aid after a string of losses, with his success built on an aggressive cost-cutting drive.Now Geely has told the Proton boss to expand across the region, initially focusing on Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei, Li told Reuters - the first time concrete details of the brand’s expansion plans have been disclosed.Like Malaysia, they are right-hand drive markets so require fewer car modifications. Proton also aims to drive into the Middle East and increase sales to Egypt, said the 56-year-old Chinese national.Li did not give specific timeframes for expansion into individual markets, but said Proton wanted to raise overseas sales - which stood at about 1,000 cars last year, or 1% of total sales - at least four-fold this year.The carmaker wants 40% of its sales to come from foreign markets by 2027, he told Reuters in two interviews, identifying Thailand and Indonesia as the key markets but declining to outline his strategy to crack them.“We have a good foundation,�� he said. “We commit that, every year, we will launch a new model.”The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region of over 500 million people is promising territory; car sales are forecast by consultancy IHS Markit to grow at a compound annual rate of 3% in 2016-2020, compared with a 1% drop globally.But IHS said Proton was still a small player compared with the Japanese brands, and that it could struggle to compete.ASEAN sales are led by Toyota with a 30% market share, Honda with 13% and Mitsubishi 7211.T with 10%, according to the consultancy. Proton is in 11th place with about 3%, mainly from Malaysia.Proton’s goals are ambitious and it may not have the production capacity to make inroads regionally, said Mayuree Chaiyuthanaporn, a senior IHS analyst.“In terms of sales, Proton may not be successful outside Malaysia,�� she added.Geely said Proton had performed well in the past two years and it was committed to seeing the Malaysian company be a leading brand in Southeast Asia.Proton, majority-owned by Malaysian conglomerate DRB-HICOM DRBM.KL, has launched products at a breakneck speed in its home market. It dropped many old models the first year of the joint venture, and then launched six new ones within eight months, including the X70 SUV based on Geely's Boyue. It became the second-largest car seller with a 16.7% share last year - when it made its first profit in about nine years - climbing above Honda and Toyota from fourth position.Li said Proton could beat Malaysia's top seller Perodua, backed by Japan's Daihatsu 6023.T, by 2022 - five years ahead of the target announced after Geely's investment. Proton outlined to Reuters some of the cost-cutting measures that have bolstered its Malaysian fortunes - and that could be key for success in its expansion drive. Some of the rapid changes have, however, jarred local sensitivities, a problem that it could also encounter in other countries.The carmaker has increasingly switched to sourcing cheaper components from China, and let go of many small local distributors, stoking some resentment. It has also been trying to get more Malaysian vendors to partner with Chinese suppliers, in a bid to get them to cut costs by 30%.Proton, which saved 250 million ringgit ($61.5 million) in costs in 2018, has also cut its warehouses to four from 16 and sold 1,000 of its 1,500 company cars. Its drive has even extended to stopping newspaper subscriptions for all executives apart from Li’s deputy.The automaker has also faced accusations from politicians and industry groups of favoring Chinese or ethnic Chinese-Malaysian dealers.All the 47 dealers who left the brand since Geely’s entry are Malays, and the number of Malay dealers has fallen to 32% from 42% before the Chinese investment, the trade and industry minister told parliament last month.Many left as they were unable meet Proton’s demand of investing around $1 million to upgrade their sales-only centers to offer aftermarket services, said the Malaysian Association of Malay Vehicle Importers and Traders.“It was a culture shock,�� said Nik Izani Nik Ibrahim, deputy president of the association, adding that most dealers were losing money before Geely’s entry.Li denied that there had been any discrimination, saying decisions were driven by business logic.He said nearly a dozen Malaysian ministers had raised the concerns of Malay dealers in his first year but that those worries had eased now.The automaker has since changed its strategy for dealership, allowing some basic sales-only centers to continue, dealers and company officials said.Proton, launched in 1983, was Malaysia’s market leader in its early years. Its market share plunged in the last decade, however, as customers shunned its lower-standard cars and limited after-sales service, Proton officials have said.The turnaround under Li has forced Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a car aficionado, to reverse his initial opposition to Geely’s investment in Proton.“Now, it’s selling 100,000 cars and it’s making profit,�� Mahathir, whose fleet of cars now includes a red X70, told reporters this month.“Why? Because of management, because of good technology.��($1 = 4.0650 ringgit)	-7.629812787
"DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. consumer demand for new vehicles began to thaw in March, especially for luxury cars and big trucks, but not every carmaker participated in the uptick.New-vehicle sales rose 0.6 percent from a year ago, to 1,545,802 vehicles, industry consultant Autodata Corp said. Automakers had one fewer day and one fewer weekend in which to sell than during the year-ago month.Among the strong performers were Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS and Audi VOWG_p.DE.While dealership traffic began to pick up last month, ""the second quarter looks to be even more favorable"" because of pent-up demand after a harsh winter, according to Eric Lyman, vice president of industry insights for research firm TrueCar Inc TRUE.O.The annualized sales rate rebounded sharply in March, to 17.15 million vehicles, from 16.2 million in February.Last month’s sales were driven in part by German and Japanese luxury brands, as well as by a strong appetite for big trucks and SUVs from Detroit manufacturers.Results varied by company, with only three of the top six automakers beating analysts�� expectations and only two exceeding their year-earlier sales.Only Toyota managed to do both. Its sales rose 4.9 percent, to 225,959 vehicles. Analysts had expected 223,280.March was a strong month, said Bob Carter, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota’s U.S. sales arm. Demand for trucks and SUVs is driving the market, he said. “Every one of our light trucks ... is supply-restricted.”Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MIFCAU.N said sales were up 1.7 percent, to 197,261, in line with expectations.Ford Motor Co F.N and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T beat expectations, but their sales fell from a year ago. Ford was down 3.4 percent, to 235,929, while Nissan dropped 2.7 percent to 145,085.General Motors Co GM.N and Honda Motor Co 7267.T missed expectations, as sales dipped at both companies. GM was down 2.4 percent, to 249,875, and Honda fell 5.3 percent to 126,293.Domestic luxury vehicle sales were soft in March, with the notable exception of the full-size Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicles.Most foreign luxury brands saw year-to-year gains of 1 to 20 percent in March.Ford and Chevrolet amped up the stakes in full-size pickups, with dealers offering discounts of up to $9,000 on 2015 models and $12,000 or more on leftover 2014 models.Despite the hefty price rollbacks, sales of Ford’s best-selling F-Series pickup dropped nearly 5 percent in March. At GM, Chevrolet Silverado sales were up 7 percent.Analysts said rising consumer sentiment in March was reflected in higher vehicle transaction prices. TrueCar estimated the average price of a new vehicle in March rose to $32,201, up 2.1 percent from a year earlier.(This version of the story corrects Toyota’s sales increase to 4.9 percent, not 2.9 percent, in paragraph 8.

Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. plug-in electric cars started 2013 slowly, as sales of the Chevrolet Volt, the Toyota Prius Plug-In and Nissan Leaf each had deep dropoffs in January from December.Volt sales fell 57 percent in January from December, Leaf sales fell 56 percent and Prius Plug-In sales were down 36 percent. Industrywide, U.S. auto sales fell 23 percent from December, and rose 14.2 percent from last January.Even after accounting for the fact that January is one of the slowest months of the year for auto sales, the dropoff for plug-in electric cars was considerable, said Michelle Krebs, analyst with Edmunds.com.Krebs said U.S. consumers who want an alternative to fully gasoline-powered cars are opting for less-expensive standard hybrids, rather than plug-in electric cars. The automakers themselves cited other factors such as limited inventories and production that has yet to gear up fully.The Volt and the Prius Plug-In are both gasoline-electric plug-in hybrids while the Leaf runs fully on electric power.Automakers reported increased U.S. and Canadian January sales on Friday.Toyota and Nissan officials each said sales for their plug-in electric vehicles were down because of model year changeovers that cut the number of available cars on dealer lots.Also, said Nissan brand North American sales chief Al Castignetti, production of the Leaf cars for the U.S. market was down because production at a plant in Tennessee which began recently is not yet at full capacity. Production of the Leaf recently switched from a plant in Japan.General Motors Co officials said January sales were down for the Chevy Volt due to a spike in December sales related to buyers who bought before the end of the year to gain 2012 tax benefits.Limited inventory in January makes sense, said Jesse Toprak, analyst with TrueCar.com, who agreed dealer inventory was slight in January.“I anticipate the sales of the three vehicles to grow by at least 8 percent in 2013,�� said Toprak.U.S. January sales of the Volt were 1,140, down from 2,633 in December. Its 2012 sales were 23,461, up from 7,671 in 2011.For Toyota Motor Corp’s Prius Plug-In, January U.S. sales were 874, down from 1,361 in December. Its 2012 sales were 13,200, the year it was introduced.But sales for the Prius Plug-In will slide this year, to about 12,000, said Bill Fay, head of U.S. sales for the Toyota brand.Fay said he is “very positive�� but has moderate expectations for the Prius Plug-In sales.Nissan Motor Co’s Leaf saw sales drop in January to 650. After production ramps up to full capacity in Tennessee, Leaf sales will be about 1,500 a month, said Castignetti.	4.712255954
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s auto industry demanded tax cuts and easier access to finance for dealers and buyers at a meeting with Indian government officials on Wednesday to discuss the sector’s woes, sources said, in an effort to revive sales that have slumped.Executives from across the sector also asked the government to provide incentives to scrap old vehicles, which they said would help boost sales, and urged officials to reconsider a proposal to hike registration fees for automobiles as it would hurt demand, the two sources said.Arvind Sawant, minister for heavy industries, who attended the meeting, told reporters that the government had heard the industry’s concerns but needed more meetings before making any decisions.“We have not given any immediate solution. We have listened to them,�� he said, adding that officials would come up with a solution soon.The meeting, chaired by India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, was attended by senior executives from automakers including Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS, Hyundai Motor 005380.KS, Toyota Motor 7203.T, Skoda [VOWGK.UL], Mahindra &amp; Mahindra MAHM.NS, Tata Motors TAMO.NS and Hero MotoCorp HROM.NS and auto parts makers Minda Industries MNDA.NS and India Pistons.Representatives from the auto, auto components and dealers trade bodies as well as officials from the ministries of finance, heavy industries and road transport were also present.“HUGE DANGER”The auto sector, which contributes more than 7% of India’s GDP, is facing one of its worst downturns. Passenger vehicle sales have dropped for nine straight months through July, with some automakers suffering year-on-year declines of more than 30% in recent months.“Currently we are going through one of the biggest slowdowns that we have seen in recent times,�� Pawan Goenka, managing director at automaker Mahindra said earlier on Wednesday after the company reported a quarterly profit.Goenka, who said this is the worst Indian autos market since 2001, warned of a “huge danger�� of job losses and sought government intervention.Motorbike maker Yamaha Motor 7272.T and auto components makers including France's Valeo VLOF.PA and Subros SUBR.NS have laid off about 1,700 temporary workers in India, Reuters reported on Tuesday.The auto executives urged the government to cut taxes on cars and auto components to 18% from 28% and sought help to prod banks to lower lending rates and make the loan terms more lenient, one of the sources said.While several factors have contributed to the slump, a deepening liquidity crunch among India’s shadow banks that lend to the companies, dealers and car buyers has been the biggest single factor hurting sales.On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its benchmark interest rate for a fourth straight time, slicing 35 basis points off the repo rate to bring it down to 5.40%.For the auto industry, though, the concern is that the banks and shadow lenders will not cut their lending rates by as much as the RBI because the lenders are overburdened by bad debts or finding it difficult to borrow.The executives also asked the government to go slow on its electric vehicles plan. They said that while the industry would like to switch to clean fuel technology the aggressive push was delaying purchases by buyers who fear gasoline vehicles could be banned, the sources said.	2.690374952
SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is likely to close its production in Australia, after General Motors Co said it would end vehicle and engine manufacturing in the country by the end of 2017, an Australian labour union official said on Wednesday.The world’s second-largest auto maker said it was closing its Holden plants in South Australia and Victoria states, affecting 2,900 jobs, which would leave Toyota as the only auto maker in the country.GM’s exit would make it “highly likely�� that Toyota would also end its production in Australia, the Australian Manufacturing Workers�� Union official told reporters.	0.3905600798

(The Sports Xchange) - The frantic, final moments nearly undermined all the Houston Rockets built in scratching out a double-digit lead, but James Harden took advantage of the disarray by doing what he does best.Harden nailed a step-back jumper with 2.7 seconds left, and the Houston Rockets claimed a 97-96 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game Three of a Western Conference first-round playoff series at Toyota Center on Thursday.The defending champion Warriors, playing a second consecutive game without All-Star guard Stephen Curry (right ankle sprain), still lead the best-of-seven series 2-1 with Game Four set for Sunday at Toyota Center.The Rockets blew a 17-point lead and trailed with 10.6 seconds left after Trevor Ariza threw away an inbounds pass that facilitated a fastbreak layup by Warriors reserve guard Ian Clark.With Houston out of timeouts, Harden followed with a quick dribble, darted into the lane and spun free before nailing a 10-foot jumper.Warriors forward Draymond Green dribbled the ensuing inbounds pass off his foot and out of bounds for a turnover with one second left.“A lot of people just get nervous and don’t want to be in that situation,�� said Harden, who scored a game-high 35 points.“For me, I strive in moments like that, so you just have to have confidence.”Harden added eight rebounds and nine assists. Donatas Motiejunas produced 14 points and 13 rebounds, while Dwight Howard also recorded a double-double (13 points and 13 rebounds) plus two blocks.Reserve forward Marreese Speights led Golden State with 22 points in 18 minutes. Klay Thompson contributed 17 points and eight rebounds, and Shaun Livingston, who again filled in for Curry, added 16 points.What Speights started in the second quarter and carried through the third, Livingston picked up in the fourth.Following a pair of Harrison Barnes free throws that sliced the Warriors�� deficit to six points, Livingston added three jumpers, the last with 8:59 left to cut it to 81-80.Despite following that spurt with a three-minute drought, the Warriors hung tough. Trailing 88-80, they rallied with seven consecutive points and later took their first lead since 2-0 when Clark nailed a floater with 1:25 left.“Well, I’m not really encouraged. This is how we were supposed to play,�� Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “We should have actually played better. We made too many mistakes.”Golden State surrendered 20 points off 14 turnovers and missed 19-of-25 three-point attempts.The Rockets sought early energy, and already leading 21-15, closed the first period with a 10-3 run.Harden was the linchpin, tallying seven consecutive points before Ariza turned a turnover into a transition dunk.Harden closed the quarter with a free throw, a pull-up jumper plus a basket following his offensive rebound for a 13-point advantage entering the second.Houston extended to a 53-36 lead when Jason Terry and Harden sank three-pointers, but that was when Speights went on his scorching streak.The Warriors closed the half with a 9-0 run following a technical foul on Howard. Speights drilled his third trey of the half with 2.4 seconds left to cap his 14-point period and cut the deficit to 55-48 at the break.	-7.25731321
NEW YORK/DETROIT, April 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. said it will move its U.S. sales headquarters from southern California to suburban Dallas, delivering the latest blow to California in a fight for jobs with arch-rival Texas, whose Governor Rick Perry has been actively poaching businesses from the Golden State.The relocation from Torrance, a Los Angeles-area city of about 150,000, will bring much of the Japanese automaker’s U.S. operations under one roof in Plano, Texas, including sales, service, marketing, advertising and quality. Also moving to Texas will be some manufacturing staff now based in Erlanger, Kentucky, and corporate operations staff based in New York City.Toyota is the largest employer in Torrance, accounting for more than 5 percent of all jobs in the city with 3,837 workers in 2013, according to the city’s annual financial report. About 2,000 people from Toyota Motor Sales in Torrance will be affected by the move, and about 4,000 U.S. employees in all, the company said.Toyota’s move, which will take place in stages between this summer and the end of 2016, is the latest by a major employer to defect to the Lone Star State from California. Toyota has been in California since 1957, when it set up shop at a former Rambler dealership in Hollywood.In February, Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it would move from Los Angeles to Houston. In 2009, power company Calpine Corp abandoned San Jose for Houston and in 2006 engineering company Fluor Corp. relocated to the Dallas area from Orange County.It’s “sad news,�� Torrance mayor Frank Scotto said at a press conference Monday. “Toyota has been an integral part of the city.�� He said his son-in-law works for Toyota, so he faces the prospect of having to travel to Texas to see his daughter and grandchildren.Toyota’s decision also means all three of the major Japanese carmakers will have stepped back from the state where they first got their footholds in the United States. Nissan Motor Co in 2006 moved most of its operations from Gardena, California, to Franklin, Tennessee, outside Nashville. Last year, Honda Motor Co decided to move a number of executives from Torrance to Columbus, Ohio.Perry has made luring businesses from other states a priority, making personal recruiting trips to sell what the Republican touts as a superior business climate, particularly lower taxes. California and New York State, both with Democratic governors, have been particular targets for the effort.On a poaching trip to New York last week, Perry challenged New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to a debate over which of the two states has a better business climate. There are about 50 people working in Toyota’s Manhattan office, and not all will be required to move.Toyota’s chief executive for North America, Jim Lentz, said Perry had no role in Toyota’s decision to move.Perry “is an interesting guy,�� Lentz said in an interview. “I’ve never met him. I talked to him on the phone today for the first time. This was never about Governor Perry courting us.”Some employees will begin to move this summer, though most won’t until construction of a new headquarters in Texas is completed in late 2016 or early 2017, the company said.Toyota has a truck assembly plant in San Antonio, Texas, as well as manufacturing and assembly plants in eight other states, including Kentucky, Indiana and Mississippi.Meanwhile, the departure from Torrance will leave more than a gap in employment.According to the city’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the company was also Torrance’s third-highest property taxpayer, with a taxable assessed value of $473 million or over 2 percent of the city’s total taxable assessed value last year. Toyota also paid the city $203,037 in water revenue.Torrance had a $271.5 million budget in 2013 and about $121.5 million in long-term debt. In December 2012, credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Torrance to Aa2 from Aa1, citing a moderately weakened general fund compared to pre-recession levels, increasing pension payments and public safety costs.The departure could also hurt efforts by Los Angeles to regain its footing in the job market. The region’s unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent in February, well above the national rate of 6.7 percent.The region has not kept pace with the nation in job creation. A report by the Los Angeles 2020 Commission released in December said Los Angeles is the only one of the seven largest U.S. cities to lose jobs since 1990, and Los Angeles County ranks last in California for creating jobs.The commission chastised Los Angeles for repeatedly ignoring or fumbling opportunities to foster job growth in the intersection of science and engineering, a major growth industry in the last era. Over a 30-year period ending in 2010, the city added 823,000 residents but lost more than 165,000 jobs, the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation highlighted in 2012.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T lifted its annual profit guidance, banking on stronger sales in its key U.S. market and a boost from a weaker yen, which put its Japanese manufacturing in the black for the first time in five years.But the world’s best-selling automaker, which shipped a record number of cars last year, said it would not build any new factories over the next three years despite the pickup in its fortunes, after it was burned in the financial crisis.Toyota raised its net profit forecast for the year to March by more than 10 percent to 860 billion yen ($9.3 billion) on strong U.S. sales of the Camry sedan and other vehicles.“If the current weak yen trend continues, the company’s profit will likely sharply rise for the next fiscal year as well,�� said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management.“If a recovery in the U.S. economy serves as a tailwind, its stock price has more upside.”The firm said it expected to ship 2.2 million vehicles in the U.S. this calendar year, up almost 6 percent from last year’s figure.Among Japan's big three automakers Toyota, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T, analysts see top seller Toyota as the most likely to benefit from a weakening yen because it has the highest ratio of production in Japan, more than half of which it exports.Japanese operations, including domestic manufacturing for export, used to generate about half of Toyota’s profit, but they started losing money after the Lehman Brothers crisis of 2008, until the yen’s recent weakening put them back into the black.The yen is trading around 92 to the dollar, compared with 78 at the start of October. The weaker the Japanese currency, the more money exporters make when they convert overseas profits back into yen.By contrast, Toyota's South Korean rival Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, which including its affiliate Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS is ranked fifth in global sales, last month posted a surprise quarterly profit drop as a stronger won dented its overseas earnings.Last week, Honda announced a third-quarter profit that was less than the market had expected, but believed the weaker yen would help to absorb the impact of poor demand in China and Europe.Nissan is due to announce its results on February 8.In 2013, Toyota expects to sell 8.9 million vehicles globally. Across the group, which includes Daihatsu Motor Co 7262.T and Hino Motors Ltd 7205.T, it forecasts shipping 9.91 million vehicles.Last year, the 75-year-old firm sold a record 8.72 million vehicles around the world. Its group-wide sales were also a record high of 9.75 million vehicles, beating General Motors Co GM.N to regain top rank among car manufacturers.Still, Toyota does not plan to dramatically ramp up production in the weak-yen environment.“It’s easy to confuse volume expansion with true growth as a company,�� Senior Managing Officer Takahiko Ijichi told reporters.“We’re getting rid of that way of doing business,�� he said, adding that the firm did not plan to build new plants for the next three years.Toyota posted net profit of 99.9 billion yen for the three months to December 31, up 23.5 percent from a year ago but below the average estimate of 143.7 billion yen among seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Behind the poorer-than-expected third quarter performance was the cost of settling a class action lawsuit in the United States over claims that millions of Toyota cars accelerate unintentionally.The firm booked 90 billion yen in costs related to the class action settlement, Toyota’s Ijichi said.Shares in Toyota have risen nearly 50 percent since mid-November on hopes the weakening yen will boost its bottom line, nearly double the 28 percent rise in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei average .N225 over the same period.Toyota shares ended down 1.2 percent on Tuesday at 4,540 yen before the earnings announcement, performing better than the Nikkei, which dropped 1.9 percent.	4.450738418

LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Toyota said on Wednesday it will build the next generation of its Auris car at its English plant in a welcome boost to Prime Minister Theresa May as Britain leaves the European Union, confirming a previous Reuters report.The Japanese carmaker will make its new Auris hatchback at Burnaston, Derbyshire, replacing the current run of the model made there, the company said in a statement.Sources said last year that Toyota plans to build the model in Britain on the assumption that ministers will secure a transitional Brexit deal, designed to maintain current trading conditions until at least the end of 2020.The automaker said free trade was important for the future.“With around 85 percent of our UK vehicle production exported to European markets, continued free and frictionless trade between the UK and Europe will be vital for future success,�� said Toyota Europe President and CEO Johan van Zyl in Wednesday’s statement.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts supplier Denso Corp 6902.T is buying an additional 4.5 percent stake in chipmaker Renesas Electronics 6723.T in a deal worth $800 million based on market prices, as car makers accelerate the adoption of self-driving and other technologies.Denso is an affiliate of and supplier to Japan's biggest automaker Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. It has been ramping up spending on research and development of new technologies including ""connected cars"". In February, Denso announced an investment in California cybersecurity startup Dellfer.It is acquiring the stake from Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), a state-backed fund that owns 50.1 percent in the chipmaker, INCJ said in a statement. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the transaction is worth about 85 billion yen ($796.9 million) based on Renesas�� share price.As a result of the deal, Denso’s stake in Renesas will rise to 5 percent, while INCJ’s will fall to 45.6.Renesas shares rose almost 9 percent on Friday after the news, before giving back some of the gains to be up 5 percent. Denso shares were down 0.1 percent. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index .N225 was up 0.2 percent in afternoon trade. Automakers and auto parts makers have been racing to develop new technologies as the sector shifts to electronic cars and automated driving, boosting the role of chips and software in cars.In a statement, Denso said it is “essential to further enhance collaboration with semiconductor manufacturers that have profound experience and expertise�� to develop vehicle control systems in automated driving and other new fields.Last week, Toyota said it would establish a new venture with Denso and another group supplier Aisin Seiki Co 7259.T, which would invest more than $2.8 billion to develop automated-driving software.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Toyota 7203.T said it could make a legal complaint against the official Brexit campaign for using its logo in leaflets, which the Japanese firm said might give the impression it backed Britain leaving the EU. On one ""Vote Leave"" flyer, Toyota's logo appeared next to those of five other major companies including Unilever and automakers Nissan 7201.T and Vauxhall GM.N with the message: ""Major employers ... have all said they'll stay in the UK whatever the result of the referendum.""Toyota, which built more than one in 10 of Britain’s 1.6 million new cars last year, said in February it believed a vote on June 23 to stay in the bloc would be better for its operations and long-term competitiveness.The firm said on Thursday that use of the logo could “mislead the reader into thinking that Toyota endorses the Vote Leave campaign�� and that it could take action against “unauthorized use of our trademarks.”Consumer goods maker Unilever ULVR.L has also complained to the ""Vote Leave"" campaign over the use of its name and logo. Unilever said the use of its logo was a “complete misrepresentation�� of its position and it planned to complain to Britain’s electoral watchdog the Electoral Commission.“We weren’t consulted or asked if we were happy for our name to appear. If we had been, we would never have allowed this to happen,�� a spokesman said in a statement. “Our position couldn’t be clearer. We firmly support Britain remaining.”Vote Leave did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by Reuters.Britain’s overwhelmingly foreign-owned car industry has spoken out in favor of continued British membership of the EU, which allows it to benefit from tariff-free access to the single market and the free movement of people within the world’s biggest trading bloc."	2.38372093
(In this August 27 story corrects Uber’s stated valuation to $76 billion instead of $72 billion in paragraph 5 after official correction from Uber)(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will invest $500 million in Uber Technologies Inc to jointly work on developing self-driving cars, the companies said on Monday, a bid by both to catch up to rivals in the hotly competitive autonomous driving business.Toyota, one of the world’s largest carmakers, and Uber [UBER.UL], the leading ride-hailing service, are widely seen as lagging the competition in developing self-driving cars.Their deal deepens an existing relationship and reflects CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s strategy of Uber developing autonomous vehicles through partnerships, rather than on its own.The deal also breathes new life into Uber’s self-driving business. Since a self-driving Uber SUV killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March, Uber has removed its robot cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona, its autonomous testing hub.The investment values Uber at $76 billion, a step up from the $72 billion valuation Uber received in a deal with Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O self-driving unit Waymo this year.Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota’s Guardian technology, which offers automated safety features such as lane-keeping but does not enable a vehicle to drive completely autonomously.The combined technology will be built into Toyota’s Sienna minivans, to be deployed on Uber’s ride-hailing network starting in 2021, Uber said.The companies�� aim is to solve the enormously challenging problem of how to mass produce self-driving cars for shared fleets, including ride-hailing services.Jeff Miller, Uber’s head of business development for strategic initiatives, said the partnership “really paints the picture of how we envision deploying autonomous technology in the long term.�� That includes licensing its autonomous technology to carmakers and enlisting a third party to own and maintain the fleet.The third party that will operate the Toyota autonomous fleet has not yet been chosen, Miller said.For the Japanese automaker, the “agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing that includes Toyota vehicles and technologies,�� its executive vice president Shigeki Tomoyama said in a statement.Toyota has been less aggressive than some rivals on moving toward full-fledged autonomous driving, expressing caution about the technology and focusing on partial autonomous systems like Guardian. But it has invested in research and plans to begin testing self-driving electric cars around 2020.A Toyota official said the company would continue its research into self-driving technology, and that it would not combine its research efforts with Uber.Uber has admitted its technology lags Waymo, and the crash in Arizona was a further setback in development and testing. The Toyota partnership puts pressure on Uber to resume testing on public roads, but the company has run up against regulators and politicians with safety concerns. Miller said Uber plans to have autonomous cars back on public streets by the end of the year.Khosrowshahi, who took over Uber a year ago, has recently explored options that include more partnerships as well as a potential sale of the self-driving business, separate sources have told Reuters. The self-driving unit is a significant contributor to Uber’s losses, which in the second quarter were $891 million.Uber has a deal to buy cars from Volvo, outfit them with Uber’s technology and maintain them, a more labor-intensive project than the Toyota plans.The company also has a partnership with Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, in which the carmaker proposes to put its own self-driving cars in Uber's ride-hailing network. Khosrowshahi’s partnership strategy is a shift. Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick had insisted on developing a proprietary self-driving system and called autonomous cars “existential�� to Uber.Previously, Uber and Toyota partnered on an electric mobility project. Two years ago, Toyota invested an undisclosed sum in Uber and the two companies partnered on a car-leasing program for Uber drivers. Uber has since shuttered its U.S. leasing business.	-1.158086777
TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is considering shutting all its domestic car manufacturing plants for at least a week from Feb. 8 due to steel shortage following an explosion at its group firm Aichi Steel this month, TV broadcaster TBS News reported on Friday night.The heating furnace at Aichi Steel’s Chita plant in central Japan exploded on Jan. 8, denting production of special steel parts, the company has said, adding it aims to resume operations in March.Toyota Motor could not be immediately available for comment.Kyodo News said Toyota would stop overtime next week at all its production plants in Japan and added that a production halt was possible from Feb. 8.Toyota manufacturers around 13,000 to 14,000 vehicles a day in Japan, Kyodo said.

(Reuters) - Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it is spending $1.33 billion in its Kentucky plant as part of a plan to invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years.The investment in the plant, Toyota’s largest, comes amid uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies that could affect certain Japanese firms�� capital expenditure plans.Trump criticized the automaker earlier this year and said he would impose a hefty fee if it built its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico.Toyota joins a host of automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE that have announced investments in the United States since Trump won the U.S. election.Even U.S. car manufacturers Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors GM.N have announced plans to spend more domestically.“Toyota’s decision to invest $1.3 billion in their Kentucky plant is further evidence that manufacturers are now confident that the economic climate has greatly improved under my administration��, Trump said in the statement issued by Toyota.Toyota said that the investment would help in its new production process that would allow for a more flexible production environment, helping its build better cars and respond quicker to customers.The Kentucky plant employs about 8,200 workers and Toyota recently booted the count by more than 700 ahead of the launch of the new version of Camry.	0.4135338346
DETROIT (Reuters) - The recovery of Detroit’s automakers is about to face its stiffest challenge yet on an unlikely battlefield: The sizzling market for midsize family sedans, as General Motors and Ford square off against Japanese, Korean and German rivals.This fall, consumers have the chance to kick the tires on the redesigned 2013 Ford Fusion and GM’s Chevrolet Malibu.But the two vehicles face an uphill fight against the three market leaders - the Toyota Camry 7203.T, Honda Accord 7267.T and Nissan Altima - all of which are new or recently redesigned. Add in the latest offerings of the Hyundai Sonata 005380.KS, Volkswagen Passat VOWG_p.DE and Chrysler's existing 200 and Dodge Avenger cars, and the market is as crowded as it has ever been.The U.S. automakers have consistently fallen short in this sector for nearly two decades, trailing Toyota and Honda since the mid-1990s, but it is now essential that they recover some of that lost share as the segment is becoming more important.Sales of midsize family cars are up 23 percent through August this year versus 15 percent for the whole industry - partly a reflection of newer, edgier designs with better fuel economy, more premium features and fresh technology.A lot is at stake. Detroit’s Big Three may have recovered since the financial crisis thanks to government bailouts and generous loans, but they are still struggling to find a path to sustainable growth.“Now it’s absolutely critical�� for Detroit to be successful in the midsize segment, says Patrick Archambault, auto analyst with Goldman Sachs. “If you don’t have a viable product in that segment, you’re screwed in the longer term.”Their recent record has been mixed. GM GM.N and Chrysler have returned from near-death to profitability, and Ford F.N has resumed paying dividends. But GM's stock continues to languish - it closed at $24.42 on Thursday, down 26 percent from its 2010 IPO price of $33, while Ford is down 37 percent in the same period.“Everyone has upped their game�� in midsize family sedans, observes Jim Farley, a former Toyota sales executive who is now Ford’s global marketing chief. Farley says the Detroit brands “are more competitive than they have been�� in midsize cars - “but so is everyone.”Detroit has a chance to regain some lost ground - but the competition has become much more ferocious, says Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Automotive Consulting in Novi, Michigan. “The companies with the most at stake are the Japanese,�� says Robinet.He notes that the U.S., German and Korean brands “all are raising their game substantially in this segment,�� while traditional midsize stalwarts Toyota and Honda “have the most to lose and the most to defend.”The best American hope may be the 2013 Ford Fusion, which will reach showrooms in mid-October.Models like the Fusion “have significantly narrowed the gap�� with the best Japanese-branded midsize cars for performance, features, quality and appeal, says Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of LMC Automotive in Troy, Michigan.It is a radical departure from previous models, inspired by the smaller European-designed Fiesta and Focus. The new Fusion will share its basic underpinnings and much of its crisply styled sheet metal with the new European Mondeo, which debuts later this month at the Paris Auto Show.The Fusion will sport advanced technology, from Ford’s acclaimed Ecoboost turbocharged direct-injection engine to the much-maligned MyFord Touch infotainment system. The Fusion Hybrid will also deliver up to 47 miles per gallon.“Among the domestics, the new Fusion is probably the most important car in the segment,�� says consultant Maryann Keller, president of Maryann Keller Associates in Greenwich, Connecticut.The latest edition of the Honda Accord presents the toughest challenge for the Fusion. The ninth-generation Accord hit dealer lots in early September just ahead of the nameplate’s 30th anniversary as the first Japanese car to be built in the United States.The 2013 Accord, while it doesn’t appear to stray too far stylistically from its predecessor, “has a very strong competitive edge,�� says Tetsuo Iwamura, chief executive of Honda North America. “There is no compromise at all. It has class-leading fuel economy (and) it’s very much fun to drive.”The midsize market, which could account for about 3.3 million sales this year, is beginning to look dichotomous, analysts say, which could favor the European-flavored Fusion over the more conservatively styled Accord.“There are two different (types of) buyers in the segment now,�� says Schuster. “There is still a market for the conservative, traditional midsize vehicle and one that is more progressive, more focused on design than (just) on dependability and reliability.”Farley says Ford is targeting an emerging group of buyers �� the U.S. automaker labels them “Generation Flux�� �� who are not Toyota or Honda loyalists, but fluctuate among brands. “They’re not just on autopilot,�� he says.Both the Fusion and the Accord must battle the popular Toyota Camry, which was redesigned a year ago and has been the top-selling passenger car in the United States for 14 of the past 15 years (Accord was number one in 2001). So far this year, the Camry is running away from the pack, steadily widening its lead over the Accord and the Altima.The Camry’s redesign a year ago was seen as a deliberate, albeit modest step away from the stodgy image Toyota has carefully cultivated since the nameplate’s launch in 1983.Toyota benefits from “a large number of buyers on the road who trust in Toyota and trust in the nameplate Camry - that’s a huge advantage going in,�� says Jim Lentz, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. But the automaker also has attracted younger buyers with its redesigned Camry; the average age in the past year has dropped to 52 from 60, according to Lentz.Family buyers “want more emotion from their cars, whether it’s exterior styling, sophistication of interior, in terms of design and materials (or) driving dynamics,�� adds Lentz, who says those trends likely will accelerate in the future as Gen Y consumers mature and enter the segment.Pricing in the sector is competitive and doesn’t seem to be a differentiator. The top six sellers have base prices that range from $21,670 to $23,150. Depending on trim level and options, the sticker easily can exceed $30,000.When vehicle shortages caused by last year’s earthquake off the Japanese coast forced Toyota and Honda owners to look elsewhere, one of the beneficiaries was the Altima, which finished 2011 in second place behind the Camry and so far this year is jockeying with the Accord for the number-two slot. The redesigned Altima now offers a frugal four-cylinder engine that runs at 38 miles per gallon on the highway.The Fusion and the Malibu currently remain a distant fourth and fifth, respectively, in the midsize segment through the first eight months Of the year.GM’s new Malibu has some initial handicaps. It isn’t very different from its predecessor and Chevy dealers have been hampered because the only 2013 Malibu they had to sell until this fall was the Malibu Eco, whose $26,095 base sticker is higher than that of many competitors, while highway mileage of 37 miles per gallon trails similar hybrids. Lower-priced gasoline versions of the Malibu are only now going on sale.Beyond the top five are the Sonata, which was restyled and upgraded in model year 2011, and the Passat, which received a complete redesign last year and is being produced not in Europe, as before, but at a new $1 billion plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee �� moves that enabled VW to shave thousands off the sticker price.And Chrysler can't be forgotten. Its takeover by Italian automaker Fiat SpA FIA.MI could help lift the U.S. company's game in midsize cars, where it has never been a significant player. But a brand-new Chrysler 200, based on a Fiat platform from Europe, is not due to arrive until early 2014.“You’ve really got to put your best foot forward in this segment if you’re going to be a winner,�� says Brian Carolin, senior vice president of sales and marketing at Nissan North America.	-1.900621118
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday said production at all of its China plants would remain suspended through Feb. 16, joining a growing number of automakers facing stoppages due to supply chain issues as the coronavirus spreads.The Japanese automaker, which operates 12 vehicle and components factories in China, said it would extend its production stoppage “after considering various factors, including guidelines from local and region governments, parts supply, and logistics.“For the week of Feb. 10, we will be preparing for the return to normal operation from Feb. 17 and beyond,�� it said in a statement.The decision extends Toyota’s initial plans to suspend operations through Sunday, and comes as the threat from the coronavirus crisis closes in on the global auto industry.South Korea's Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS said on Friday that they plan to restart production at their Chinese factories on Feb. 17, from a previously planned Feb.9. “We will take preventive measures against infection at factories,�� a spokeswoman said.A growing number of car makers, including those who do not make cars in China, are flagging the possibility that their global operations could take a hit if they cannot access parts supplies from the country, where there are transportation bans to stop the virus spreading.Suzuki Motor Corp said it was looking at the possibility of procuring “made in China�� car parts from other regions if it cannot access parts due to ongoing stoppages.The Japanese automaker does not produce or sell any cars in China, but procures some components there for its plants in India, where it controls around half of the passenger vehicle market via its local unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI on Thursday said one of its European plants could close within two to four weeks if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work soon, while Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS earlier this week suspended production at its South Korean plants due to a shortage of China-made parts.Parts made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled elsewhere, and China’s Hubei province - the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak - is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.To limit the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities have announced an extended holiday period in Hubei and 10 other provinces, which account for more than two-thirds of the country’s vehicle production.IHS Automotive projects plant closures through Feb. 10 would result in a 7% cut in vehicle production in China for the first quarter.In a note, its analysts said extended closures into March may result in lost production of over 1.7 million vehicles for the period, a decline of roughly one-third of pre-virus output expectations.“If the situation lingers into mid-March, and plants in adjacent provinces are also idled, the China-wide supply chain disruption caused by parts shortages from Hubei, a major component hub, could have a wide-reaching impact,�� they said.Other industry experts said suppliers had built up a cushion of parts in inventory and in-transit ahead of the long Lunar New Year holiday in late January. Those will start to run out if factories cannot get back to work next week, or if flights to and from China remain limited.Toyota said its plants outside China were operating as normal for the moment but it has said it was also considering the possibility of manufacturing parts commonly made in China in other regions.	-13.73471969

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s automakers association (JAMA) on Friday criticized moves by the United States to explore raising tariffs on Japanese auto exports, just as the two countries plan trade talks in July that may increase pressure on Tokyo to open up its markets.Washington last month launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports which could lead to new tariffs on one of Japan’s major export products to the United States.New tariffs on auto imports could raise costs for Japanese automakers doing business in the United States, the world’s No. 2 auto market. The probe follows a U.S. decision to slap new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Japan and other countries earlier this year.""The investigation launched by the United States Department of Commerce to determine the effects on national security of imports of automobiles ... will create uncertainty among automobile users in the U.S. and people involved in the motor vehicle industry,"" Akio Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and president of Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said in a statement.He said that if restrictions were implemented, they would raise vehicle prices and reduce available options, penalizing consumers. They could also seriously disrupt the plans of automakers, components makers and dealers, “with potentially adverse impacts on the U.S. economy and jobs��.As trade tensions between the two countries heat up, U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday agreed to make preparations to hold trade meetings in July which will be based around a new framework focusing on bilateral trade, Japan’s foreign ministry said.The talks will be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japan Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.The United States is a major market for Japan’s automakers, which produced 3.8 million vehicles at their U.S. plants in 2017, roughly one-third of the 12 million total units produced in the country each year.An additional 1.7 million vehicles were exported from Japan last year.Most of Japan's major automakers operate plants in the United States and top producers Toyota, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Honda Motor Co. 7267.T locally produce between roughly half and 70 percent of all vehicles sold in the country.But they also operate plants in Mexico and Canada, exporting a portion of the output from those plants, along with some vehicles made in other countries, to the United States.Analysts say a new trade framework could put Japan under direct U.S. pressure to enter talks for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA).Japan is wary of entering such talks as they would put it under pressure to open up politically-sensitive markets like agriculture, while policymakers fear that Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Japanese cars, could be more damaging to the economy than metal tariffs.In a sign of Japan’s irritation, Finance Minister Taro Aso used unusually harsh language to criticize Trump’s trade policy at a Group of Seven finance leaders�� gathering last week.“It’s deeply deplorable,�� Aso told reporters. “Inward-looking policies involving one-sided, protectionist measures benefit no country,�� he said."	-4.045224286
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto industry sales in August will be about even with a year ago, not quite ending the summer in a sizzling fashion but still warm enough to continue the recovery from a recession now five years in the rear-view mirror.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect monthly sales of about 1.5 million new vehicles when automakers report them on Wednesday, with a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 16.6 million. It should be the sixth straight month showing an annualized rate above 16 million, a level reached only twice in 2013.Auto sales are a closely watched indicator of consumer demand, particularly for big-ticket items, and the industry accounts for roughly one-fifth of all U.S. retail spending.While sales would be flat with last August, the annualized rate for the month would be up from 16.1 million a year ago because there was one less selling day this year.Profit-eroding incentives remained high in August, as dealers trimmed prices to help clear lots and make way for 2015 models. Industry research firm Kelley Blue Book said incentives, including rebates and cash-back offers, were on track to end the month between $2,700 to $3,000 per vehicle.The biggest discounts were on mid-size sedans, which are staying on dealer lots more than 80 days before being sold, compared to 47 days for small crossover sport utility vehicles, Kelley Blue Book said.While auto sales have strengthened to nearly pre-recession levels, there is concern among some analysts that longer-term loans and increased lending to subprime buyers may be inflating sales. Some new vehicles are being sold with 7-year loans, which could cause owners to hold onto their cars longer, because equity is not established until late in the pay-off cycle.Chrysler Group LLC, a unit of Fiat SpA FIA.MI, and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T once again gained market share in August to the detriment of sales leaders General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, according to analysts.Eight analysts polled by Reuters expect Chrysler to show a monthly sales gain of 13.5 percent, while Nissan is seen ending August up 2.4 percent. Among major automakers, the two are expected to be the only winners.Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book, expects Chrysler will only enjoy a few more months of double-digit gains. This year’s gains by Chrysler have been helped by the fact that sales of Jeep Cherokee SUVs were compared to low sales of a model it replaced in late 2013, the Jeep Liberty.The Reuters poll showed monthly sales declines for GM, down 1.2 percent, Ford, down 1.4 percent, Toyota, down 2.3 percent and Honda Motor Co 7267.T off 7.9 percent. Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS are seen down a combined 0.8 percent.	1.135972461
(Recasts with source confirmation)TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp are in talks to expand their technology partnership to fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), sources said on Saturday, as global automakers face rising costs to comply with stricter emission regulations.The two Japanese automakers already have a technology and production tie-up, and Toyota was now considering providing fuel-cell and plug-in-hybrid technology to Mazda, said the two sources, who were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.Mazda, in return, was considering offering its partner fuel-efficient gasoline and diesel engine technology under its proprietary SkyActiv series, the sources said.Mazda has been trying to develop FCVs on its own, but it has decided to team up with Toyota, which produces the Mirai, the world’s only mass-market fuel-cell car, the sources said.Toyota has said hydrogen FCVs offer the most promising zero-emission alternative to conventional cars since they have a similar driving range and refuelling time.Toyota has already decided to share some of its patents concerning fuel cell technology for free, hoping this will speed up the development of the infrastructure.The Nikkei business daily reported the two companies intended to reach an agreement on the partnership soon.Toyota and Mazda officials said nothing has been decided.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is likely to miss its 2014 objective of selling over 1.1 million vehicles in China because of a faster-than-anticipated economic slowdown and resulting price war in the local auto market.Toyota and its two Chinese joint ventures will miss the goal and will sell slightly more than 1 million vehicles in 2015, two company executives told Reuters. Researcher IHS Automotive puts sales at 1.09 million in 2014 and 1.15 million in 2015.The shortcoming reveals continued difficulty for Japanese automakers in China even as diplomatic relations recover from a territorial spat that turned Chinese consumers against Japanese goods. Compounding matters is an increase in models from premium German brands priced within reach of mainstream Japanese cars.“Toyota can resort to a fire sale and meet our sales targets, but our philosophy is to produce and sell as many as a market wants, not much more,�� said one of the executives. “We try to stay away from price wars as much as we can.”The Japanese automaker has unofficially aimed for 1 million vehicles in China since 2010, coming close with 917,500 vehicles in 2013.But with economic growth nearing its slowest rate in 24 years, Toyota has had to revise sales plans gradually since the third quarter, said the executives, who were not authorized to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.Projected 2014 sales for the automaker’s luxury brand Lexus, for example, are now roughly 75,000 cars from an original target of 85,000, they said. Toyota is scheduled to release full-year figures on Jan. 6.Another reason for slower-than-planned sales at Toyota - as well as at compatriots Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Honda Motor Co Ltd - is competition from premium German brands such as BMW, said one of the Toyota executives.Dealers of those brands have tried to meet planned growth rates by heavily discounting cars at the lower end of product line-ups, making prices comparable to non-premium Japanese cars.For instance, BMW’s 3-Series starts at about 283,000 yuan while the most expensive version of Toyota’s Camry mid-sized sedan costs 275,000 yuan.“When the BMW 3-Series is given a 10 percent or more discount, it really squeezes sales of the Camry and similarly priced cars in our line-up,�� said one of the Toyota executives.A BMW spokesman declined to comment.Toyota sold about 907,400 vehicles in China in January-November, up 12.2 percent, aided by several redesigned models including the high-volume Corolla compact, as well as the China launch of the Vios and Yaris subcompacts.A relative dearth of redesigned models for 2015 will leave growth in the new year more or less on par with that of the overall market, the two executives said. IHS sees the market growing 7.1 percent to 24.9 million vehicles.There may only be one significant redesign of a mainstream Toyota-brand model, said one of the executives, namely the Crown sedan which is “not a huge volume generator.��	4.955920896
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Honda Motor Co 7267.T reported a 16% drop in first-quarter operating profit on Friday, as a stronger yen weighed on overseas earnings and U.S. vehicle sales dropped.Japan’s No.3 automaker posted operating income of 252.4 billion yen ($2.36 billion) for the April-June period, compared with 299.3 billion yen a year ago and an average forecast of 246.9 billion yen from seven analysts polled by Refinitiv.The company’s U.S. sales fell to 407,000 vehicles over the three-month period, from 425,000 vehicles a year earlier.It lowered its forecast for global sales in the year to March 2020 to 5.11 million vehicles, from its prior projection of 5.16 million and a record 5.323 million sold last year.Honda, however, reiterated its forecast for a 6% increase in operating profit to 770 billion yen for this fiscal year.Honda, like other car makers, has been scrambling to reinvent itself amid rising competition from technology firms - such as Google parent Alphabet GOOGL.O and Uber UBER.N - as the auto industry moves toward vehicles that are shared, autonomous and electric. In May, Honda signaled that it was looking to cut global production costs by 10% by 2025 and scale back regional model variations, channeling savings into research and development.The company has also expanded partnerships, joining mobility project by SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, and investing in General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise self-driving vehicle unit.	2.031795269
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor posted its smallest quarterly net profit in five years, falling dismally short of estimates, and warned the second half of 2017 would be challenging as political headwinds hit sales in China and slow U.S. demand continues.The South Korean firm - which together with affiliate Kia Motors is the world’s No.5 automaker - has been betting earnings will recover gradually, but its plans have ground to a halt with China’s backlash over Seoul’s decision to deploy an anti-missile system, the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), showing no signs of abating.Slower demand in the United States, the automaker’s No.2 market after China, has also been taking a toll, a trend the South Korean firm cautioned will persist through the rest of the year with its mainstay Sonata sedans losing ground in a market powered by sport utility vehicles (SUVs).“The challenging business environment is expected to persist in the second half because of negative external factors such as a slowdown in U.S. demand and China’s THAAD issue,�� Hyundai CFO Choi Byung-chul said at an earnings conference call.Earlier on Wednesday, Hyundai Motor said its second-quarter net profit halved from a year ago to 817 billion won ($729.14 million) - its 14th straight year-on-year fall and the smallest since the first quarter of 2012. Analysts on average had expected 1.35 trillion won.Its operating profit came in at 1.34 trillion won and sales at 24.31 trillion won for the period.The company is aiming to shore up its global sales through new models likes its Kona small SUV and Genesis G70 sports sedan, the CFO said at the briefing.Hyundai Motor’s retail sales in China, the world’s biggest auto market, slumped 29 percent in the first half of 2017.Its weak brand image has also put Hyundai at a disadvantage versus local and global rivals such as Honda Motor, Toyota Motor and General Motors, which all saw higher China sales for last month. GM, in its earnings call on Tuesday, said it set second-quarter sales record in China.Hyundai Motor plans to open a new factory in Chongqing in late August, hoping to offset some of its sales slide by tapping into the southwestern region, even as its other factories in the eastern region are underutilized.In the United States, Hyundai Motor’s sales over January-June fell 7.4 percent, the second biggest drop after affiliate Kia Motors. The slump came despite the automaker sharply boosting incentives to buoy sales.Its U.S. incentives jumped 32 percent to an average of $2,800 per vehicle in the first half, from a year earlier.It is set to face more pressure as competition rises in the United States, where Asian rivals such as Honda and Toyota will be launching their newest-generation mid-sized sedans this month, going up against the facelifted Sonata to be offered by Hyundai Motor even as sedan sales weaken worldwide.Hyundai Motor shares trimmed earlier gains after the earnings announcement, ending up 1.4 percent versus the wider market that was down 0.2 percent.	1.868737023
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt wants to create an investment arm to channel funds to projects along the Suez Canal to take advantage of proximity to one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, the chairman of The Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) said.The government has been directing billions of dollars of investment over recent years to upgrade infrastructure around the Suez Canal, seeking to attract the logistics, maritime services, manufacturing, information technology and power industries.The zone, one of the country’s megaprojects, has been in the pipeline for at least two decades but has received fresh impetus since Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi became president in 2014, with the government hoping it will become a major engine of growth and jobs.“We’d like to see a financial arm to this ... It can go into partnership with developers. It will go to banks and lending banks and investment banks and so on to create a particular opportunity,�� SCZone Chairman Yehia Zaki said on Sunday at a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.“We are now preparing its scope and incorporation. The intention is to create an investment and commercial arm.”The SCZone is made up of six ports and four industrial zones scattered along the waterway, through which passes almost 10% of world trade, or 18,000 ships a year.Zaki, who took up his post five months ago, said the SCZone has been working with financial institutions and banks to monetize land, infrastructure and cash flow.“We can go to special bonds, we can go to multilateral development banks, we’ll go to commercial banks,�� he said.The government has built tunnels under and bridges over the canal and laid out highways as well as desalination, electricity and water treatment plants. It is also expanding its natural gas network to boost supplies from new fields both on and offshore.The zone has projects to build new cargo terminals at ports at East Port Said and Sokhna and is upgrading other ports at Adabiya, West Port Said, al-Tor and al-Arish.The SCZone last month signed a contract with a consortium led by Toyota Tsusho Corp 8015.T, owned by Japan’s Toyota Group, to set up a roll on, roll off terminal at East Port Said at an investment cost of almost $160 million. It is also nearing agreement with Dubai World [DBWLD.UL] on a deal to develop the port areas with potential investment of $600 million, Zaki said.	0.5200541426

(Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Thursday it will make automatic emergency braking (AEB) standard on an estimated one million vehicles sold in the United States for model year 2018.Seven of the Japanese automaker’s models, including Rogue, Altima and Murano, will come with the AEB standard, the company said.AEB uses radar technology to monitor a vehicle’s proximity to the one ahead and warns the driver through audio and visual displays to reduce speed, helping avoid or reduce the severity of potential collisions.U.S. auto safety regulators said last year that 20 automakers, including Nissan, General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Daimler AG and Honda Motor Co, had agreed to make automatic emergency braking standard on nearly all U.S. vehicles by 2022.In 2012, rear-end collisions killed 1,705 people and injured 547,000 in the United States. About 87 percent of the deaths and injuries might have been prevented or lessened if vehicles had a collision avoidance system because they were linked to driver inattention, researchers found.	2.345375449
* Ford the No. 1 seller in Canada in March* Chrysler Canada sales rise 8 pct* In U.S., auto sales continue at robust pace in MarchApril 3 (Reuters) - Canadian auto sales rose for a third consecutive month in March, and Ford regained its crown as the No. 1 seller, but the pace of sales slowed as demand returned to what Ford Canada’s chief executive said was a “more realistic�� level.Industry sales rose 2.8 percent in March to 157,750 cars and trucks, according to statistics compiled by independent automotive consultants, DesRosiers.Continued demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars drove the increase, which was considerably smaller than the sales gains in Canada in the first two months of the year.January’s 15.4 percent jump in sales followed by February’s 11.2 percent rise “surprised us a bit��, said Ford Canada CEO Dianne Craig.“We are probably returning to more realistic levels for this year,�� she said in an interview at the Vancouver Auto Show.With Canadian economic growth still sluggish, industry observers had not expected red-hot sales this year.Fuel economy remains “top of mind��, Craig said. Passenger car sales rose to 73,645 last month, up 6.5 percent from March 2011. Sales of less fuel-efficient light trucks dipped 0.3 percent to 84,105.South of the border no slowdown was evident. U.S. auto sales rose more than 15 percent in March, preliminary data showed, as rising consumer confidence and cheap financing quickened the pace of an auto-sales recovery more than two years in the making.In Canada, Ford, which had lost its longstanding position as the top seller to fellow Detroit automaker Chrysler in the first two months of the year, regained the title even as its sales dipped 3.3 percent to 24,690 in March from March 2011.Craig blamed the dip on a tough comparison with last March, when sales at Ford, whose line-up includes the popular Ford Focus compact and F-Series trucks, hit a 12-year record.Although overtaken by Ford in March, Chrysler said it sold more vehicles in Canada in the first quarter of 2012 than any of its competitors with demand especially strong for its line-up of passenger cars.Sales at Chrysler, which makes Ram pick-up trucks as well as Jeep, Dodge and Fiat models, rose 8 percent in March to 22,703, the company said. Chrysler said its sales were up 12 percent at 55,823 in the first quarter from the first three months of 2011.Chrysler was No. 3 in sales in Canada last year behind Ford Canada and General Motors.Sales of Chrysler trucks, up 1.6 percent at 18,361 last month, still dwarfed sales passenger cars at 4,342. But car sales were up 50 percent from March 2011.General Motors, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac brands, took third spot in Canada as its sales fell 7.4 percent to 22,684.Toyota Canada sales were a touch weaker at 16,054. Hybrids accounted for 10.5 percent of all Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold in March, the company said.“Canadians look for fuel efficiency and value in a vehicle..,�� said Tony Wearing, senior managing director of Toyota Canada Inc.	-5.944976077
TOKYO, May 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is expected to post operating profit of around 1.3 trillion yen ($13.1 billion) for the year ended March, 3.7 times more than the previous year, the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday.That figure will be 150 billion yen more than the forecast the automaker made in February, the Nikkei, said without citing its sources.Toyota’s annual operating profit has not exceeded 1 trillion yen since the Lehman crisis of 2008, it said. The company posted 2.27 trillion yen operating profit for the year through March 2008, the report said.In February, Toyota raised its net profit forecast for the year through March by more than 10 percent to 860 billion yen on strong U.S. sales of the Camry sedan and other vehicles.Toyota’s press office was unavailable for comment. Monday is a public holiday in Japan.	-0.1390941494
TOYOTA CITY, Japan (Reuters) - Engineers, supported by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, demonstrated their flying car on Saturday, which they hope will be able to light up the Olympic flame for the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games.“Cartivator��, a start-up group of about 30 engineers including some young Toyota employees, started to develop a flying car “SkyDrive�� in 2014 with the help of crowdfunding.Head of Cartivator, Tsubasa Nakamura, said that while the car was still at an early stage of development, the group expects to conduct the first manned-flight by the end of 2018.During their demonstration, the current test model was able to get off and float on the ground for a few seconds. Nakamura said the design needed more stability so the prototype would be able to fly long and high enough to reach the Olympic flame.Engineers of Cartivator are aiming to make their flying car the world’s smallest electric vehicle, which can be used in small urban areas, and hopes to commercialize the car in 2025.Last month, Toyota Motor and its group of companies agreed to invest 42.5 million yen ($385,000) in the project for the next three years. Nakamura said the group is working hard to improve the design, hoping to receive further investment from the company.Companies in the world have been competing to develop the first flying car or vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicles. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] announced its plan to deploy its flying taxi service by 2020 in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Dubai. Airbus Group is also working on developing its flying car under its division called Urban Air Mobility.But makers of “flying cars�� still face hurdles, including convincing regulators and the public that their products can be used safely. Governments are still grappling with regulations for drones and driverless cars.	0.7145508537

Logano ends Xfinity dry spell with win at PhoenixBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeAVONDALE, Ariz. -- Joey Logano summed up his dominating victory in one word.“Finally!�� Logano exclaimed after taking the checkered flag in Saturday’s Axalta Faster at Phoenix International Raceway.Logano had reason to be frustrated. He had finished second in his last four Xfinity Series starts, the last three after winning the pole. And the driver of the No. 22 Team Penske Ford hadn’t been to Victory Lane in the series since Sept. 28, 2013, at Dover International Speedway.On Saturday, however, Logano won the pole and closed the deal. Though race runner-up Matt Kenseth dogged his rear bumper all day and closed to .294 of a second at the finish, he couldn’t catch the No. 22 Ford, which led 176 of the 200 laps at the one-mile track.“It felt good,�� said Logano, who collected his second win at Phoenix and the 22nd of his career. “It took a long time to get our next win. We’ve been so close to winning -- obviously, a lot of poles and things are going well. We just needed a little more speed, and it was awesome to get it today.”Logano, who posted the second perfect driver rating of his career, pulled away after a restart on Lap 144 and stayed out front the rest of the way, with Kenseth in close pursuit.“I was able to take off faster on restarts and get a nice lead and then Matt’s car was looser than mine, so that is why I was able to get a lead,�� Logano said. “Once we started running a few laps, I would get tight and he would start catching up to me because his balance was a little more free.“I kept hoping for lapped traffic because I was better in traffic and that’s where I made up time.”Kenseth thought he had a better car for the longer runs, but traffic and dirty air proved his downfall.“For whatever reason, after our last pit stop, we just didn’t fire off as fast,�� Kenseth said. “I had way less grip than (after) every other pit stop ... He (Logano) got away pretty good, and then when it was time to go, I just got tight running him down with all the lapped cars, and I couldn’t quite get there.”Kevin Harvick ran third, followed by Austin Dillon and Erik Jones, subbing for injured Kyle Busch in the No. 54 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota. Ty Dillon came home sixth and retained the series lead by 14 points over 14th-place finisher Chris Buescher.NASCAR XFINITY Series Race - Axalta Faster Tougher Brighter 200Phoenix International RacewayAvondale, ArizonaSaturday, March 14, 20151.

TOKYO, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers, led by Nissan Motor Co, have lost an estimated $250 million in output because of anti-Japan protests in China this week and now face the risk that sales will sputter in the world’s largest car market.Chinese protesters took to the streets this week in response to an escalating dispute with Japan over ownership of a group of isles in the East China Sea, prompting Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Nissan to temporarily halt operations at plants in China.Lost production volume from those suspensions amounted to around 14,000 vehicles as of Thursday, according to an estimate by IHS Automotive. That would mean immediate lost revenue of about $250 million, based on an average vehicle sticker price of about $18,000 for the Japanese brands.That toll could rise. Toyota said some of its China plants are still suspended, without specifying. Honda also has two factories halted, while Nissan has resumed operations.Nissan has been the most successful Japanese automaker in China, and is most exposed now. Its projected sales in China account for 27 percent of its global sales volume, compared with 18 percent for Honda and 11 percent for Toyota.Industry executives and analysts said automakers would be able to make up for lost output by running more overtime.“What is more important is how consumers will react from now on,�� said Koichi Sugimoto, a senior analyst at BHP Paribas. “It wouldn’t be strange if some people start thinking that it’s better to buy South Korean cars then Japanese ones so that their cars won’t be destroyed by demonstrators.”Moody’s credit rating agency said it was hard to predict how “rising anti-Japanese sentiment�� would affect business.“The possible implications - in an extreme and unanticipated scenario - could include the loss of access to a significant and growing market ... or a reduction in the ability of Japanese manufacturers to locate facilities in China.”�CAR IS JAPANESE, MIND IS CHINESE”With immediately recognisable logos, Japanese cars became a target of havoc for anti-Japan protesters in China. Protesters burned a Toyota dealership in Qingdao and several more dealerships suffered damage, a company spokesman said.A Honda dealership in Beijing sent out text messages warning customers to be careful. Photos circulated online of Japanese cars carrying banners such as “Car is Japanese, Mind is Chinese�� and “From now on, I will boycott Japanese goods��.Some Japanese companies are coming up with contingency plans in case tension escalates. Brake supplier Akebono Brake Industry is preparing contingency plans in case it faces problems in importing materials needed to supply automakers in China, the company’s CEO told Reuters on Thursday.Japanese firms lag rivals General Motors Co and Volkswagen in China but remain keen on expansion.Toyota aims to double sales in China to 1.8 million cars by 2015. Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota, said Chinese consumers would recognise the contributions of Japanese automakers and their Chinese partners to the Chinese economy.“I hope the problem will be resolved soon so that Japanese cars will be back on shopping lists,�� he told reporters.For its part, Nissan plans to boost sales in China to 2.3 million vehicles in 2015 and has launched the made-in-China brand name Venucia together with its joint venture partner Dongfeng Motor Group Co.Reflecting market worries about the fallout, Nissan’s Credit Default Swaps have been rising all week and hit a six-week high on Thursday.Sales in China’s auto market grew sharply in 2009 and 2010, but growth fell to 5.2 percent in 2011. Sales are up 4 percent in 2012 so far.The Toyota Camry, Nissan Teana and Honda Accord represent three of the top five selling mid-size cars in China.While the current tension may create an opening for brands like Hyundai, auto market share is unlikely to shift much as long as Beijing moves to contain the protests, said Michael Dunne, a Hong Kong-based auto consultant.“It’s a secret to no one that there is a certain animosity that Chinese people feel to Japan for historical reasons. At the same time, it has not stopped them from buying millions of Japanese cars,�� he said. “As much as they love their flag, they love their money more.��	-3.104294479
CAPE TOWN, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Toyota South Africa operations were halted on Monday at its Durban assembly plant and a Johannesburg warehouse due to a strike by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), a company spokesman said.“The strike has resulted in the suspension of operations today,�� Clynton Yon said in a statement.The union said in a statement it would continue its strike until its demands are met. It added that the strike would also spread to all Toyota plants nationally, over disputes ranging from staff recruitment, bonuses and transport allowances.

* Was arrested on suspicion of illegal painkiller imports* Ex-communications chief unlikely to be charged - Yomiuri* Hamp to be released on Wednesday - media* Firm’s 1st female managing officer stepped down last week (Adds report that Hamp unlikely to be charged)TOKYO, July 7 (Reuters) - Tokyo prosecutors plan to release former Toyota Motor Corp executive Julie Hamp from custody after she was arrested last month on suspicion of illegally importing the painkiller Oxycodone into Japan, Kyodo News reported on Tuesday.Japan’s daily Yomiuri newspaper reported Hamp was unlikely to be charged because prosecutors judged there was little criminal intent in the case, in which a family member had mailed Oxycodone pills to her to alleviate knee pain.Kyodo said Hamp, who resigned from her post as chief communications officer last week three months after her appointment as Toyota’s first female managing officer, is set to be released without indictment on Wednesday, the latest she can be held without a formal charge.A spokeswoman for the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office declined to comment on the report.Citing an unidentified source, the Yomiuri said Hamp had stated that she knew the drug was regulated in Japan, but that she did not consider it an illegal drug.Japanese media reports, citing police investigators, had said that 57 addictive Oxycodone pills were found in a small parcel labelled “necklaces�� that was sent from the United States and addressed to Hamp in Japan. The pills were in packets or buried at the bottom of the parcel, which also contained toy pendants and necklaces, they had said.

(This version of the October 3rd story corrects the name of robotics group in paragraph 8)TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Monday unveiled a doe-eyed palm-sized robot, dubbed Kirobo Mini, designed as a synthetic baby companion in Japan, where plummeting birth rates have left many women childless.Toyota’s non-automotive venture aims to tap a demographic trend that has put Japan at the forefront of aging among the world’s industrial nations, resulting in a population contraction unprecedented for a country not at war, or racked by famine or disease.“He wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which hasn’t fully developed the skills to balance itself,�� said Fuminori Kataoka, Kirobo Mini’s chief design engineer. “This vulnerability is meant to invoke an emotional connection.”Toyota plans to sell Kirobo Mini, which blinks its eyes and speaks with a baby-like high-pitched voice, for 39,800 yen ($392) in Japan next year. It also comes with a “cradle�� that doubles as its baby seat designed to fit in car cup holders.The Toyota baby automaton joins a growing list of companion robots, such as the upcoming Jibo, designed by robotics experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that resembles a swiveling lamp, and Paro, a robot baby seal marketed by Japanese company Intelligent System Co Ltd as a therapeutic machine to soothe elderly dementia sufferers. Around a quarter of Japan’s population is over 65 with a dearth of care workers putting a strain on social services.Exacerbated by a reluctance to invite immigrants to bolster its working-age population, Japan’s demographic crunch shows little sign of easing, with the government looking at robots to replenish the thinning ranks of humans.In the past half century births in Japan have halved to around a million a year, according to government statistics, with one in 10 women never marrying. Births out of wedlock are frowned upon in Japan and much less common than in Western developed nations.Japan is already a leading user of industrial robots. It has the second-biggest concentration after South Korea with 314 machines per 100,000 employees, according to the International Federation of Robotics. New technology to help them better interact with humans means robots have begun moving beyond factory floors into homes, offices, shops and hospitals.Kataoka said Toyota, which is investing heavily to develop artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, sees Kirobo Mini as a stepping stone to more advanced robots that will be able to recognize and react to human emotions.	-1.631094916
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co. GM.N vehicles won eight awards in the annual J.D. Power &amp; Associates survey of initial quality, a marked improvement since the largest American automaker turned itself around after a 2009 bankruptcy.GM cars and trucks won eight top prizes as the best vehicles in their segments of the U.S. auto market in the survey of new vehicle owners.Chevrolet, which accounts for 71 percent of General Motors�� U.S. sales, jumped 10 spots to No. 5 on J.D. Power’s initial quality ratings for 33 brands, the marketing information consultants said on Wednesday.David Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power, said GM has “done an outstanding job�� of working to change the long-held perception that its products were of inferior quality.“GM’s always been good at improving a vehicle once it’s come to market,�� Sargent said in an interview. “What they’re also showing to be pretty good at now is launching vehicles with pretty good quality too.”In the past, Sargent said, GM often introduced new products fraught with problems and then improved those models over time.The J.D. Power survey is in its 27th year. This was the first year that participants could fill out surveys online regarding their experiences in the first 90 days of new-vehicle ownership.The survey was conducted from February to May this year, and all of the vehicles in the survey were 2013 models.This year’s survey was updated to add more consumer feedback on the quality of new technologies, including navigation, lane-departure, telephone, information-entertainment and voice-activated systems.Sargent said that for the overall industry, quality slipped from last year, with the survey results showing more consumer dissatisfaction. That was largely due to expanded inclusion of new technologies in vehicles and consumers having difficulty using many of the new systems.But Sargent added that more complaints were linked to design-related issues rather than a defect or malfunction that could more easily be fixed by dealers than in years past.The best showing by brand, as measured in fewer reported problems per 100 vehicles, was Porsche PSHG_p.DE, the German luxury sports car maker, followed by GM's GMC marque, Toyota Motor Corp.'s 7203.T luxury Lexus brand, Nissan Motor Co.'s 7201.T Infiniti luxury brand and Chevrolet.GMC, which jumped 10 spots in the ratings, and Chevrolet were the top-rated non-luxury brands in the survey.The top 10 was rounded out by Honda Motor Co.'s 7267.T luxury brand Acura, Toyota, Honda, Tata Motor's TAMO.NS luxury Jaguar brand, and Hyundai Motor Co. 005380.KS.The industry average was 113 problems reported per 100 vehicles. All of GM’s brands, including Cadillac and Buick, performed better than the industry average.Non-luxury brands that scored better than the industry average were, in order of finish, GMC, Chevrolet, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia Motors Corp. 000270.KS and Chrysler Group LLC's namesake brand, Chrysler. Chrysler Group is majority owned by Fiat SpA FIA.MI.Ford Motor Co.’s namesake brand remained in 27th place. Sargent said that while the automaker has improved on its touch-screen and voice-command controls, it has also offered its information-entertainment systems on more models, which opened it up for complaints.��(Ford’s) systems themselves are getting better,�� he said.Falling the most spots from a year ago were Nissan’s namesake brand, which dropped 14 places to 30th, and Chrysler’s Ram truck brand, which skidded 14 slots to 28th.Scoring the worst on the survey were the Fiat brand at 32nd and Toyota’s Scion brand at 33rd.Winners of some of the non-luxury best-in-segment awards were the Toyota Camry for midsize cars, Honda Civic for compact cars, Chevrolet Impala for large cars, Chevrolet Silverado for large pickup trucks, Honda CR-V for compact crossover vehicles, Nissan Murano for midsize crossover vehicles, and Chrysler Town &amp; Country for minivan.For more details on the study, go to www.jdpower.com/quality.	11.31043909
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine unit of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp expects a 17-percent decrease in its output this year as higher excise taxes and consumer goods prices weigh on demand, its president said on Wednesday.The Philippines, one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, is Toyota’s ninth largest market worldwide.“The market has slowed down not only because of the impact of the excise tax increase, but also inflation having an impact on car customers,�� Toyota Motor Philippines Corp President Satoru Suzuki told reporters.Toyota Philippines will produce around 50,000 units this year, down nearly 17 percent from the record high 60,000 units in 2017, Suzuki said.Toyota Philippines, the country’s top car manufacturer and seller, assembles Vios and Innova models in its facility south of the capital.The Philippines�� car production, the second smallest in Southeast Asia, is less than a tenth of the output of top manufacturers Thailand and Indonesia.Sales of motor vehicles among all automotive companies in the Philippines fell 12.5 percent to 171,590 units in the first half from a year ago, data from the ASEAN Automotive Federation showed. It is the second largest sales decline in the region, next only to Singapore’s 13.3-percent drop.Car distributors attribute flagging sales to new excise taxes on automobiles that started this year and higher consumer prices, including oil.“Our market now, I think, I can say, is very bad,�� Suzuki said.But sales and production will likely recover next year as the Philippine economy continues its expansion, he said.Toyota Philippines is a joint venture of Toyota and Philippine conglomerate GT Capital Holdings Inc.	-6.898130485
NEW YORK, March 25 (LPC) - General Motors Co (GM) is managing a delicate balancing act as it readies to draw down US$16bn in loans while refinancing debt of similar size, facing a longer than expected shutdown of its plants and considerable revenue losses.The automaker gave notice to its lenders that it would borrow an existing credit facility almost in its entirety on Tuesday.But the decision to draw down on its facilities comes as the company is undergoing its customary refinancing discussions for US$16.5bn in debt led by JP Morgan.GM is on a rocky road as it readies to suffer a significant revenue loss due to the shutdown of its North American plants that could extend beyond March 30.On Wednesday, Moody’s Investors Service announced it could downgrade GM’s Baa2 bank credit facility rating and its Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating into junk territory.“A severe disruption in automotive demand due to the coronavirus combined with the possibility of a follow-on economic recession, will place considerable pressure on GM’s cash flow and credit metrics,�� Moody’s said in a report.GM said it expects to borrow amounts on its revolver as a proactive measure to shore up liquidity and strengthen its financial position due to global market uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The company and its lead banks are currently debating the best outcome for both parties through a crisis of unprecedented magnitude that has created a playing field that is much different from the one in which lenders originally committed to lend.On Wednesday, Congress reached an agreement on a US$2trn economic stimulus bill to alleviate the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The much-anticipated spending bill does not make specific mention of automakers, but sets aside US$454bn to make loans or loan guarantees for companies across all sectors, according to Reuters.“They want to show liquidity,�� a banking source said. “In order to qualify for the government bailout you need to keep your employees on the payroll.”Companies use revolving credit facilities, known as revolvers, as backstop financing in case short-term commercial paper lines that cover for expenses such as payroll fail to roll over. Borrowers can draw down, repay, and re-borrow these funding lines at will. For the most part, these facilities pay low rates and remain undrawn.But as the coronavirus crisis intensifies in the US, more and more corporations are drawing down on their facilities to strengthen their liquidity position in case cash dries out.“You have made a commitment to a company that you don’t know how it’s going to look like in three months, six months,�� the banking source said. “Every company is now a different company. This situation is unprecedented. It’s a game changer for the entire market.”GM could go ahead with the transaction as it was originally offered, reduce the overall size of the financing, or address only near-term maturities, three banking sources said.The company has two upcoming maturities, including a US$4bn, three-year loan and a US$2bn, 364-day loan, both set to mature in April 2021, according to a second filing with the SEC.GM may ultimately decide to put the refinancing on hold, the three banking sources said.The car maker also has a US$10.5bn credit facility that matures in April 2023.The debt refinancing was meant to extend maturities, but leave pricing unchanged. It’s an exercise the car maker performs every two years, according to bankers.The deadline for commitments was Wednesday. Target closing for the financing is mid-April, the banking sources said.GM drew down on its revolving line of credit to ensure it had access to those funds during this uncertain situation, a GM spokesperson said in an email.The company, which prior to the draw was projected to have between US$15bn-US$16bn of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the quarter, did not have any immediate cash needs when it made the decision, the spokesperson said in the email.A JP Morgan spokesperson declined to comment.GM’s decision to borrow as early as Friday comes on the heels of a similar choice by rival Ford Motor Co that canceled a debt refinancing transaction after it also announced plans to draw down on its credit facility, two banking sources said.In February, Ford also asked its JP Morgan-led bank group to refinance US$15.4bn in revolving credits but in March decided to draw down on the facility and postponed its refinancing plans as market conditions deteriorated, two banking sources said.Ford drew US$13.4bn under its corporate credit facility and US$2bn under its supplemental credit facility, for a total of US$15.4bn. The borrowings will be used to “offset the temporary working capital impacts of the coronavirus-related production shutdowns and to preserve Ford’s financial flexibility,�� according to a March 19 Ford press release.Ford has said it would revisit its refinancing plans as early as September, two banking sources said. GM could decide to do the same, they said.On Wednesday, Moody’s downgraded Ford further into junk territory, cutting the company’s rating to Ba2, from Ba1, citing “the severe shock of the coronavirus pandemic combined with Ford’s already-weak operating performance and a years-long restructuring that is a drain on cash flow.”Also on Wednesady, S&amp;P Global downgraded the company’s credit rating into junk, lowering its long-term issuer credit rating to BB+ from BBB-.Fitch on Monday cut Ford’s credit rating one notch to BBB- with a negative outlook.A Ford spokesperson referred questions to the March 19 news release.Due to its reliance on international supply chains, automakers were one of the sectors expected to be hit hardest by coronavirus.Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said March 18 they would shut down their North American plants to stop the spread of the virus, as they bowed to pressure from the union representing about 150,000 hourly workers at those facilities, Reuters reported.On Monday, trade groups representing automakers including GM, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp said in a letter to congressional leadership that the US Congress should set up facilities to provide loans and loan guarantees to large employers, medium-size manufacturers and small businesses facing revenue losses due to COVID-19. The trade groups expect retail sales to be down by as much as 40% in March compared to the same month in 2019.GM and Ford join a list of companies that have funded their credit lines in order to boost liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Lenders have been acquiescing to the borrowing requests so far.GM’s 364-day loan pays 12.5bp undrawn, the three-year pays 15bp undrawn and the five-year pays 17.5bp.The drawn margin on the three facilities is 125bp over Libor.GM has a separate US$3bn, three-year revolving credit line that is not part of the refinancing effort.As of December 31, GM had US$17.3bn in cash available under credit facilities and total available liquidity of US$37.2bn, according to the second SEC filing.

(Adds source in headline)Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japanese trading company Mitsui &amp; Co bought Brazil’s Veloce Logistica SA for 4.7 billion yen ($58.5 million) to expand into the South American country’s auto parts distribution business, the Nikkei said.Veloce Logistica manages parts transportation, runs distribution centers and handles deliveries in Brazil and Argentina for local plants of General Motors Co and other major automakers, the business daily said.Mitsui bought the third-ranked Brazilian player, which employs about 500 people and generates sales of about 9 billion yen, from a local private equity firm and other investors, the Nikkei said.Mitsui has been running auto parts distribution in the U.S., Europe and Asia for Toyota Motor Corp, the paper said.In Brazil, Mitsui expects to tap demand from Japanese car makers including Honda Motor Co Ltd and European rivals like Renault SA and Volkswagen AG, the daily reported.Mitsui also expects to boost transportation efficiency by shipping consumer good for local units of Unilever NV, Nestle SA and others on the way back from delivering autoparts, the Nikkei said.

TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s warning it could rethink further investment plans in Thailand looks aimed at signalling its deep frustration over a drawn-out political crisis, but Japanese car makers are unlikely to scale back Thai operations any time soon.Until recently the likes of Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co have said mostly that anti-government protests in Bangkok, now in their third month, were having little impact on their local bases.But Toyota has broken ranks, with the head of the company’s Thai subsidiary saying on Monday it may reconsider a planned investment of up to $609 million, and could even cut production, if the unrest drags on.“Japanese companies have continued to invest in Thailand even in the face of big floods and past political turmoil,�� a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.“Regardless of what might happen with investments there, the message was an alarm bell.”The Thai government said on Tuesday it would impose a 60-day state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding provinces as it attempts to contain a protest movement that has blockaded parts of the capital and is seeking the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.Auto manufacturing is Thailand’s third-largest industry, accounting for more than 10 percent of gross domestic product, with an annual output of around 2.5 million vehicles that has seen it dubbed the “Detroit of the East��.Japanese car makers have been investing in Thailand for decades and have come to rely on the country as an export hub. They also control around 80 percent of the Thai car market, the biggest in Southeast Asia.In the short-term Japanese car makers are unlikely to shift production elsewhere given the country’s crucial position in their global manufacturing strategy.Toyota makes about one-in-10 of its cars in Thailand and plans to invest around 20 billion baht ($609 million) to boost annual capacity by 200,000 vehicles over the next three or four years, to 1 million vehicles.Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp have each positioned Thailand as a hub to manufacture small cars, exporting them not only to neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia but also to Japan.But the current political woes could spur car makers to diversify their manufacturing base over the longer term, said Shingo Ikeda, a principal at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, Southeast Asia.Indonesia, with roughly four times the population, is expected to surpass Thailand as the region’s biggest auto market in the next few years, and would be the most likely alternative, since Japanese automakers already make cars there and labour costs are relatively low.“Unlike in the past when it was single-handedly dependent on Thailand, Toyota has more leeway to shift to Indonesia the production capacity that it plans to add to Thailand,�� said Ryuichiro Inoue, a professor at Tokyo City University and an auto industry expert.For example, Toyota theoretically could shift production of its multi-purpose vehicle series called IMV, developed as global models with similar structure and parts, from Thailand to Indonesia relatively easily.But any such shift would not happen quickly. Given the hefty investments that car makers have made into Thailand, the country will remain a dominant manufacturing site for the time being, helped by a strong supplier network and highly trained workers.For now, Japanese car makers other than Toyota say they will be sticking with their investment plans in Thailand.“There is no change in our stance of continuing to position Thailand as one of our key overseas manufacturing sites,�� Mazda spokeswoman Misato Kobayashi said.Nissan is investing 11 billion Thai baht ($335 million) in its second Thai plant, which will start operating by end-March. Honda is also building a second car plant there with an investment of 17.2 billion baht and a start-up target of 2015. Mazda is building a $250 million transmission plant.

(Adds dropped word to second paragraph)* Nissan China JV with Dongfeng Motor to produce 2 Infiniti models* Local China production “a necessity�� for sales expansion - exec* Infiniti decision puts pressure on Toyota, HondaBy Chang-Ran KimTOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Friday that it will start building vehicles under its premium Infiniti brand in China from 2014 as Japan’s No.2 automaker aims to challenge the dominance of German rivals in the world’s largest car market.The move to produce Infiniti models in China, where tariffs of 25 percent put imported vehicles at a disadvantage, should put Nissan on a better footing to compete with market leaders Audi AG, Mercedes Benz maker Daimler AG and BMW AG, which all produce locally.Nissan said in a statement that it would build two yet-to-be-identified Infiniti models at factories operated by its joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd. It did not provide sales or production targets.Under a mid-term growth plan, Nissan is targeting sales of 500,000 Infiniti vehicles globally by 2016, and has said China would account for a chunk of that growth.“For the brand to reach its aggressive sales target ... local production in the world’s largest automobile market is not an option but a necessity to our success,�� Andy Palmer, head of Infiniti operations, said in a statement.Nissan sold about 146,000 Infiniti vehicles globally, mostly in the United States, in the business year ended March 2011. In China, Infiniti sold just 16,126 cars last calendar year, a fraction of the more than 300,000 sold by Audi, Volkswagen AG’s premium brand.Nissan’s decision cranks up pressure on Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, which are also looking to catapult sales of their premium Lexus and Acura brands globally, but have given no indication they plan to produce those cars in China.

* U.S. June auto sales rose 3.9 percent from year ago-Wards* GM, Ford, Toyota report drop in car sales, rise in SUV sales* Ford, GM gain in prices commanded for SUVs, trucks* Jeep sales up 25 percent in June (Adds final auto sales figure, updates share prices, adds Hyundai-Kia sales)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, July 1 (Reuters) - Strong demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks in June helped General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co offset slowing demand for sedans by allowing them to raise prices on their trucks.GM and Ford said on Wednesday increases in the average transaction prices for their vehicles, particularly trucks and SUVs, outpaced sales volume growth that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Ford, for example, said prices for its F-series trucks rose 8 percent, or $3,600, while sales volume for the pickup truck line dropped 8.9 percent in June.U.S. June auto industry sales rose to about 1.47 million vehicles, up 3.9 percent from a year ago, according to figures compiled by WardsAuto.GM’s sales fell 3 percent last month as the company’s small cars slid from year-ago figures, including a 13 percent drop in Cruze compact sales. Sales of GM’s large SUVs also fell, reflecting fewer sales to fleets, a company spokesman said. But GM said average transaction prices for all vehicles rose almost $1,000 from a year earlier.GM said analysts may have not factored into their expectations the automaker’s statement a month ago that its sales to rental agencies would fall by 20,000 vehicles in June.Earlier this week, car shopping and industry consultant TrueCar Inc said June would bring in about $48 billion of net revenue, up 7.3 percent from a year ago. TrueCar said the sharpest rises in net revenue from a year ago would come from Nissan Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles .GM shares were down 1.1 percent at $32.97 late on Wednesday afternoon. Ford shares were down 0.4 percent at $14.95.The National Automobile Dealers Association this week raised its forecast for 2015 U.S. auto sales to 17.2 million vehicles from 16.9 million. It would be the sixth straight year of solid gains since the recession.While Ford’s sales rose only 2 percent, it showed the largest increase in the market in the average price of its vehicles, industry consultant Kelley Blue Book said.Ford’s SUV sales rose 10 percent, but car sales fell 3.5 percent.Toyota, No. 3 in the U.S market by sales, posted June sales of nearly 210,000 vehicles, up 4 percent, roughly in line with expectations.Honda Motor Co showed sales of about 134,000 vehicles, up 4 percent from a year ago, on strong SUV sales.Fiat Chrysler U.S. June auto sales increased 8 percent from a year ago, boosted by the continued strength of its Jeep SUV brand.Nissan U.S. sales rose 13 percent, led by a 54 percent increase in its popular Rogue small SUV.Corporate teammates Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp collectively sold 121,639 vehicles in June, up 3 percent from a year ago.

Excluding 660cc minivehicles, sales surged 41 percent to 263,267 vehicles, marking the biggest rise on record for the month of January, albeit from a historically low base.“The tax incentives and subsidies helped a lot,�� said Michiro Saito, an official at the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. “New model launches and environmentally friendly cars like Toyota’s Aqua and Prius and Honda’s Fit are doing particularly well.”Tokyo’s incentives especially favour hybrids, pure electric cars and other vehicles that employ advanced technology such as clean diesel engines, benefiting hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co.Toyota said on Wednesday its new hybrid Aqua compact received 120,000 orders in the first month of sales, equivalent to 10 times the monthly sales target. The Aqua, called Prius C overseas, is the world’s cheapest and most fuel-efficient hybrid to date, starting at 1.69 million yen ($22,200) with listed mileage of 35.4 km/litre in Japan.Toyota’s domestic sales in January grew 46 percent. Nissan Motor Co saw a 36 percent rise, excluding minivehicles, while Honda’s soared 59 percent, with hybrids now accounting for about half of the brand’s non-mini domestic sales.Japanese automakers are bracing for a bumper year globally in 2012 after supply disruptions caused by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami dragged them down last year.The industry has forecast a 19 percent rise in new vehicle sales in 2012, also on demand from tsunami-hit areas where thousands of cars were destroyed. It hopes the government’s initiative will boost sales by about 900,000 vehicles in the business year from April.Still, car sales are on a longer-term downtrend in Japan, where the population is shrinking, urbanisation is rising, and city-dwellers mainly rely on public transportation.In contrast, all five South Korean car makers except Ssangyong Motor posted double-digit falls in domestic sales last month, citing the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February last year.Car sales are expected to dip this year due to South Korea’s slowing economy and competition could heat up as its free trade deal with the United States takes effect early this year.Hyundai Motor Co’s domestic sales fell 18.5 percent, while brisk overseas sales helped eke out a 3.5 percent rise globally.“Fewer working days is the biggest reason for the sales drops in January,�� said Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at NH Investment &amp; Securities.“Hyundai’s sales from its plants in India, the United States and Czech Republic rose by double-digit percentages, whereas China factory sales fell because of Lunar New Year holidays,�� he said.Sister company Kia Motors Corp’s monthly sales fell for the first time in nearly three years, dragged down by a 15.5 percent drop in sales at home.“The sales outlook of Kia is not bright this year as domestic sales are seen declining 1.1 percent, global auto market growth is seen slowing and overseas rivals are stepping up competition,�� Kia said in a statement.Hyundai and Kia last month reported smaller-than-expected quarterly profits and said they expect growth in their global sales volume this year to halve to 5.7 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively.In India, top carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd reported its first monthly sales rise since May 2011, driven mainly by export growth as it completed its recovery from production-crippling strikes last summer.Maruti said sales rose 5.2 percent in January with exports soaring 54.3 percent. Domestic sales inched up 0.6 percent as demand slows down in Asia’s third-largest economy due to high interest rates and rising fuel costs.Local rival Tata Motors said sales of its passenger cars rose 14 percent in January, while Mahindra &amp; Mahindra the leader in the SUV segment, said its sales were up 22 percent.Maruti, 54.2 percent owned by Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp , had said it expected its factories to be back at full capacity by January after losing $500 million worth of production last summer due to labour unrest.The carmaker expects sales in the financial year that ends in March to be 11 percent lower than in the previous year, an executive said on Wednesday.Car sales in India are seen growing just 0-2 percent in the financial year that ends in March, an industry body said this month, but will likely rebound later in 2012 with an easing of interest rates.	6.572215663
NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has been found liable in an unintended acceleration lawsuit in the U.S., one of the first such cases to go to trial since the Japanese carmaker began recalling millions of vehicles in 2009 over acceleration issues.A jury in Oklahoma on Thursday awarded $3 million in compensatory damages to Jean Bookout, a driver injured in a 2007 crash, and the family of Barbara Schwarz, who was killed.The lawsuit claimed defects caused Bookout’s 2005 Camry to accelerate unexpectedly, leading to the crash. Deliberations will resume on Friday to determine punitive damages.The case, one of hundreds brought by individuals across the country claiming that their Toyota vehicles accelerated without warning, is the first to result in a verdict against the carmaker.In two previous cases to reach trial, one in California and one in New York, juries found in Toyota’s favor.Toyota representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to comment, citing a gag order imposed by the judge.There have been approximately 200 proposed class actions and more than 500 individual cases filed against Toyota since February 2009 over the alleged acceleration issues, according to a recent company regulatory filing.The Oklahoma lawsuit claimed the Camry accelerated suddenly on Sept. 20, 2007, while Bookout was driving along an interstate highway and that applying both the brake and the emergency brake did nothing to slow it down.The 2005 Camry model was not included in the acceleration-related recalls.Toyota has already agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle class-action claims from owners over economic losses suffered because of the alleged defects. But that deal did not cover individual injury and wrongful death lawsuits.	-2.401118968
TOKYO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average edged lower on Thursday morning, hit by declines in automakers and electronic component makers as the strong yen soured investor appetite.The Nikkei shed 0.4 percent to 23,705.47 in midmorning trade, after hitting as low as 23,601.84.Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.4 percent, Honda Motor Co tumbled 2.0 percent and Mazda Motor shed 0.6 percent.The yen has risen this week after the Bank of Japan on Tuesday trimmed its buying of long-dated Japanese government bonds in market operations. Early in the day, the dollar suffered its biggest one-day drop in nearly eight months against the yen following a report that China was ready to slow or halt its purchases of U.S. Treasuries, before regaining some ground later.Kyocera Corp fell 1.4 percent, Alps Electric declined 1.7 percent and Taiyo Yuden stumbled 2.3 percent.Banks continued to advance, however, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rising 0.4 percent and Mizuho Financial Group gaining 0.7 percent.The broader Topix dropped 0.4 percent to 1,883.96.	1.351252648
* Companies to hold news conference this week - Nikkei* Follows deal for BMW to supply diesel engines to Toyota* BMW’s hybrid venture with PSA has been thrown in doubtTOKYO, June 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to supply hybrid technology to BMW AG, deepening a partnership that began with a deal last December on diesel engines and electric car batteries, the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday.This month, BMW’s joint venture to make hybrid car components with French auto maker PSA Peugeot Citroen was thrown into doubt by the prospect of deepening ties between PSA and its European rival Opel, a division of General Motors .Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota, and Norbert Reithofer, chief executive of BMW, plan to hold a news conference in Germany this week to announce the new project, the paper said without citing sources.Toyota was not immediately available for comment.In December, the German premium car maker agreed to supply diesel engines to Toyota from 2014 in Europe and collaborate on lithium-ion battery research for electric cars.Global automakers face ballooning research and development costs to meet tougher emissions and fuel-economy standards around the world.This has accelerated cooperation deals among car makers, including Toyota and BMW’s main rivals, Nissan Motor Co and Daimler AG, along with Nissan’s French partner, Renault SA.	-4.704954659
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Tuesday said it would begin testing its hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV) in the United Arab Emirates as the Japanese automaker explores the potential for the zero-emissions fuel technology in hot, dry conditions.Toyota will team up with Abu Dhabi green energy firm Masdar, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co [ADNOC.UL] and French industrial gases company Air Liquide SA AIRP.PA to examine prospects for hydrogen production, logistics and business feasibility.As part of the project Toyota will conduct driving and refueling tests using its Mirai FCV, which it launched in late 2015 as part of its goal to foster what it calls a “hydrogen society��, where the zero-emission fuel would power homes and vehicles.“As the (UAE) government continues to promote new initiatives and pursues the creation of a hydrogen-based society, the UAE is able to emerge as the world leader of next-generation clean energies,�� Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada said in a statement.Toyota has promoted fuel cell vehicles as the most viable next-generation option to petrol-electric hybrids, but a lack of hydrogen fuelling stations poses a major hurdle for mass consumption.	-4.284872464
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp said on Wednesday they will build a $1.6 billion joint assembly plant in Alabama that will employ up to 4,000 workers, a boost for President Donald Trump, who wants automakers to expand U.S. production.Toyota President Akio Toyoda and Mazda Chief Executive Officer Masamichi Kogai joined Alabama Governor Kay Ivey in Montgomery at an event to announce the decision.“Welcome to sweet home Alabama,�� Ivey said to the two executives, after saying the anticipated 4,000 workers at the plant to be built in Huntsville would earn an average of $50,000 a year.The plant will produce 300,000 vehicles a year and should open on a 2,500-acre former cotton field in 2021, about 14 miles from Toyota’s engine plant in Huntsville.Trump tweeted Wednesday night that the announcement was “Good news�� for the U.S. economy.“Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!�� he wrote.Toyota plans to build Corolla cars at the plant, while Mazda will build crossover SUVs.Alabama will provide tax incentives. Officials said the state tax incentives were worth $370 million, but they did not disclose how much the local incentives were worth.But with U.S. auto industry sales declining, the new plant could exacerbate overcapacity and add pressure to cut prices. U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017, after hitting a record high in 2016, and are expected to fall further in 2018.Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said the plant will “provide jobs for decades to come for Huntsville and Alabama. It vaults Alabama to the top as an industry leader in producing the next generation of cars that will power our nation.”Among U.S. states, Alabama is already the fifth largest producer of cars and light trucks. The state has more than 150 major auto suppliers and 57,000 automotive manufacturing jobs.Two decades ago, Alabama spent an estimated $250 million to woo Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz to put an auto plant in Tuscaloosa, sparking the birth of auto production in the state.In September, Daimler said it would invest $1 billion to expand its Alabama Mercedes-Benz plant to start building electric sport-utility vehicles there from about 2020.Alabama is also home to assembly plants operated by Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co. A Kia Motors Corp assembly plant operates near the Alabama border in Georgia.Mazda and Toyota said they still need approvals and authorization by antitrust agencies for the new joint venture. They announced a capital alliance in August and plan to jointly develop technology for electric vehicles.Trump tweeted in March that he wanted “new plants to be built here for cars sold here.�� Many automakers have announced expansions of facilities or new jobs but no other new U.S. auto plants have been announced.A year ago, shortly before his inauguration, Trump criticized Toyota and threatened hefty tariffs against the Japanese automaker if it built its Corolla sedan for the U.S. market in Mexico.In announcing plans for a new plant in August, Toyota said it would shift production of Corollas from Canada to the new venture rather than in Guanajuato and would build Tacoma pickups in Mexico instead.Toyota North America chief executive Jim Lentz said in an interview on Wednesday that pressure from Trump was not a factor in the decision to build the plant. “These plants are going to live 30, 50 years plus and we have to make good business decisions,�� he said.Lentz said it makes sense to build Corollas because Toyota needs the volume even in a declining car market. He called the $800 million investment a “bargain�� to get the additional volume.Toyota hopes to break ground this spring after initially getting more than 100 proposed sites from 22 states.In October, Toyota said it would scale back investment in a planned plant in Mexico by 30 percent to $700 million and cut planned annual capacity in half to 100,000 vehicles as it shuffles its production plans to meet market demands.Over the last 30 years Toyota and other automakers from Germany and other parts of Asia have built a second auto industry in the United States. Its size and employment rivals operations of the Detroit Three automakers, but with newer plants and fewer unionized workers.U.S. states covet auto assembly plants because they typically pay above-average wages and spin off jobs at suppliers and service companies. Southern states have been home to the majority of new auto production by German and Asian automakers. These states generally have good transportation infrastructure, business-friendly regulators and anti-union politicians.	1.351252648
BEIJING (Reuters) - Vehicles sales in China, the world’s largest auto market, fell 14.6% in April from the same month a year earlier, the country’s biggest auto industry association said on Monday, marking the 10th consecutive month of decline.Sales fell to 1.98 million vehicles, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).That followed declines of 5.2 percent in March and 14 percent in February, as well as the first annual contraction last year since the 1990s against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a crippling trade war with the United States.GRAPHIC: China car sales on the slide - tmsnrt.rs/2W3L5tAAutomakers have been lowering prices in China after the government introduced tax cuts to spur consumer spending. CAAM officials said customers were nevertheless holding off purchases in the hope of more favorable policies, hurting sales.April’s sales also suffered from some Chinese provinces implementing new vehicle emission standards earlier than expected, which stoked uncertainty among manufacturers, according to CAAM, analysts, dealers and consumers.The government will require all light vehicles to adhere to tougher “China VI�� emission standards by 2020 as part of efforts to combat pollution.In line with that, sales of new energy vehicles (NEV) have been a bright spot, rising 18.1% in April to 97,000 vehicles, CAAM said. NEV sales jumped almost 62 percent last year even as the broader auto market contracted.While overall auto sales are declining, Toyota Motor Corp reported around 20% growth last month with the help of revamped models of both its Toyota- and Lexus-branded models.Conversely, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, a Chinese partner of Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co, said group sales fell 16.8% last month.“Japanese car makers have products that are better prepared for a switch in emission standard. At the same time they are offering more affordable products,�� CAAM’s Xu said.Xu said recent escalation in the trade war between China and the United States, which has seen the U.S. raise import tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, is likely to have significant impact on China’s exports of car parts.Senior automotive executives attending the Shanghai autoshow last month said China’s auto market will likely return to growth in the second half of this year due to government support. They nevertheless said the days of high single- or double-digit growth were over and that industry consolidation was likely.	6.274310841
(Adds details)BANGKOK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Thailand’s industry-wide auto sales could fall as much 15 percent in 2015 and mark a third consecutive year of sales declines, according to Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit.Toyota had initially forecast auto sales would rise 4.3 percent this year to around 920,000 vehicles but lowered that estimate to 800,000 in July before cutting it again on Monday to between 750,000 and 760,000 vehicles.“The domestic economy has been (a problem) for us for a while. However, the global economy has been worse than expected and has had an impact on this market,�� Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Thai unit, told reporters.In 2014, industry-wide domestic auto sales tumbled 33.7 percent to 881,832 vehicles, hit by political unrest including a May coup by the army that year. In 2013, sales fell after a government subsidy scheme for first-time car buyers ended.Toyota, which commands about a third of the Thai market, cut its own sales target to 265,000 units in 2015 from 280,000 vehicles projected in July and 330,000 projected in January.Last month, Thailand’s central bank cut its 2015 economic growth forecast to 2.7 percent from 3.0 percent due to weakness in exports.

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor’s Lexus brand of luxury vehicles was the most dependable name for the eighth consecutive year, while Fiat Chrysler’s Fiat brand dropped to the bottom in an annual auto industry reliability survey published Wednesday.Industry consultant J.D. Power’s closely watched study measures the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles during the past 12 months by original owners of 2016 model-year vehicles, with a lower score reflecting higher quality and dependability.Lexus had a score of 106 problems per hundred, the 2019 U.S. vehicle dependability study showed. Porsche and Toyota ranked second, with a score of 108 each.Overall, the study showed a 4 percent improvement in vehicle dependability from 2018.“Vehicles are more reliable than ever, but automakers are wrestling with problems such as voice recognition, transmission shifts and battery failures,�� said Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power.Chrysler, which was at the bottom of the survey that covered 31 brands in 2018, improved its ranking in 2019 to 16, but Fiat slipped by two ranks to the last position.(Graphic: U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study - tmsnrt.rs/2TNThKg)General Motors Co topped in five of the 20 categories, while Toyota Motor Corp got the top rank in four.The study is based on responses from 32,952 original owners of 2016 model-year vehicles after three years of ownership.	0.2180293501
* Japan, China, Europe, Mexico, other regions affected* Recall covers passenger-side air bags without drying agent* Affected models include Lexus IS, GX, Toyota 4Runner, Corolla (Adds details on models affected)TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday said it was recalling a total of about 490,000 vehicles in Japan, China, Europe and other regions over potentially faulty air bag inflators produced by Takata Corp, further widening a massive global recall.Automakers are ramping up recalls of Takata air bag inflators after the auto parts maker, under pressure from the U.S. government, agreed last month to declare more of its airbags as defective in the United States.Toyota’s latest recall covers passenger-side airbags produced by Takata which use ammonium nitrate to inflate the air bag, and do not contain a drying agent. These have been found to explode with excessive force in hot, humid conditions, and have been linked to more than 100 injuries and 13 deaths worldwide, mainly in the United States.Toyota is recalling around 45,000 Lexus IS model vehicles produced between 2005 and 2011 for the Japanese market, and will withdraw a total of around 140,000 Lexus IS, ES, and GX models from roughly the same production period which were marketed in China.The same Lexus models will be recalled in Europe, along with Toyota 4Runner SUVs and Corolla compact models, making up a total of 80,000 vehicles also produced around 2005-2011.In Mexico, Toyota is recalling 100,000 vehicles including Corollas, Sienna minivans, and the Yaris subcompact model, while a total of 120,000 vehicles from both brands will be withdrawn in South America and other regions, the company said.Facing ballooning recall costs and lawsuits over its faulty airbags, the embattled parts maker is in bailout talks with a number of potential investors including private equity firm KKR &amp; Co, Reuters reported last week.Last week, automakers recalled more than 12 million vehicles in the United States over potentially defective Takata air bag inflators. Toyota has recalled more than 17 million Takata air bags globally since recalls began in 2008. (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Richard Pullin)	-4.469273743
* 2015 car exports seen at 1.2 mln cars, higher in 2016-federation* Govt banking on auto exports to help broader economy, exports* Domestic car sales seen down in 2015 for third straight yearBANGKOK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Thailand’s auto exports are set to hit a record this year, good news for an industry bogged down by weak domestic demand and an economy struggling to recover after 18 months of military rule.The government is hopeful that stronger momentum in the sector - accounting for around 10 percent of GDP and employing a tenth of its workers in manufacturing - will lift economic growth that was just 0.9 percent last year.Cars, parts and accessories, Thailand’s biggest export category, rose an annual 3.9 percent in the first 10 months of the year, Commerce Ministry data showed this week, even as total exports contracted 5.3 percent over the same period.“We believe this export business will now become more important for Thailand in view of the current economic situation in the country, and due to the opportunities created by free-trade measures,�� said Noriaki Abe, president and CEO of Asian Honda Motor Co, the Bangkok-based arm of the Japanese automaker.The popularity of pick-up trucks in Asia, more demand from top buyer Australia and the launch of new and affordable car models, have helped Thai car exports, industry executives say.Known as the “Detroit of Southeast Asia��, Thailand is a regional base for some of the world’s top carmakers, including Toyota Motor Co and Honda Motor Co.The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) said it expects exports of completely built units (CBU) to rise by 6.4 percent to a record 1.2 million this year and 1.22 million next year.Toyota has a target of 390,000 cars for exports this year and 265,000 for domestic sales; Isuzu says its exports should reach a record 102,000 cars, up from 88,000 last year.“Our exports are getting better by day, by night,�� said Panatda Chennavasin, a senior vice president of Tri Petch Isuzu Sales.Honda has already exceeded last year’s exports of 52,565 cars, and aims to export a record 72,700 cars in 2015, said Pitak Pruittisarikorn, chief operating officer of Honda Automobile (Thailand).“A more favourable external environment should play out for Thailand in 2016, especially as some greenshoot recovery is observed from the strong auto exports this year,�� said Barnabas Gan, an economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.While auto shipments are improving, weak global demand has exacerbated a long-term decline in some of Thailand’s other export sectors. Total shipments are forecast to fall 5 percent this year - a third straight year of decline.Record-high household debt, including some built up under a first-car subsidy scheme, has hurt spending in Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy under military rule since May 2014.The subsidy scheme saw sales boom 81 percent in 2012. But in the aftermath of the scheme, sales have fallen on an annual basis every month since May 2013.The government expects the economy will grow between 3 and 4 percent next year, with exports rising 3 percent, and the auto sector is a pivotal factor in those projections.“Auto exports are expected to grow strongly into the first quarter of next year. They will be key to help lift confidence in the economy,�� said Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak.	0.08040524242
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s return to selling smaller pickups in the United States has resuscitated a moribund market segment, but new data highlights the risk that the automaker’s new trucks are cannibalizing sales of higher-priced models.Since the launch last autumn of the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, the midsize pickup segment has grown to more than 2 percent of the total U.S. car and light truck market from 1.4 percent last summer. Some industry executives believe the segment could double annual sales to 500,000 vehicles, which would have been 3 percent of last year’s market.However, beneath the encouraging numbers for the Colorado and Canyon are some less positive trends, said IHS Automotive analyst Tom Libby. Nine of the top 10 vehicles previously owned by buyers of the Colorado and Canyon are GM cars and trucks.Owners of full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks made up more than 16 percent of the consumers who switched into both smaller GM pickups, according to IHS data.“That was ominous,�� Libby said. “There may be a deeper issue here�� related to the potential for undercutting sales of higher-margin models.Libby said it was early in the life of the new midsized trucks and the actual number of consumers who switched from other GM vehicles was small by comparison.GM officials said the IHS data fails to take into account new buyers and Canyon marketing manager Kenn Bakowski said more than half of all the sales of the new trucks are buyers new to the company.GM’s new trucks have taken a bite out of long-time midsized pickup segment leader, Toyota Motor Corp’s Tacoma. Last month, GM President Dan Ammann called the smaller trucks “a very good investment.”�It’s a sleeper segment with huge opportunity,�� Rich Latek, GMC’s director of marketing, said in an interview. GM recently added a third shift at the Wentzville, Missouri, plant where their trucks are built because demand is so strong. The automaker plans to offer a diesel version to expand the appeal of the models.The Colorado and Canyon represent one leg of what GM executives call a “three-truck strategy.�� The other two are the large and heavy-duty versions of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which are bigger and sell at higher prices.The Colorado and Canyon, like the Toyota Tacoma, are aimed at people who want the utility of a pickup, but more for recreation - such as carrying bikes or camping gear - than for hauling lumber or oil field gear. The Colorado starts at about $20,120, about $6,000 less than the larger Silverado pickup.Dealers say they are happy with the new trucks. “It’s the right truck at the right time,�� AutoNation Inc Chief Executive Mike Jackson said. “They saw something that others doubted.”Still, it is not clear that demand will soon surpass the 1986 peak, when smaller pickups made up more than 9 percent of the market with more than 1.4 million sales, according to GM.Midsized trucks generate less than the $10,000-$12,000 in profit per vehicle of the full-size models according to analysts, but GM officials said they are money-makers and a component of their strategy to achieve 10 percent profit margins in North America. Since their launch last fall, GM has sold 37,351 Colorado and Canyon trucks through March.Demand for larger pickups remains much greater, however. Chevrolet sold 45,193 Silverados in March alone.LMC Automotive sees the midsize segment hitting 2 percent of the overall market this year but slipping back under that by 2020. LMC forecasts Colorado sales to hit just over 74,000 this year but to fall by 8.4 percent over the next five years, and Canyon sales to hit almost 29,500 this year but slide almost 21 percent in the subsequent five years.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Matthew Stover said GM’s smaller trucks will generate decent profit, but the smaller trucks are more significant for Latin America and Asia.“Too many other products have emerged in the market to fill the place of the midsized pickup truck,�� Stover said.Toyota, meanwhile, is gearing up to defend its position in the United States with a redesigned Tacoma due to launch this fall. The Tacoma has lost share in the segment, but its sales are still up almost 13 percent so far this year.“Our biggest issue right now is trying to keep our dealers supplied,�� said Bill Fay, group vice president for Toyota’s U.S. sales. Toyota added a third shift at its truck plant in Baja, Mexico.Fay predicts the midsized truck segment could rise as high as 500,000 U.S. sales, which would be double last year’s level. Tacoma sales could improve by more than 6 percent this year to about 165,000 trucks, he said, and rise another 10,000 or more next year.And the segment will likely grow more crowded. Hyundai Motor Co is eyeing the smaller end of the market, and Daimler’s Mercedes has said it will focus initially on non-U.S. markets.However, GM’s U.S. rivals - Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - are still unconvinced of the viability of smaller trucks.“We are investing in and expanding our F-Series lineup for the North American market,�� Doug Scott, Ford Truck group marketing manager, said of the company’s full-size truck. “The compact pickup segment in the U.S. has been declining.��	-2.361199745
* Island row taking toll on sales for Japan automakers* Mazda down 35 pct in Sept but Audi up 20 pct* Other Japan automakers have not released Sept figures yet* Nissan and Toyota have curbed productionBy Fang Yan and Fayen WongBEIJING/SHANGHAI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp said on Thursday its China sales tumbled 35 percent in September from a year earlier, the first concrete numbers to point to problems faced by Japanese automakers in the wake of a territorial row between the two countries.Violent protests and calls for boycotts of Japanese products broke out across China in mid-September after Japan bought two of the East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and the Senkaku in Japanese, from their private owners.The tensions, which came as the two countries marked the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations, have started to affect a wide variety of Japanese firms, and have prompted some foreign investors to allocate funds away from Japan amid fears that a lasting reconciliation could be a long way off.China’s state-owned media have warned Japan that it could endure another “lost decade�� of economic stagnation should Beijing resort to economic retaliation if the dispute festers.Among other Japanese automakers, Nissan Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp have been forced to curb production after arsonists badly damaged their stores in the eastern port city of Qingdao -- a situation that stands in sharp contrast to other foreign automakers that had been adding capacity until recently.Mazda, which operates a three-way car venture in China with Ford Motor Co and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd , said it sold just 13,258 cars in the world’s biggest auto market in September. In August, it sold 17,497 cars, a milder slide of 11 percent from a year earlier.��(Japanese automakers) lost a lot of selling days ... There is no doubt that Mazda’s sales setback was a result of this very complicated situation between China and Japan,�� said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight.Naoto Oikawa, a Mazda spokesman based in Shanghai, said Mazda’s sales in China have been contracting every month since April.“I am sure there was some impact, but it’s difficult to say how much of the sales slide we saw last month was due to anti-Japan protests,�� he said.Other Japanese automakers have yet to release their September sales figures for China but other foreign brands are not feeling their pain. Volkswagen’s premium brand Audi increased sales in China by 20 percent to 35,512 vehicles in September.For the year to date, Mazda’s sales are down 6 percent.China is Japan’s largest trading partner. In 2011, their bilateral trade grew 14.3 percent in value to a record $345 billion. Exports to Japan, however, make up less than 10 percent of China’s total.Standard &amp; Poor’s warned this week that while Japanese firms�� credit ratings were not likely to suffer much from the dispute at the moment, that could change.“If the political confrontation drags on and further worsens ties between both countries, it may hurt Japan’s macro economy and affect the credit quality of rated Japanese companies on a large scale,�� said Standard &amp; Poor’s credit analyst Naoko Nemoto.Airlines have also suffered, with All Nippon Airways Co Ltd (ANA) saying that 40,000 seat-reservations were cancelled for flights between Japan and China from September to November.	3.000759686
Nineteenth wasn’t what Jimmie Johnson wanted in his first race with Cliff Daniels as his crew chief, but solid runs in the first two stages of Sunday’s GoBowling at The Glen were enough to lift the seven-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion into a tie for 16th in the series standings, the last spot eligible for the postseason Playoffs.Johnson started the race eighth and finished sixth in the first stage. In the second stage he was 10th, ultimately scoring enough points to tie 25th-place finisher Ryan Newman in the standings with four races left before the Playoff field is decided.On Lap 61, with an “assist�� from Ryan Blaney, Johnson backed into the tire barrier near the entrance to the carousel but was able to continue.“He just drove through me in the carousel,�� Johnson said of the contact with Blaney’s Ford. “I tried to hear what he was trying to say ... but his lips were quivering so bad when he came to speak (after the race). I don’t know if he was nervous or scared or both ... I don’t know what the problem is. He just drove through me and spun me out.“And clearly that has big implications with what we are trying to do for the Playoffs right now, so clearly not happy with his actions. We scored points in both stages, which was nice. We were setting up for top-eight to top-10 and got drove through. He claims it was just racing. So I can hardly wait to go racing. Everybody stay tuned.”Blaney, who is 10th in points and comfortably in the Playoff grid after a fifth-place finish, took issue with Johnson’s assessment.“It was just racing,�� Blaney asserted. “He had old tires. They just did gas only (on the previous pit stop), and he was pretty slow, and I passed 10 guys off the bus stop all day. He hit the third curb pretty bad and got in that position, and he was up, and I had a good run. I was there. He left probably a lane-and-a-quarter or so, and I took it.“At first, he didn’t turn down like I thought he knew I was there, and then he kept coming. I tried to check up, and it was just too late. I mean, obviously, I didn’t mean to spin him out. I don’t want to do that. It’s obviously an accident, but he was upset, and I can’t blame him for being upset about it. We’re just racing hard, and I thought there was a lane there, and it just closed.”Newman, who entered Sunday’s race 12 points ahead of Johnson, had trouble in the final stage. On lap 50, he pitted from 15th with a flat tire and lost a lap. Shortly thereafter, Newman returned to pit road with a loose wheel. Though he regained the lead lap as the highest scored lapped car under caution for Johnson’s collision with the tire barrier, Newman finished the race mired in 25th.Clint Bowyer came home 20th after finishing fourth in Stage 2, but the driver of the No. 14 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford maintained a 12-point edge over Johnson and Newman as the series heads for Michigan International Speedway.ERIK JONES CONTINUES IMPRESSIVE TOP-FIVE STREAK AT WATKINS GLENAfter finishing third twice and second once in his last three Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series starts, Erik Jones kept the top-five streak alive with a fourth place run in Sunday’s GoBowling at The Glen.Jones started 14th in the event after sliding in Turn 1 and blowing a tire on his first qualifying lap on Saturday. By the time the race restarted for the final stage on Lap 44, Jones was running eighth, and he worked his way forward from there.After the strong run, Jones remained 13th in the series standings, but his lead over a 16th-place tie between Jimmie Johnson and Ryan Newman grew to a relatively secure 54 points.“It’s good to keep it all going,�� Jones said. “Watkins Glen is kind of the wild card in there. Being a road course and everything, we’ve been on some tracks that have been really good to us, and Watkins Glen has been good to us, but you still never know what can happen on strategy. It worked out the best it really could.“I made a mistake yesterday (in qualifying). We started too far back, and just took us all day to get the DeWalt Camry up front. I felt like we had a fifth-place car all through practice, and we were able to get a little better finish than that.“It’s nice to keep that streak going and now going to two places -- Michigan next week and then Bristol -- where I think we can win. We have some really good momentum behind us these months. You can’t keep running up in the top-five every week and not win a race. That’s what I keep telling myself and hopefully we can do it here soon.”On Lap 62 of Sunday’s GoBowling at The Glen, Bubba Wallace and Kyle Busch exited Turn 7 side-by-side, fighting for position.Wallace steered to the right, banging doors with Busch’s No. 18 Toyota and forcing the car toward the wall that separates pit road from the racing surface. Busch turned his car back to the left and collided with Wallace’s No. 43 Ford.Down the long frontstretch, the two cars continued to bounce off each other until Busch edged ahead near the approach to Turn 1. That’s when Wallace rammed Busch’s back bumper and turned the No. 18 Toyota, which slid across the curbing before Busch could right the car and continue.Busch rallied to finish 11th. Wallace, who was 28th, said an earlier incident in the carousel triggered the animosity on the frontstretch.“He just run me over,�� Wallace said. “That’s exactly what happened. Two years in, or rookie stripe or what, I’m going to get my respect on the track, and I don’t care who does it. Some guys fail to think about the young guys, I guess, or with me.“So I won’t put up with no (junk). So, I flat-out wrecked him back. I guess we’re even -- we’ll see. That’s what happens when you get run over. You pay ‘em back. I won’t be like, ‘Oh, it’s Kyle Busch. He didn’t mean to.’�Busch left without commenting on the incident, other than to say, “You saw what happened.��---- Field Level Media	2.961808262
TOKYO, March 2 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday a CNN report linking an internal engineering memo to potential glitches that could cause sudden unintended acceleration in its cars was “grossly inaccurate��.CNN said on its website Toyota engineers had found an electronic software problem that caused sudden unintended acceleration in a test vehicle during pre-production trials, citing an internal engineering report, in Japanese, that it had obtained and translated.A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo repeated the company’s explanation on CNN that the broadcaster’s translations were wrong, noting the term “unintended sudden acceleration�� appeared nowhere in the Japanese document. He added that the document concerned a fail-safing test for adaptive cruise control on a prototype vehicle that had nothing to do with sudden acceleration.The U.S. government in early 2011 cleared Toyota’s electronics of causing unintended acceleration, ending an extensive probe conducted by engineers both at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and NASA.“In the face of overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary, CNN has irresponsibly aired a grossly inaccurate segment on Anderson Cooper 360 that attempts to resurrect the discredited, scientifically unproven allegation that there is a hidden defect in Toyota’s electronic throttle control system that can cause unintended acceleration,�� Toyota said in a statement.CNN interviewed one independent safety expert and a mechanical engineer in the Anderson Cooper news show, both of whose interpretations were based on CNN’s translations.Toyota recalled millions of vehicles in the United States to fix potential problems of unintended acceleration, focusing on mechanical issues with “sticky�� accelerator pedals and the risk that floormats could trap the pedal in the open position. U.S. investigators concluded that most reports of runaway acceleration could be explained by driver error.Links of letters sent to Turner Broadcasting System from Toyota, as well as the original document and translations provided by CNN, can be seen on its website.	6.708517971
TOKYO (Reuters) - Fewer than one in five Japanese companies plan to raise base wages in the coming business year, a Reuters survey shows, a stark sign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus policies are still struggling to gain traction.Some big names, like Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, are expected to raise base pay, but the bulk of companies in the Reuters Corporate Survey say they will at most raise bonuses, which can easily be reversed if the economic recovery lapses.While bonuses account for an average 17 percent of a Japanese worker’s total compensation, the survey points to diminished purchasing power for many workers.Only 11 percent of firms said they plan to lift overall remuneration - bonuses plus any rise in base pay - by enough to cover a 3 percentage point rise in the national sales tax that takes effect April 1.Abenomics has spurred economic growth and sharp climbs in corporate profits with bold monetary easing and government spending, but economists argue that base pay hikes, along with more capital spending, are key to transitioning to a self-sustaining recovery.Since taking office in December 2012, Abe has publicly pressured big business to raise wages. Workers at major companies like Toyota, Hitachi Ltd 6501.T, Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp 5401.T are demanding higher base pay for the year from April.Toyota is likely to raise base pay for the first time in six years, according to suppliers for the carmaker. Toyota officials told reporters on Wednesday that nothing was decided as negotiations are still underway.But the survey, conducted Feb 3-17 for Reuters by Nikkei Research, indicates such largesse remains the exception as executives across a broad range of industries said they remain leery of raising fixed costs amid an uncertain economic outlook.“If we went ahead with a fixed increase in wages, we would not be able to respond to fluctuations in business conditions,�� wrote one executive at a wholesaler in a typical response.Of the 241 firms that replied to a question on their stance on salary negotiations, 66 percent said they would lift bonuses but not underlying compensation, while 16 percent plan no increases at all. That represents a slightly more encouraging stance than in September when 60 percent described their basic stance as to lift bonuses but not base wages, while 24 percent were not considering any pay increases.Shintaro Okuno, a partner at consultants Bain &amp; Co Japan, who reviewed the results of the survey, said Japanese firms, having developed a lean cost structure to cope when the yen was high, were loathe to give that flexibility up.“One of the few management (tactics) to counter instability of the future is to keep your fixed costs as lean as possible,�� he said.The results come just as worries mount that the Abenomics boost is fading. Japan’s economy, after leading the Group of Seven powers in the first half of 2013, skidded to annual growth of 1 percent in the second half, hurt by weakness in exports, private consumption and capital spending.Sentiment at Japanese manufacturers slipped in February for the first time in five months and is seen sliding further, the Reuters Tankan survey, taken alongside the corporate survey, showed.Concerns mentioned by executives in the comment sections of the corporate survey, included the impact of the sales tax hike on consumer sentiment, increased competition as well as rises in energy costs.The poll also showed deep-seated skepticism that the Bank of Japan can meet its goal of lifting the world’s third-biggest economy out of 15 years of deflation by next year.Given the headwinds, just 15 percent of respondents think prices will increase by 2 percent or more in a year from now, after stripping out the effect of the sales tax hike. Including the tax increase, however, 69 percent expect inflation to meet or beat the target.The Reuters Corporate Survey polls upper management at 400 companies each capitalized at more than 1 billion yen. The firms, split evenly between manufacturers and non-manufacturers, respond anonymously.	-7.220216606
"DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales rose 9 percent in December, led by foreign manufacturers, capping off the best year for the industry since before the recession.The year’s sales were driven by a slowly recovering economy, more available credit and the need for consumers and businesses to replace aging cars and trucks.General Motors Co GM.N posted December U.S. sales growth of 5 percent compared with the year-earlier month, Ford Motor Co F.N increased sales 2 percent and Chrysler Group LLC's sales rose 10 percent.Wall Street cheered the results, sending GM and Ford stock to their highest levels since July 2011. GM shares ended 2.4 percent higher at $29.82 and Ford shares were up 2 percent to end at $13.46 on Thursday.Research and consulting firm Polk said it expects U.S. auto sales to hit 15.3 million vehicles in 2013. GM and Ford both predicted industry sales of more than 15 million vehicles, but Toyota Motor Corp 7201.T offered a more modest forecast of 14.7 million vehicles.For the year just ended, U.S. auto sales rose 13.5 percent to nearly 14.5 million new vehicles, the best performance since 2007, according to Reuters calculations.In the decade prior to 2008 when the recession slowed the industry, U.S. auto sales averaged nearly 17 million vehicles a year.While last month’s auto sales showed little impact of jitters caused by the so-called fiscal cliff - which proved largely averted - automakers expressed worry over the fog of uncertainty still emanating from Washington.The impact of a payroll tax increase that took effect at the start of the year and the upcoming congressional debate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling may keep some consumers out of the market in 2013, several automakers said.""It would have been nice if all the open questions had been resolved in the 'fiscal cliff' discussion over the holiday, but clearly they weren't, and that does extend this period of uncertainty from a consumer point of view,"" Jonathan Browning, head of Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE American unit, told reporters on a conference call.A 2 percentage-point payroll tax increase will take about $1,000 from the average household budget, said Ford economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick.“It is something that we’re looking at very carefully, as it will crimp the consumer spending scene somewhat in the months ahead,�� said Hughes-Cromwick.Jesse Toprak, analyst with TrueCar.com, said the hit to households would be about the same amount as a down payment on a new vehicle.“The cheap financing and improved income will make up for that, but that’s something we’re going to have a keep an eye on,�� he said.Hughes-Cromwick said the tax increases for the wealthiest Americans will not greatly affect auto sales, because they tend to purchase new vehicles even if taxes change.Tom Libby, an analyst at Polk, said continued low interest rates along with an improved housing sector and new product offerings from major automakers will make 2013 a bullish year for the industry.Detroit's automakers showed December U.S. sales gains of 5 percent, slightly better than analysts' expectations, but not enough to stave off market-share gains by Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T.The two largest Japanese automakers in the U.S. market rebounded from poor showings in 2011 when their inventory was constrained after the Japan earthquake and tsunami.Toyota reported a 9 percent U.S. sales increase for December, which met analysts�� expectations. Honda’s December sales rose 26 percent but fell short of analysts�� expectations. Honda sales are up 24 percent on the year.Toyota’s 2012 U.S. sales rose about 27 percent, compared with gains of 3.7 percent for GM, 4.7 percent for Ford, and 21 percent for Chrysler.GM’s U.S. market share is now at its lowest level since at least 1960, and probably at a low not seen since 1930, according to industry journal Ward’s Auto.GM and Ford lost market share in 2012, dented by competition from Toyota and Honda which recovered from 2011 earthquake-related setbacks.GM’s 2012 market share fell to 17.9 percent from 19.6 percent in 2011. Its market share was 23.5 percent in 2007, before the recession. Ford’s 2012 market share fell to 15.5 percent from 16.8 percent in 2011.“We’re always concerned about market share - always,�� said Mark Reuss, GM chief in North America. “But we’re not going to give it away like we did in the past and burn the residuals and the brand values in anticipation of the biggest product portfolio launch that we’ve had in history.”Reuss referred to the years before GM’s 2009 bankruptcy and taxpayer bailout, when vehicle production outpaced demand and it layered on incentives to lower prices for consumers.The F-Series pickup truck from Ford, the top-selling vehicle in North America for more than three decades, had its best sales month in December since August 2007.The F-Series remained the best-selling vehicle in the United States, with annual sales of 645,316, followed again by the full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup, at 418,312.Most luxury brands had a good year. BMW BMWG.DE for the second straight year edged German rival Mercedes-Benz for the U.S. sales crown, followed by Toyota's Lexus and Honda's Acura.The two U.S. luxury brands both saw sales fall in 2012, with Cadillac down 1.7 percent and Lincoln off 4.1 percent.Japanese models swept the next four places, with Toyota Camry leading the Honda Accord, Honda Civic and Nissan Altima. Chrysler’s Ram pickup placed seventh, followed by Toyota Corolla, Ford Escape and Ford Focus.Both GM and Ford went into the recession that began in late 2007 - and into 2008 when gasoline prices spiked - overladen with low-mileage big pickup trucks and SUVs.GM said on Thursday that in 2012 it sold in the U.S. market more than 1 million vehicles that get at least 30 miles per gallon in highway driving. And Ford said that in the year it sold the most small cars since 2001.Sales of high-profile hybrid and electric vehicles were a mixed bag in 2012. GM’s Chevrolet Volt tripled sales to 23,461, but still fell well short of the company’s original goal of 40,000 vehicles. Nissan’s Leaf was virtually flat, at 9,819.Toyota maintained its lead in the green-car category, with total Prius sales of 236,659, up 73 percent with the addition of three new Prius derivatives in the past year.Chrysler easily beat analysts' expectations and had its 33rd consecutive month of year-on-year sales gains. Its annual sales rose 21 percent. Its market share in 2012 rose to 11.4 percent from 10.7 percent in 2011. Chrysler is majority-owned by Italian automaker Fiat SpA FIA.MI.Sales for South Korea's Hyundai Motor Corp 000270.KS and Kia Motors Co 005380.KS rose 5 percent. Hyundai, the larger of the sister companies, reported full-year U.S. sales of 703,007 vehicles, a company record.Volkswagen reported a monthly increase of 31.5 percent for its namesake brand and luxury brands Audi and Porsche and a 30 percent gain for the full year.December sales fell 12 percent for Lincoln, Ford’s luxury brand.Aided heavily by consumer incentives that reduce the price of the vehicles, GM in December dramatically trimmed its inventory of full-size pickup trucks to 80 days of supply from 139 days at the end of November. Most automakers like to have about 80 days of supply of these pickup trucks.For the overall industry, the pace of annual sales increases has been in the double digits since the market bottomed in 2009, when it hit the worst annual sales rate since World War Two, adjusting for population."	0.5033901788
June 15 (Reuters) - Former Formula One driver Kamui Kobayashi smashed the Le Mans lap record on Thursday as Toyota swept the front row in qualifying for the 24 Hour sportscar race and left Porsche trailing.The Japanese, sharing the number seven TS050 hybrid car with Britain’s Mike Conway and Frenchman Stephane Sarrazin, went round the Circuit de la Sarthe in three minutes 14.791 seconds during the day’s second session.The time, at an average speed of 251.882kph, was more than two seconds quicker than the previous record of 3:16.887 set by Switzerland’s Neel Jani for Porsche in 2015 qualifying.It was also faster than German driver Hans Stuck’s 1985 pole of 3:14.800 set on a shorter track with fewer corners.Kobayashi had already put Toyota on provisional pole on Wednesday after lapping in 3:18.793 in the opening night session.“Mike Conway told me the car was perfect, so I set off fully confident ... I had 100 percent confidence in the car and when you’re in that frame of mind, you can do great things,�� said Kobayashi.“It was an incredible lap, the car was amazing, and we went after it without any trouble whatsoever with traffic. It surpassed all our hopes. It’s rare to be able to say this, but it was a perfect lap.“When I saw the time as I crossed the line, I said to myself, wow!”Only one Japanese manufacturer has won Le Mans, Mazda in 1991, and Toyota -- five times runners up -- have made winning the world’s greatest sportscar race their main motorsport target after losing to Porsche for the past two years.The number eight Toyota, driven by Britain’s Anthony Davidson, Japan’s Kazuki Nakajima and Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi, qualified second in a time of 3:17.128 with Nakajima at the wheel.In an endurance race where pace is nothing without reliability, qualifying is more about bragging rights ahead of a gruelling weekend.Champions Porsche filled the second row, with Jani the fastest of their drivers in the number one 919 hybrid car he shares with Germany’s Andre Lotterer and Britain’s Nick Tandy.The German carmaker won last year’s race after Toyota had victory snatched from their grasp by a last lap power failure just as Nakajima had seemed destined to take the chequered flag in front of 263,000 spectators.The 85th edition of the race starts on Saturday.

(Corrects percentage in headline to 9 pct from 20 pct)FRANKFURT, April 1 (Reuters) - Volkswagen will boost its global headcount to 600,000 by 2018 from 550,000 as part of its aim to become the world’s biggest carmaker, works council chief Bernd Osterloh told a German newspaper.“Volkswagen is growing, and is therefore continuing to hire in production,�� daily Handelsblatt cited Osterloh as saying in an excerpt of an interview to be published on Tuesday.Volkswagen, which delivered around 9.1 million vehicles last year, has said it hopes to replace Toyota Motor Corp as the world’s top-selling carmaker in 2018.It is banking on growth abroad to offset weak demand for cars in Europe and is working on plans to almost double production capacity in China over the next five years.Osterloh told Handelsblatt that Volkswagen would add new staff “less in Europe, rather more in China��. More than half of Volkswagen’s employees already are based outside its German home market. (Reporting by Maria Sheahan; editing by Jane Baird)	14.43721861
TOYOTA CITY, Japan/IRVINE, California (Reuters) - In 1997, Toyota caught its competitors by surprise with the revolutionary Prius, the first commercially successful gasoline-electric hybrid car. Now, the Japanese firm is trying to do the same with a technology that seems straight out of science fiction.Toyota Motor Corp will next year launch a hydrogen-powered car in the United States, Japan and Europe. For now, people at Toyota are calling it the 2015 FC car, for fuel-cell.Fuel-cell cars use a “stack�� of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity that helps propel the car. Their only emission, bar heat, is water vapor, they can run five times longer than battery electric cars, and it takes just minutes to fill the tank with hydrogen - far quicker than even the most rapid charger can recharge a battery electric car.The 2015 launch culminates a 20-year zig-zag quest during which Toyota first struggled to get the technology to work and then strained to lower manufacturing costs enough to permit realistic pricing. It has also been playing catch-up to rival Honda Motor Co, which has set the early pace with its FCX Clarity, a sleek, purpose-built hydrogen car.The cost-cutting continues, though Toyota thinks it has cracked the code with incremental design improvements, such as using wider, flatter “fettuccine-style�� copper in coils that make the motor more powerful, and thus smaller and cheaper.“With the 2015 FC car we think we’ve achieved a degree of dominance over our rivals,�� Satoshi Ogiso, a Toyota managing director, said in a recent interview at the group’s global headquarters. “With the car, we make a first giant step�� toward making fuel-cell vehicles practical for everyday use.What’s more, executives and engineers say Toyota is willing to sell the car at a loss for a long while to popularize the new technology - just as it did with the Prius, which, with other hybrids, now accounts for 14 percent of Toyota’s annual sales, excluding group companies, of around 9 million vehicles.As a result, drivers in key “green�� markets such as California may be able to buy the car for a little more than $30,000-$40,000, after government subsidies - if management approves a pricing strategy put forward by a group of managers and engineers. General Motors Co’s Chevrolet Volt, a near-all-electric plug-in hybrid, for comparison, starts at around $35,000 in the United States.The stakes are high - for global automakers, oil producers, economies, and the environment.As with battery electric cars, a major challenge for fuel-cell automakers is a lack of infrastructure, with few hydrogen fuel stations in the world. Estimates vary, but it costs about $2 million to build a single hydrogen fuel station in the United States, according to Toyota executives.Safety is also a concern. Hydrogen is a highly flammable element when not handled properly.The Toyota launch pits fuel-cell technology against battery electric in a race to capture the hearts and wallets of drivers looking for engines that are easier on the environment. Automakers are under pressure to invest in so-called “zero-emission�� cars as tougher rules globally demand lower harmful emissions and better fuel economy.It’s a polarizing debate.Takeshi Uchiyamada, the 67-year-old “father of the Prius�� whose success catapulted him from mid-level engineer to Toyota board chairman, says technology inefficiencies will make the battery electric car little more than an “errands car�� - a small run-around for shopping, dropping the kids at school and other short-haul chores.Other global automakers in the fuel-cell camp include Daimler AG, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda, which plans to introduce an upgraded FCX Clarity next year with seating for five, a smaller fuel-cell stack, greater power and a longer driving range.Those betting on battery electric cars include Nissan Motor Co, Tesla Motors Inc, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, GM, Ford Motor Co and Chinese automakers backed by the country’s industrial policymakers. China offers generous purchase incentives for those buying battery electric cars and aims to have 5 million “new energy�� vehicles - mostly all-electric and near all-electric plug-in hybrids - on the road by 2020. Several of these will be exhibited at the Beijing auto show from April 20.Tesla chief Elon Musk has said hydrogen is an unsuitable fuel for cars. In a videotaped speech last year to employees and others at a new Tesla service center in Germany, Musk said: “Fuel-cell is so bullshit. Hydrogen is a quite dangerous gas. It’s suitable for the upper-stage rocket, but not for cars.”Even Toyota only expects tens of thousands of fuel-cell cars to be sold each year a decade from now as the new technology will need time to gain traction.It’s been a long road for Toyota to get this far.Ogiso, who was part of the team that came up with the Prius and now leads the development of hydrogen cars, likens the two-decade effort to “racing cars in dark tunnels.”�You don’t know whether you’re ahead or behind,�� said the 53-year-old engineer-turned executive.Just a decade ago, it cost more than $1 million to manufacture a fuel-cell vehicle propulsion system. Toyota has whittled down those costs and overcome technological hurdles, such as how to start the car in very cold weather.In October 2003, a materials researcher at Toyota’s tech center in Ann Arbor, Michigan gave a presentation in which he highlighted the difficulty his team faced in solving this issue. Shortly afterwards, rival Honda said it developed a fuel-cell car that could run in temperatures as low as minus 20 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). “It was embarrassing, and we were yelled at by the big bosses,�� recalled a person familiar with the incident.Five years later, there was more embarrassment at the hands of Honda - what Toyota fuel-cell engineers call the “Clarity shock�� - referring to Honda’s launch of the FCX Clarity. “Honda built every part of that from the ground up, and it had cool styling,�� said a Toyota engineer who has been on the fuel-cell team for more than a decade. “It sent shockwaves through our team.”On a single floor of Toyota’s research tower, across the street from the headquarters, some 200 material scientists, chemists, computer programmers and mechanical engineers worked to nail down the hydrogen electric fuel-cell technology they needed.A sizeable chunk of the cost savings has come from using less platinum as a catalyst in the electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in fuel economies. Toyota says its 2015 hydrogen car should drive 700 km (435 miles) on a single tank, more than many conventional gasoline-engine cars, and a strong selling point to those worried about driving range.Ogiso and his engineers are reluctant to talk specifically about how they made their breakthrough, but noted Toyota’s expertise in nanotechnology, allowing them to shrink platinum particles to better combine oxygen and hydrogen and generate more electricity. That allowed them to reduce the size of the cell stack and use less fuel to make the car go farther.Ogiso says Toyota has cut the platinum use per car by more than two-thirds through nanotechnology and stack-design improvements, and he expects to trim that further. Engineer Hitoshi Nomasa said a hydrogen-powered Toyota SUV now uses around 30 grams of platinum in the fuel-cell, down from 100 grams previously. Platinum currently costs $1,437 an ounce (28 grams) on world markets.Toyota has also borrowed spare parts from the Prius and other gasoline-electric hybrids it sells around the world. While the fuel-cell car uses hydrogen as fuel, it otherwise resembles the hybrid models as both use electricity to power their motors.“Very roughly ... under the hood of the 2015 FC car lie more or less the exact same components used for the Prius and other hybrids,�� said another Toyota fuel-cell engineer, referring to the electric motor, “transaxle�� gear and hybrid battery pack, among the parts lifted from the hybrid spares bin.Even the incremental advance with the “fettuccine coils�� - the wide, flat-shaped copper wire can bind the coil more tightly and needs less space - took the Toyota team a decade to hone.While costs have come down significantly, Toyota says a hydrogen car’s fuel-cell propulsion system alone still costs it close to $50,000 to produce. That’s partly why some Toyota money managers want a more conservative pricing strategy - of $50,000-$100,000 - said one individual on the 2015 FC car launch team.“It might be tough to price it below $50,000,�� Ogiso said. “But anything is possible at this point.��(Editing by Ian Geoghegan)	-0.02761413844
(Fixes verb tense in second paragraph.)DETROIT, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp said on Thursday it will expand to additional states its recall of vehicles with Takata Corp passenger-side air bags after U.S. regulators requested it.Mazda was among 10 automakers that began in June to conduct regional recalls of vehicles with passenger-side front-seat air bags supplied by Takata, at the request of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.NHTSA previously requested and Mazda recalled vehicles in a limited area covering Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and U.S. Virgin Islands.Mazda’s recall area now includes Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia as well as Guam, Saipan, and American Samoa.Including models recalled earlier, Mazda will tell owners of about 87,000 vehicles with Takata passenger-side air bags to bring them to dealerships for replacement parts.Defective Takata air bag inflators, which can explode and shoot shrapnel into the car, have been linked to five deaths. More than 16 million cars have been recalled globally since 2008.Last month, Takata declared that the passenger-side air bags may be defective in the wider area.The Japan-based supplier says that manufacturing problems could lead to defects if the inflators are in high-humidity areas for extended periods.This action is separate from a NHTSA demand for five automakers including Mazda to recall nationwide certain older-model vehicles with Takata-made driver-side air bags. Mazda has yet to say whether it will comply with the request. Germany’s BMW has also not responded to NHTSA’s request.Other carmakers including Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp have already agreed to go nationwide with the driver-side air bag recall, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has so far refused.Mazda said in a press statement issued Thursday that it has agreed to join an initiative proposed by Toyota Motor Corp for independent, industrywide joint tests of Takata air bag inflators.	-4.386576765
TOKYO, Sept 16 (Reuters) - On an empty lot in Japan’s fourth-largest city, a Shinto priest performs rites in front of a makeshift altar loaded with offerings of fruit and vegetables to pray for the safety and success of Japan’s newest hydrogen filling station.The small ceremony in central Nagoya earlier this month, attended by executives from operator Toyota Tsusho and construction firm Obayashi Corp, was another step in the world’s most ambitious plans to use hydrogen to run cars and, eventually, produce electricity.Hydrogen, which produces only heat and water when burned, is often seen as an environmentally friendly source of energy, but it also carries safety concerns - particularly in Japan, where images of the hydrogen explosions that rocked the Fukushima nuclear plant remain seared in the collective memory.Plans for a so-called hydrogen society will not only have to prove the commercially untested technology can be viable - they must also win over a public that, three-and-half years on from the Fukushima disaster, remains deeply sceptical of government and industry’s promises in the energy field.“People are concerned about safety after the incident at nuclear plant,�� said Miki Kubo, a council member in Saitama, who is supporting about 1,000 local residents trying to prevent construction of a hydrogen station in the centre of the city that abuts Tokyo.“Why do they have to build it here in the middle of a residential area?”Planning permission for the station has not been given and Tokyo Gas Co has had to revise its plans three times to accommodate public concerns.The company, which planned to start building the station that incorporates a hydrogen production unit as well as a filling stand about a year ago, has had to increase the distance from nearby houses and built a wall to protect residents. Tokyo Gas said it is aiming to start operations by the end of March, should it get planning approval.Despite the obstacles, there are powerful forces supporting the hydrogen push - a key element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s reform agenda - such as the desire to reduce expensive fuel imports and an inevitable cutback on nuclear power, rejected by a majority of the public after Fukushima.And the concerns have not stopped companies such as Toyota Tsusho and JX Holdings investing in the infrastructure needed to supply hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles (FCVs).Toyota Motor Corp is expected to start selling FCVs to the public around January priced at about 7 million yen ($65,800).Key to their success will be whether enough potential buyers have easy assess to a refuelling station.Under certain conditions hydrogen is explosive when in contact with oxygen, although as a light gas it dissipates easily.Industry groups are lobbying for an easing of government rules on siting and storage for hydrogen stations, which are stricter than for gasoline stands.“Many people are worried about hydrogen and whether it’s going to explode, to put it in extreme terms,�� said Koji Nakagawa, general manager for Toyota Tsusho.“But it is not only hydrogen that can explode or burn - when you take into consideration other widely used resources like LP gas, hydrogen is not particularly dangerous.”Emiko Nakanishi, 52, who lives near the new Nagoya hydrogen station, thinks the environmental benefits outweigh safety concerns, but is still worried about convenience.“I’m curious about how much fuel cell cars are going to cost and I want them to become popular,�� she said. “But my impression is that they will be less convenient than conventional gasoline cars.”The government is promising $20,000 cash back on the cost of every FCVs and other subsides of up to $2.6 million per filling stations - about half the total cost - to achieve a target to build 100 by March 2016 and as many as 1,000 by 2025.Most analysts are sceptical that those targets will be met, but investments are also being made in hydrogen production facilities to supply FCVs, which run on electricity made by cells that combine hydrogen and oxygen, and other uses.The hydrogen revolution goes well beyond cars.By 2020 the government aims to have 1.4 million households installed with fuel cells and hydrogen powered turbines available for factories.Its hydrogen society is due to fully kick in by 2030, with utility scale power generation from the fuel planned and 10 percent of houses, or 5.3 million, relying on fuel cells, from 76,000 now. By then the cost of hydrogen and its availability is expected to make it commercially viable to replace fossil fuels.“The hydrogen initiative in Japan has long and strong legs,�� said Andrew De Wit, professor of public finance at Rikkyo University. There is “plenty of Japanese government money pushing it along, together with the demonstrated commitment of Toyota��.Exactly how “green�� hydrogen energy is varies depending on how the gas is produced. Most currently comes from heating fossil fuels in a process called reforming. But sources are diverse and potentially cheaper than fossil supplies.Japan will initially rely on imports of the fuel, but in the longer term plans to exploit Japan’s booming solar industry, along with wind and hydro electric production, as a homegrown source, according to industry and government. The government has also set a target of carbon-free hydrogen production by 2040.JX, Japan’s largest oil refiner, and other refining companies, its biggest industrial gas supplier, Iwatani Corp, and companies including Chiyoda Corp and Kawasaki Heavy are set to benefit should the dream of a hydrogen society come true.For now, that remains a long way off.“There is no way we are turning out a profit in, say, five or 10 years,�� president of JX Nippon Oil &amp; Energy Corp, Tsutomu Sugimori, said, asked if it can make money from FCV stations. “We aim to contribute to realising the hydrogen society and we want the first-mover’s advantage.��	-6.301556255
TOKYO (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp's 7269.T president said the Japanese automaker will not join efforts by Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T to develop batteries for electric vehicles, but a supply deal could be possible.Toyota on Wednesday said it is considering making EV batteries with Panasonic to help meet its goal for green cars to comprise half of global sales by 2030.Automakers are competing to launch more EVs to meet tightening regulations on vehicle emissions, and have been announcing partnerships with parts suppliers and other companies to meet the high costs of developing new technologies.Toshihiro Suzuki, speaking at a product launch in Tokyo on Thursday, told reporters there was “no room�� to join the tie-up between Toyota and Panasonic, but that a supply arrangement was possible.Suzuki and Toyota have agreed to trade expertise in parts supplies and research and development, including selling electric vehicles in India.	10.376
TOYOTA CITY, Dec 14 (Reuters) - As Toyota Motor Corp’s newest Prius rolls off the production line starting this month, the automaker said that the latest model of the world’s best-selling gasoline hybrid had boosted Japanese car production by around 14 percent from a year ago.“This Prius is contributing to an increase in overall average daily domestic production to around 14,000 cars, for the first time in a while,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters at a plant near the company’s headquarters on Monday.That figure marks a jump from a daily average production of 12,300 cars in December 2014, when production had eased ahead of new model launches at the start of this year, according to a Toyota spokesman.Toyota launched the fourth-generation Prius in Japan last week, and will market the latest version of the world’s first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car in other regions in the coming months.The automaker has said it has received domestic orders for around 60,000 new Priuses so far. It is targeting average global annual sales of 300,000-350,000, the lower end of the initial annual sales target of 300,000-400,000 for the previous model.Average daily vehicle production can swing from month to month due to new product launches and seasonal factors, but the spokesman said the company’s domestic output largely sticks to a rough range of around 11,000-14,000.Daily production at Toyota’s domestic plants has been creeping up each year even before the Prius went into production, averaging 13,700 in September compared with 13,500 a year ago, according to the company’s latest available figures.Output climbed to 14,800 in March 2014 due to a surge in demand ahead of a rise in Japanese consumption tax the following month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it would aim to bring to market cars that can autonomously change lanes, merge with traffic, and overtake other vehicles on highways by around 2020 as it aims to catch up in the nascent field of self-driving cars.Demonstrating its newest safety technology features to media on Tuesday, Japan’s biggest automaker said in that car of the future, drivers would be able to turn on and off the auto-pilot mode with a single switch.Toyota also said it would launch three models in Japan this year equipped with “intelligent transportation system�� (ITS) technology, which allows vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication to alert drivers to potential dangers using sensor technology.The face-lifted Crown sedan unveiled in the domestic market last week was the world’s first car to use ITS technology, Toyota said. The fourth-generation Prius hybrid, due for launch in Japan at year-end, will be among the three models, it said.	0.1711351968
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it had sold some of its shares in Tesla Motors Inc but that it would continue to study possible cooperation with the U.S. electric car maker in the future.Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, invested $50 million in the Palo Alto-based startup in May 2010 ahead of Tesla’s initial public offering in June that year.Toyota said at the time the investment would give it a stake of about 2.5 percent, but the size of its current stake is not clear. Toyota said it would not disclose the timing or amount of the latest sale, which was first reported by the Nikkei business daily.“We will continue to have good relations with Tesla,�� Toyota spokesman Ryo Sakai said, adding that the sale resulted from Toyota’s regular review of its investments.Tesla’s shares were trading at $236 on Thursday, up from their IPO price of $17.Tesla has been supplying batteries and motors for Toyota’s RAV4 electric SUVs that went on sale in 2012, but that arrangement is set to end this year after Toyota sold just 2,000 of the vehicles.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company could sign a new deal with Toyota over the next two to three years.Daimler AG, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, said earlier this week it sold its remaining 4 percent stake in Tesla for a gain of $780 million. Daimler took a 9.1 percent stake in Tesla for around $50 million in May 2009.	6.069338922
Nov 1(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to roll out hybrid versions of its large sport utility vehicles from 2016 to prepare for tougher environmental regulations, the Nikkei reported, quoting sources.The automaker intends to develop hybrid systems capable of powering such big vehicles, the newspaper reported.Toyota plans to add a hybrid version of the Land Cruiser SUV to the line-up and introduce such versions of its international multipurpose vehicles, such as the Fortuner, designed for emerging markets, the business daily reported.Toyota, which debuted its first mass-produced hybrid car, the Prius, in 1997, now offers about 20 hybrid models, mostly passenger cars, according to the Nikkei.The company has sold more than 5 million hybrid cars globally so far, the newspaper said.Toyota’s hybrid cars such as the Crown are 20-30 percent more fuel-efficient than non-hybrid models, the Nikkei said.Improving mileage has become a key issue for automakers as the United States and other countries tighten environmental rules, the newspaper said.	-4.36189889
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several U.S. auto dealers derive a significant portion of their revenue from imported vehicles, which could be affected if tariffs are imposed on auto imports.The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday that it would investigate whether vehicle and auto parts imports were threatening the health of the U.S. auto industry, including its ability to develop new technologies. The investigation could lead to tariffs similar to the ones imposed on steel and aluminum.Shares of auto dealers, several of which have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 .SPX since early February, were mostly higher on Thursday. Risks to dealers' performance may be partially priced in, said Ali Faghri, managing director of Guggenheim Securities in Los Angeles. ""But there's nothing that suggests (dealers) would be insulated,"" Faghri said, noting that higher auto prices resulting from tariffs could temper demand.Auto dealers typically break out their vehicle sales into three categories: domestic, import and luxury. Most auto brands classified as luxury, such as Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE and BMW BMWG.DE, are imported. The import category includes mid-range brands such as Toyota 7203.T and Honda 7267.T.Here are revenue breakdowns by segment of five of the largest publicly traded U.S. auto dealers.For the 2017 fiscal year, AutoNation Inc AN.N had $12.2 billion in revenue from new vehicles. Import sales made up 34.2 percent of that total, and luxury sales accounted for 31.5 percent.On Thursday, AutoNation shares fell 0.1 percent.Lithia Motors Inc LAD.N reported revenue of $10.09 billion for the 2017 fiscal year, excluding corporate losses. Of that total, 43.9 percent came from its import segment and 17.9 percent came from its luxury segment.Lithia Motors shares were up 0.7 percent on Thursday.For the 2017 fiscal year, Sonic Automotive Inc SAH.N reported new vehicle revenue of $5.3 billion, of which 54.6 percent came from luxury sales and 34.2 percent came from import sales.Sonic Automotive shares moved up 0.6 percent on Thursday.Asbury Automotive Group Inc ABG.N had new vehicle revenue of $3.56 billion for the 2017 fiscal year, according to its SEC filing. Of that total, 54.6 percent came from luxury sales and 34.2 percent came from import sales.On Thursday, shares of Asbury Automotive rose 2.4 percent.Group 1 Automobile Inc's GPI.N annual report breaks out the company's new vehicle revenue by automotive brand rather than by domestic, import and luxury segments.Of its $6.15 billion in new vehicle revenue, 76.5 percent came from non-domestic brands.

* Toyota Tsusho to buy 29.8 pct CFAO stake from PPR* PPR shares rise 2.6 pct* Toyota Tsusho may make offer for all of CFAO (Adds analyst comment, details premium)PARIS, July 26 (Reuters) - French luxury and retail group PPR has made a multi-million euro disposal in distribution firm CFAO, the company said on Thursday, as it seeks to cut debt and fund an expansion in luxury goods and sportswear.Japanese conglomerate Toyota Tsusho Corp has agreed to buy a 29.8 percent stake in CFAO, and may launch an offer for the whole company valuing it at 2.3 billion euros ($2.79 billion).CFAO is one of several assets PPR has been selling off as it pays down debt and eyes new acquisitions in the luxury and lifestyle sectors. Shares in PPR were 3 percent higher at 111.75 euros, among the top gainers on France’s blue-chip CAC 40 index .Toyota Tsusho is paying 37.50 euros a share for the stake in CFAO - a 15 percent premium to the average price over six months - and any offer for the remainder of the group would be at the same level, PPR said on Thursday.But the offer is below where CFAO shares closed on Wednesday. The distributor of vehicles and medicines in Africa and French overseas territories had already rallied 44 percent this year.CFAO shares were trading up 0.8 percent at 38.105 euros by 1054 GMT on Thursday, above the offer price.PPR has agreed to tender its remaining 12.2 percent stake in CFAO to any full offer, while Toyota Tsusho has accepted to pay an indemnity of 50 million euros to PPR in case it does not file a voluntary tender offer by Sept. 15.Toyota Tsusho will proceed with the offer once it has carried out due diligence on CFAO’s non-automotive businesses in the coming weeks, PPR said.The French luxury goods company, which reports first-half results later on Thursday, would receive 967.5 million euros for its entire 42 stake.“PPR will likely use the proceeds to pay down debt,�� Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said in a note.“It will continue to focus its efforts on selling the remaining legacy retail assets. In parallel, we believe PPR will continue to pursue tactical mid-sized acquisitions in luxury or lifestyle.”Chauvet said PPR could dispose of mail order business Redcats this year, with a sale of retail chain Fnac likely to come at a later stage. The group could also continue to boost its 80 percent stake in German sportswear brand Puma.CFAO generated sales of 3.1 billion in 2011. PPR sold nearly 58 percent of CFAO in a stock market listing in late 2009.Japanese conglomerate Toyota Tsusho has been expanding its automotive distribution business as well as other businesses such as energy, healthcare products, chemicals, machinery and consumer products.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Japanese and German automakers are benefiting more than their U.S. peers from a free trade deal between Washington and Seoul, according to import figures suggesting U.S. brands are not reaping the rewards they may have expected from the pact.U.S. automakers are battling a perception that they lag German peers in fuel efficiency just when sales figures show South Korean consumers are developing a particular taste for diesel-powered models, the German brands�� mainstay.German and Japanese carmakers boosted sales of U.S.-made vehicles last year by nearly five-fold from 2011, the year before the trade deal took effect, outpacing the 43 percent jump U.S. automakers reported during the same period, according to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association (KAIDA).South Korea, one of the few auto markets dominated by domestic carmakers, has emerged as a big source of growth for global brands following trade deals with Europe and the United States which cut import tariffs and ignited a sales bonanza.The South Korean market for imported cars exploded to 9.2 trillion won ($8.87 billion) last year, from just 1.5 trillion won in 2008, according to industry estimates. There were no total revenue figures for imported cars available for 2011.“The FTA did give us an opportunity to grow but it is not having a significant boost to our sales,�� an official at Cadillac said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.“Growth of foreign car sales in South Korea is mainly driven by expanding sales of diesel models, but there’s a dearth of diesel cars in the United States.”Despite the trade deal, U.S. automakers saw their share of South Korea’s imported car market shrink to 7.5 percent last year, from 7.9 percent in 2011, according to KAIDA.German brands led the pack with 67.5 percent of imported car sales last year, while Japanese companies were second on 14 percent.“U.S. cars are still perceived as bulky and less fuel-efficient than German and Japanese cars,�� Daelim University College automotive engineering Professor Kim Pil-soo said.German brands such as Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, BMW BMWG.DE and Mercedes DAIGn.DE have raised sales of U.S. imports by more than three-fold since 2011, according to the KAIDA data provided to Reuters.Volkswagen, which did not bring a single car from the United States to South Korea in 2011, sold almost 5,000 U.S.-made vehicles in the country last year.Unperturbed by the lack of a free trade pact between Tokyo and Seoul, Japanese firms have seized advantage of the Korea-U.S. deal to minimize the impact of a volatile yen and capitalise on lower tariffs on U.S. imports.The FTA immediately halved South Korea’s tariff on U.S. auto imports to 4 percent.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T boosted sales of their U.S.-made cars by seven-fold to 12,193 vehicles last year from 2011, the KAIDA data showed.That compared with 8,671 U.S.-produced vehicles sold by U.S. automakers, led by Ford Motor Co F.N and Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FIA.MI.The surge in U.S.-made Japanese imports has sparked scrutiny from South Korea’s customs office.Customs officials said they were reviewing whether U.S.-made Toyota cars were qualified to get a tariff benefit, which requires vehicles to contain at least 35 percent U.S.-origin materials.	-0.02761413844
"TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp 6752.T on Tuesday said output at the $5 billion battery ""Gigafactory"" it runs with electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O could soon increase as the causes of bottlenecks that have hobbled production are now understood.Panasonic, the world’s largest automotive lithium-ion battery manufacturer, makes battery cells to which Tesla adds electronics to make battery packs for its cars.Tesla earlier this month blamed manufacturing bottlenecks for limiting quarterly production of its mass-market Model 3 sedan to 260 vehicles rather than its 1,500 goal.Panasonic Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga said at an earnings briefing that delays to the automation of the battery pack production line meant some stages had to be completed manually.“This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply,�� Tsuga said. He declined to comment to what extent Model 3 production would be behind its targeted schedule.The comments came as Panasonic on Tuesday said automotive demand helped July-September operating profit rise 6 percent, beating analyst estimates. It maintained its 335 billion yen ($2.96 billion) forecast for the year ending March.Analysts have said Panasonic’s massive Gigafactory bet makes the firm highly sensitive to Tesla’s strategy. On Tuesday, Tsuga acknowledged the bottlenecks could impact earnings, but said the contract with Tesla was designed to hedge various risks. He also said battery businesses with other clients are profitable.Panasonic sees batteries as central to its plan to nearly double automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022. To that end, it has been aggressively expanding battery production capacity globally.It plans to start production this financial year ending March at a new plant in Dalian, China, and is adding production lines in Japan - steps that could allow it to reduce dependence on Tesla.Noboru Sato, a former battery engineer at Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and former vice president of South Korean rechargeable battery maker Samsung SDI Co Ltd 006400.KS, said Panasonic ""decided to build the plant in China on requests from Honda and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.""Toyota and Honda, already customers of Panasonic batteries, were seeking ways of procuring batteries in China, Sato said, as the government in the world’s largest automobile market promotes electric vehicles as a means of combating pollution.“Panasonic’s decision to produce batteries in China has solved their problems,�� Sato said.Panasonic, Honda and Toyota declined to comment."	-0.05625652978
(Adds data for GM, Toyota, Ford)March 1 (Reuters) - Canada auto sales slipped for the eleventh straight month in February, falling 3.7 percent from a year earlier to 120,891 units, according to industry data released on Friday.A report here released by Global Automakers Canada (GAC) said passenger car sales dropped 16 percent, while sales of trucks rose 1.2 percent, with the heavy goods vehicles representing nearly 75 percent of all sales in the month.The results were not unexpected said GAC President David Adams in a statement, adding that both January and February last year were very strong in terms of sales.“Also, when you factor in the significant snow and weather events that have occurred over the month of February across the country, the results are actually pretty good.”Separately, General Motors Co said its total vehicle sales in Canada fell 9 percent to 16,350 vehicles in February.Ford Motor Co’s Canada division reported total car sales of 2,057 and truck sales of 16,2014 in February, while total auto sales for Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp in Canada rose 1.4 percent in the same period with 13,419 units sold, according to the GAC report.Total February auto sales for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , which is among the top four carmakers in Canada, fell 2 percent to 18,461 vehicles. Sales dropped 11 percent for its brand Jeep.The company’s sales in the United States also dipped 2 percent, hurt by weak demand for Fiat 500 small city cars and Jeep Compass sport utility vehicles.General Motors and Ford Motor, the top two U.S. automakers, have stopped reporting monthly auto sales numbers. Toyota Motor reported a 5.2 percent drop in U.S. sales to 172,748 vehicles due to declines in its flagship Camry sedan as well as its Tundra pickup trucks and Sienna minivans.	1.232899848
(Adds quotes, details, background)ISTANBUL, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will begin production in Turkey this year of a new hybrid engine car model with an investment of more than 350 million euros ($396 million), the Japanese automaker said on Thursday.The investment will create more than 1,000 jobs and Toyota’s Turkish production capacity will rise to 280,000 vehicles from 150,000 currently, European chief executive Johan van Zyl told a news conference.“This is the first time somebody will make a hybrid vehicle in Turkey,�� he said. “The new model will be a crossover, a kind of SUV (sport utility vehicle), the entire world is moving to this kind of body style.”The investment will increase to 1.7 billion euros the company’s total investment in Turkey. It has a factory in the northwestern province of Sakarya, where it produces Corolla and Verso models.The new model’s name will be announced at the Geneva car show which begins in March, Toyota officials said. Van Zyl said the vehicle would be exported to 53 countries.Hiroshi Kato, chief executive of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Turkey, said the company exports 80 percent of its production and this level would rise to around 90 percent once it is in full-year production in 2017.	3.505605168
* Plan aims to recover production within two weeks* Will balance risk management with cost cuts -exec* Will turn half of components into common parts -execYOKOHAMA, Japan, March 2 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will have in place by autumn a more resilient supply chain that would recover within two weeks of another massive earthquake hitting Japan, a top executive said on Friday.Japanese automakers have been working to disaster-proof their sprawling supply chains ever since last year’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami devastated the country’s northeastern coast, forcing many to halt or reduce car production for more than six months.“We’ll know by the end of March what contingency measures will be taken by all the supply sources and have those in place by around autumn,�� executive vice president Shinichi Sasaki, who oversees purchasing at Toyota, told a small group of reporters.Sasaki said Toyota has now mapped the supply-chain make-up of about half of its 500-plus direct suppliers in Japan, allowing it to identify 1,500 sites responsible for Toyota’s components. Of those, he estimated about 300 were “at-risk�� locations that were single sources for almost 1,000 parts.To safeguard against a disruptive earthquake, Toyota is asking those suppliers to either spread production to multiple locations or hold extra stock. Another option is to buy the part from another supplier, Sasaki said.Those steps will be taken in tandem with efforts by Toyota to consolidate similar parts, providing suppliers with the economies of scale to set up a second facility, for instance, he said.“Our plan is to manage risk while at the same time reducing costs,�� he said.As part of broader efforts to lower costs, Toyota aims to develop common parts for about half of its 4,000-5,000 components within four years or so, Sasaki said.The other half of Toyota’s tier-one parts makers declined to disclose their suppliers, citing competitive reasons, but have promised their own contingency plans to ensure a production recovery within two weeks, Sasaki said.Japan is situated on the “Ring of Fire�� arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin and which accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.Seismologists have long warned of huge tremors hitting the central Tokai region -- home to most of Toyota’s domestic factories -- as well as the Tokyo area.The magnitude 9.0 quake last year damaged factories of hundreds of autoparts makers, particularly those of electronics components concentrated in Japan’s northeast. The sensitivity of precision-equipment makers to earthquakes forced a supply bottleneck at Renesas Electronics Corp, which was making microchip controllers at just one factory north of Tokyo.The extent of the ripple effect surprised the industry, which discovered the supply chain was not shaped like a pyramid, with automakers at the top, but more like a barrel, with a single obscure source at the bottom supplying several makers up the food chain.Toyota, known for its expertise in supply-chain management, which is part of the lean production system it pioneered, was no exception.“Our assumption that we had a total grip on our supply chain proved to be an illusion,�� Sasaki said.	6.708517971
TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday Kenta Kon will become its chief financial officer and the roles of some executives will be consolidated, as the Japanese automaker attempts to improve its production systems and cut costs further.Announcing a series of management changes, Toyota said in a statement that executive vice presidents Didier Leroy and Moritaka Yoshida would resign from their posts, while Leroy would continue as a company director.Kon currently serves as chief accounting officer.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Tuesday heard from advocates of imposing stricter safeguards for self-driving cars as part of any effort to speed the adoption of the vehicles on U.S. roads.At the same subcommittee hearing, groups representing automakers and tech companies touted benefits of autonomous vehicles and warned the United States risks falling behind China and other countries without new legal backing.U.S. lawmakers have been divided for years over what consumer and legal protections should be added to any self-driving legislation. Significant divisions emerged at Tuesday’s hearing and officials say the effort faces tough odds to win approval before the end of 2020, even as aides plan to release additional discussion drafts of self-driving legislative proposals.Automakers are eager to deploy commercial robotaxi fleets without human controls but none are expected until 2021 at the earliest.Representative Frank Pallone, the Democrat who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, said at the hearing “appropriate safeguards must be in place �� protections to ensure self-driving cars operate safely and adhere to state and local law.”Republicans argue autonomous vehicles are coming “and the question is whether we develop them here or not,�� Representative Greg Walden said.Jeffrey Tumlin, a San Francisco transportation official, testified Congress should require manufacturers to include event data recorders in autonomous vehicles to “preserve all information from sensors before a collision�� and ensure “every safety incident involving an autonomous vehicle is documented in a national database.”California requires companies testing self-driving cars to disclose all crashes involving the vehicles on public roads, even when under manual control. Those reports are made public as is data on disengagements of self-driving cars. Other states do not require disclosures.John Bozzella, who heads an auto trade association representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and others, said ""the worst outcome would be for Congress to delay the enactment of meaningful legislation that would establish the needed federal framework to realize these safety and mobility solutions.""Current regulations essentially bar deployment of vehicles without human controls. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) last week granted its first-ever temporary exemption for a fleet of delivery vehicles from SoftBank Group Corp backed Nuro Inc.Automakers oppose requiring airplane-style certification of new autonomous vehicle technologies before they are deployed on U.S. roads.Daniel Hinkle, a counsel at a trial lawyers group, testified “those who are injured or harmed by automated driving must be able to hold the driver manufacturer accountable.”Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the subcommittee, cast the issue in geopolitical terms, noting Chinese self-driving car developers in 2019 “logged the second-most miles of any country testing�� in California.Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, urged Congress to require tests for self-driving cars to ensure they can properly detect other vehicles and hazards and call for a mandatory manual override in all self-driving cars.Chase said in the “absence of federal regulation it’s the duty of states and localities�� to ensure that self-driving vehicles are safe."	-18.39500105
PHNOM PENH/BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Major brands including carmaker BMW and fashion label Zara are investigating reports of mass sackings of union workers in their supply chains, amid fears from labour advocates that coronavirus has fuelled ��union-busting�� at factories across Southeast Asia.As the pandemic batters the global economy, numerous Western retailers have cancelled orders or demanded discounts from suppliers in countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand, leading to many workers going without pay or being sacked.Unions and activists in the region said factory bosses were targeting and firing union members while keeping on non-unionised workers, and feared that the outbreak could spur a rollback of rights on issues from decent pay to safe workplaces.“Clearly some employers believe they can take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic slowdown to violate workers and their rights with impunity,�� said Robert Pajkovski, Thailand program director at the Solidarity Centre, a U.S.-based charity.Under rising pressure from campaigners and consumers alike to improve working conditions and tackle modern slavery, big-name brands have vowed in recent years to only do business with suppliers that allow workers to unionise and demand better pay.BMW said it had set up a “response team�� to pursue a complaint that one of its Thai suppliers, Sunstar Engineering, targeted unionists when it sacked 94 factory workers in May.“Whenever necessary, an escalation process is devised and launched and corrective action plans are developed with the supplier,�� BMW Group spokeswoman Saskia Eßbauer said.“When a supplier fails to take effective action, the BMW Group may potentially terminate the supply contract.”The leader of the in-house union - Phacharee Chompoo - said all but one of the sacked workers were members, while others who were not fired were instead pressured to leave the union.“No one wanted to leave the union, but it was a matter of survival,�� Phacharee told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Sunstar Engineering - based near Bangkok - confirmed that the sackings happened but denied singling out unionised workers.The factory also listed Honda, Yamaha, Harley-Davidson, General Motors and Isuzu among its global buyers. Honda declined to comment. Toyota said it was not sourcing from Sunstar. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.Fashion brands Bestseller, Mango, Primark and Zara said they had launched probes into reports of union-busting in Myanmar.“We acknowledge an increased risk of union-busting during COVID-19 ... (and) have therefore increased our due diligence,�� said Morten Norlyk, a spokesman for Danish retailer Bestseller.In one case, labour leaders and industry watchers said the Huabo Times factory in Pathein fired four union executives and 103 members three days after the union had been registered.Inditex-owned Zara confirmed it was looking into the issue, while Bestseller and Britain-based Primark said they were also investigating but that the sackings were in line with Myanmar’s labour laws. Huabo Times could not be reached for comment.Labour activists last week said Myan Mode - a Yangon factory that supplies to retailers such as Mango and Zara - had agreed to rehire 25 unionised workers it fired in March when it let go 751 staff - including all 520 members of the factory’s union.The factory has also agreed in principle to rehire hundreds of other fired union members when business picks up as the pandemic eases, according to the Solidarity Centre.Myan Mode could not be reached for comment.“It’s a mild victory but it’s remarkable how hard the brands fought against what is a very clear case of union busting,�� said Andrew Tillet-Saks, a labour campaigner based in Myanmar, criticising brands for being slow to take action on the issue.“It’s clear that the brands hold leverage,�� he added. “The fact that they don’t step in immediately shows that their commitments to sustainability in the supply chain are nonsense.��	-4.610335089
SEOUL, April 23 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hyundai Motor plans to start making the gasoline-electric hybrid version of its new Sonata sedan in China starting late this year, seeking to drive sales of environmentally friendly cars in the world’s biggest car market.This would be its first hybrid car to be produced overseas, a Hyundai Motor spokeswoman said on Thursday. Sonata hybrids being sold in the United States and other markets are currently made in South Korea.Segment leader Toyota Motor Corp and local China brands such as Geely are embracing conventional hybrid cars, even though the technology does not receive as generous an incentives from Beijing as all-electric cars and heavily electrified plug-in hybrids.Toyota, which already assembles the Prius and Camry hybrids in China with component and system kits brought in from Japan, last year announced a plan to start sales of Corolla and Levin models equipped with China-produced major hybrid components in 2015. Honda Motor plans to start making hybrid cars in China by 2016.Last year, Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp said they would triple their number of green vehicles by 2020 as part of efforts to raise fuel economy by 25 percent by that year and address investor concerns about the pair’s lack of green credentials.	-2.485659656
DETROIT, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Connecting a mobile phone and giving voice commands are still causing drivers problems, but new technology features will be highly desirable to buyers when they make their next new vehicle purchase, according to a study of auto dependability released on Wednesday.Looks and exterior design are still the top reasons why people avoid buying a certain model, J.D. Power said. But if a car, truck of SUV does not have the latest technology, 15 percent said they would not buy it, up from only 4 percent last year.The annual J.D. Power study is one of several that taken together show that certain brands -- Lexus, Toyota and of late, General Motors�� Buick and Chevrolet brands -- are getting consistently high marks, while others consistently struggle to get above average despite quality control effortsLexus, the luxury brand from Toyota Motor Corp, scored the highest for the fourth straight year in the J.D. Power study.On Tuesday, the influential Consumer Reports magazine rated Lexus the best brand in the U.S. market for the third straight year.In both studies, General Motors Co’s Buick made big moves upward, finishing second in the J.D. Power survey and becoming the first U.S. brand to be in the top 10 of the Consumer Reports brand report card.Joining Buick in the top 10 in J.D. Power study were GM’s Cadillac at fourth, with Chevrolet and GMC tied for 10th. There were 31 brands ranked.“GM has improved relative to the industry average for seven straight years.�� said Dave Sargent, vice president of Global Automotive Research at J.D. Power.He said Buick still has a “relatively older owner profile�� of buyers who look after their cars and are more apt to go to dealers, where they can be helped with adapting to new technologies.Ford Motor Co has been more aggressive introducing technologies such as voice controls, and its namesake brand fell to 25th from 17th last year and 13th in 2013. Ford says its newer systems are easier to use.The Toyota brand, Honda and Volkswagen AG’s Porsche rounded out the top half-dozen brands.Two consistently low-scoring brands were at the bottom of the J.D.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli high-tech firm Cortica has partnered with some leading players in the automotive industry to form an artificial intelligence venture for autonomous driving, the company said on Wednesday.Given the shift toward self-driving cars, many in the industry are looking to incorporate AI into their systems to better deal with road hazards and increase safety.Partners in the new Tel Aviv-based spinoff, called Cartica AI, include venture capital units at Toyota and BMW, auto supplier Continental AG, as well as Israeli investment platform OurCrowd.The companies did not disclose how much they invested in Cartica AI, but they will help with development and distribution.Cartica AI said that unlike more conventional AI systems, it does not use human-labeled data for deep learning, which is time consuming, expensive and at times unreliable.Instead, it said its AI engine sifts through millions of unlabeled videos, finding common elements to make decisions on how best to react on the road, without human intervention.	-0.2119606359
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, in its second-largest recall announcement, said on Wednesday that it would call back 6.39 million vehicles globally, and analysts saw automakers increasingly turning to recalls rather than risk bad publicity or legal costs.Rival General Motors Co is in the midst of its own recall of 2.6 million cars related to an ignition switch problem, which has been linked to at least 13 deaths.Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker said, it was not aware of any crashes or injuries caused by the glitches, which were found in 27 Toyota models including the RAV4 and Yaris subcompact. It uncovered five different faults involving parts ranging from steering to seats.Toyota said problems were also found in the Pontiac Vibe and the Subaru Trezia, two models the automaker built for General Motors GM.N and Fuji Heavy Industries 7270.T.The automaker did not say how much the recalls would cost, and it was not clear if the faults stemmed from Toyota’s suppliers or its manufacturing process.The move by Toyota to announce five different recalls on a single day from Tokyo comes as major automakers face increasing scrutiny in the United States on how quickly they take preventive safety action and how quickly they share information with regulators and the public.Toyota agreed last month to pay $1.2 billion to the U.S. government for withholding information related to unintended acceleration in its vehicles. That safety crisis had caused Toyota to recall more than 9 million vehicles.“The negative publicity is causing automakers to react faster,�� said Dennis Virag, president of the Automotive Consulting Group. “The harm done to Toyota and GM is significant. Others don’t want to suffer the same fate.”For a graphic of U.S. recalls see: (link.reuters.com/qyg48v)General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra was grilled by Congress last week on her company’s late response to the ignition switch issue.Morningstar analyst David Whiston said that costs of recalls can pale in comparison to potential fines and other legal costs.“The latest Toyota recall is a preventative measure. There have been no fatalities, but recalling the vehicles now will not lead to months of headlines, congressional hearings and fines from the Department of Justice,�� he said.In the largest of the recalls announced on Wednesday, Toyota said some 3.5 million vehicles were being recalled to replace a spiral cable that could be damaged when the steering wheel is turned. That could cause the air bag to fail in the event of a crash, the automaker said.In total, about 2.34 million of the vehicles to be recalled were sold in North America. Another 810,000 were sold in Europe.In the second-largest of the Toyota recalls, some 2.32 million three-door models made between January 2005 and August 2010 are being recalled to check for a fault in the seat rails that could cause the seat to slide forward in a crash, risking injury for the driver or passengers.The other recalls are for faulty steering column brackets, windshield wiper motors and engine starters.The recall announcement, which came during late afternoon Tokyo trade, knocked an additional 2 percent off Toyota’s already sagging shares.They quickly pared the extra losses, however, and ended down 3 percent at 5,450 yen, reflecting an overall weak tone in the market where the benchmark Nikkei average .N225 fell 2.1 percent.Toyota’s 6.39 million vehicle recall is the largest announced on a single day for the company since October 2012, when it called back 7.43 million Yaris, Corolla and other models to fix faulty power window switches.In the first two months of 2014, major automakers had announced 18 separate recalls in the United States, now the second-largest auto market behind China, according to the latest data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The recent wave of large-scale recalls represents a source of revenue for auto dealers who are paid by manufacturers to service defective cars.	5.6291711
PARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen on Tuesday unveiled a pioneering hybrid vehicle concept combining a conventional engine with compressed nitrogen propulsion which it said would halve the cost of cutting emissions compared with current petrol-electric hybrids.The French carmaker said the so-called “Hybrid Air�� system developed with auto parts supplier Robert Bosch would be lighter than a hybrid running on petrol and battery power.Peugeot, which is cutting more than 10,000 jobs as it struggles to stem losses and expand overseas, said the technology would be launched around 2016, with vehicles priced below 20,000 euros ($26,600).“The cost per gram of CO2 reduction is going to be very competitive,�� Bosch automotive chief Bernd Bohr told reporters at a press conference outside Paris on Tuesday.Unlike Toyota’s Prius hybrid, which supplements a conventional engine with an electric motor, the new Peugeot will use a separate hydraulic motor driven by nitrogen compressed by energy from braking and deceleration.In city driving conditions, the vehicles can travel on the compressed gas power as much as 80 percent of the time with the three-cylinder petrol engine cut, Peugeot said.Peugeot said a prototype Hybrid Air subcompact emitted 72 grams of CO2 per km, compared with 104 grams for a Peugeot 208 model with the same combustion engine.Peugeot aims to price subcompact vehicles with the new technology below 20,000 euros, development chief Guillaume Faury said. The similarly sized Toyota Yaris hybrid has a starting price of around 18,500 euros in France, excluding any environment-related discounts.Faury declined to give detailed cost estimates but said the new transmission would cut the cost per gram of CO2 saved by half when compared with equivalent petrol-electric hybrids.He said the new power unit weighed 100 kg, about half that of other typical hybrids.Unspecified technical challenges have yet to be overcome before a commercial launch, Bosch’s Bohr said.“Some more work will have to be done before these cars find the mass market,�� he said.European hybrid sales rose about 50 percent last year, according to Peugeot data, even as the region’s overall auto market shrank to a 17-year low.Peugeot’s existing diesel-electric hybrids claimed a 16 percent share of that market, with leader Toyota claiming 70 percent.

* Annual auto sales pace in Feb hit 15.38 mln -Autodata* Angst over possible US budget cuts kept mostly in check* GM’s February U.S. sales beat estimates; Ford lags* Chrysler US Feb sales up 4 pct, Toyota up 4.3 pctBy Deepa Seetharaman and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales rose nearly 4 percent in February, delivering a better-than-expected performance as strength in the U.S. housing market tempered worries over the wave of U.S. federal spending cuts due to begin on Friday.The annual U.S. auto sales pace for February was 15.38 million vehicles, according to Autodata, better than the 15.1 million rate expected by economists polled by Thomson Reuters.This marked the fourth month in a row that the sales pace held above the 15 million-vehicle mark, a sign that rising home values are helping American consumers feel more confident about buying a new vehicle.“The escalator is heading up and not down,�� said Kurt McNeil, head of U.S. sales operations for General Motors Co , which posted a better-than-expected sales gain.This boost in housing comes at a time when the average vehicle on the road is at an all-time high of more than 11 years old and pushing past the point of repair.Increased housing construction helped boost sales of pickup trucks during the month. GM’s truck sales to small business owners were up 40 percent, giving a “strong vote of confidence in the underlying economy,�� McNeil said.GM, the largest U.S. automaker, posted a nearly 30 percent jump in sales of its Chevrolet Silverado trucks, while Ford Motor Co’s F-Series gained 15.3 percent.Improvements in the housing market and pent-up demand for new vehicles offset the risks posed to the broader economy by the across-the-board “sequestration�� U.S. budget cuts, Ford and GM executives said during conference calls on Friday.U.S. consumers are showing “nerves of steel�� in the face of the budget cuts, Ford Chief Economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick said, adding that the cuts would lop off about a half a percentage point from GDP growth if fully realized.Auto sales each month are an early indicator of economic health. The auto industry is in the midst of its fourth year of recovery from an economic downturn that pushed GM and its smaller U.S. rival, Chrysler Group LLC, into bankruptcy in 2009.GM’s U.S. sales rose 7 percent in February to 224,314 cars and trucks, while Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, saw sales rise 9 percent to a weaker-than-expected 195,822 vehicles.U.S. auto sales in 2012 rose more than 13 percent to 14.5 million cars and trucks. Sales rose 14 percent in January to an annual sales rate of 15.3 million.Like January, February is typically a slow sales month for the industry, so a small change in sales can have a large impact on the annual rate for the month.Sales at Chrysler, majority-owned by Italy’s Fiat SpA , rose 4 percent to 139,015 vehicles, slightly less than some analysts expected.Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan Motor Co Ltd each posted weaker-than-expected sales last month. Toyota’s sales rose 4.3 percent, while Honda fell 2 percent and Nissan dropped 6.6 percent.GM shares closed 6 cents higher at $27.21 and Ford shares were unchanged at $12.61 on Friday.	-1.190941039

15. Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen aus der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus:GOLDMAN SACHS - New York: Die US-Investmentfirma Berkshire Hathaway der Investorenlegende Warren Buffett hat ihre Beteiligung an der Großbank Goldman Sachs deutlich verringert. Aus einer offiziellen Mitteilung der Firma, die das Porfolio per 31. März aufzeigt, geht hervor, dass Berkshire ihren Anteil an dem Geldaus um 84 Prozent auf rund 1,9 Millionen Aktien von zwölf Millionen Aktien drei Monate zuvor reduziert hat. Der Marktwert der Goldman-Investition fiel auf rund 297 Millionen Dollar von etwa 2,76 Milliarden Dollar. Zudem stieg Berkshire aus dem Versicherer Travelers und dem Ölunternehmen Phillips 66 aus. Berkshire Hathaway ist an etwa 90 Firmen unterschiedlichster Branchen beteiligt. Die Firma hält etwa Anteile an Apple, Coca-Cola sowie dem Ketchup-Hersteller Kraft Heinz.USA/DAIMLER - Der Autobauer wird in seinem US-Werk in Alabama in der kommenden Woche nichts produzieren können. Grund seien fehlende Zuliefer-Teile, erklärte der Konzern am Freitag. Insidern zufolge liegt das an fehlenden Teilen aus Mexiko, wo die Zulieferer ihre Produktion noch nicht wieder aufgenommen haben. Daimler hatte das Werk Ende April nach der Corona-Krise wieder hochgefahren.FACEBOOK - Das Online-Netzwerk kauft das US-Unternehmen Giphy, das auf animierte Bilder (GIFs) im Netz spezialisiert ist. Giphy solle Teil der Facebook-Tochter Instagram werden, teilte der Konzern am Freitag mit. Finanzielle Details des Vorhabens wurden nicht genannt. Der Nachrichtendienst Axios sprach allerdings von etwa 400 Millionen Dollar, die als Kaufpreis im Raum stünden.FRESENIUS - Frankfurt: Der Gesundheitskonzern rechnet im Zusammenhang mit der Virus-Krise mit keinen größeren Einbußen. “Insgesamt bleibe ich dabei: Die eine oder andere Schramme werden wir noch abbekommen��, sagte Konzernchef Stephan Sturm der “FAZ�� laut Vorabbericht. “Größere finanzielle Einbußen sollten uns aber erspart bleiben. Wir werden diese Krise gut meistern.�� In China sehe er mittlerweile eine weitgehende Normalisierung. “In unseren Werken produzieren wir wieder voll. Auch die Logistik innerhalb des Landes hat sehr zügig Fortschritte gemacht.�� In Amerika, wo Fresenius mit der Tochter Fresenius Medical Care stark vertreten ist, sieht er positive Anzeichen. “Inzwischen ist meine Wahrnehmung, dass wir auch in den USA den Scheitelpunkt überschritten haben und darauf hoffen können, dass wir graduell hin zu einer Normalisierung kommen.”VIRGIN ATLANTIC - London: Die Pläne der britischen Regierung, im Land ankommende Reisende mit einer Quarantäne von 14 Tagen zu belegen, erschweren die Lage bei der Airline weiter. Sollte das Vorhaben umgesetzt werden, halte dies Fluggäste fern und Virgin werde frühestens im August den Flugbetrieb wieder aufnehmen, sagte ein Insider aus dem Umfeld des Unternehmens. Ohne Quarantäne könne vielleicht schon im Juli wieder geflogen werden. Der britische Virgin-Besitzer Richard Branson hat - wie viele andere Fluggesellschaften auch - Staatshilfe beantragt, um die Coronakrise mit ihren Reisebeschränkungen zu überstehen.FIAT CHRYSLER - Mailand: Der Autobauer bemüht sich angesichts der Coronakrise einem Insider zufolge um eine milliardenschwere Staatsbürgschaft. Das Unternehmen spreche mit der italienischen Großbank Intesa Sanpaolo über einen vom Staat garantierten Kredit im Volumen von 6,3 Milliarden Euro, sagte eine mit dem Vorgang vertraute Person Reuters. Fiat Chrysler und die Bank lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab.VF CORP - Bangalore: Der US-Hersteller von Vans-Schuhen und Timberland-Stiefeln rechnet wegen der durch das Coronavirus verursachten Ladenschließungen im laufenden Quartal mit Umsatzeinbußen von mehr als der Hälfte. “In den ersten zehn Monaten des Fiskaljahres 2019/2020 hat unser Unternehmen Ergebnisse erzielt, die über unseren langfristigen Wachstumszielen liegen. Dann veränderte sich die Welt für uns alle wegen COVID-19��, sagte VF-Corp-Chef Steve Rendle. Davon seien auch die Lieferanten betroffen, ferner würden viele Werke mit reduzierter Kapazität arbeiten. Für das im März beendete vierte Quartal des Geschäftsjahres 2019/20 meldete das in Denver, Colorado, ansässige Unternehmen einen Nettoverlust von 483,8 Millionen Dollar, verglichen mit einem Gewinn von 128,8 Millionen Dollar im Vorjahreszeitraum. Der Nettoumsatz sank um etwa zwei Prozent auf 2,1 Milliarden Dollar und lag damit unter den Analysten-Schätzung von 2,28 Milliarden Dollar. VF-Corp gab keinen Ausblick auf das aktuelle Geschäftsjahr 2020/2021.TOYOTA - Tokio: Der japanische Autobauer plant wegen der Coronavirus-Krise seine heimische Produktion im Juni zu reduzieren. Wegen der geringeren Nachfrage nach Neuwagen werde der Konzern nun 122.000 Einheiten weniger herstellen, teilte Toyota mit. Dies entspreche einer 40-prozentigen Kürzung gegenüber den bisherigen Prognosen für den Monat Juni.BMW - München: Der Autobauer beginnt mit der angekündigten Herstellung von Atemschutzmasken in Deutschland. Zwei vollautomatische Anlagen produzieren im Werk Wackersdorf bei Regensburg täglich insgesamt bis zu 200.000 Mund-Nase-Masken, mit denen sich BMW-Mitarbeiter vor dem Coronavirus schützen sollen. Spezialmaschinen und Rohmaterial stammen ebenfalls aus Bayern. Die Maschinen lieferte der zum chinesischen Autozulieferer Ningbo Joyson Electronic gehörende deutsche Hersteller PIA Automation. Vliesstoffe kommen vom bayerischen Textilkonzern Sandler. Die Bundesregierung will die heimische Produktion von Masken und weiterer medizinischer Ausrüstung ankurbeln.OTTOBOCK �� Danzig: Das Medizintechnikunternehmen hat im vergangenen Jahr erstmals einen Jahresumsatz von mehr als einer Milliarde Euro erzielt. Der Umsatz kletterte 2019 um 8,2 Prozent auf 1,003 Milliarden Euro, wie Ottobock mitteilte. Der bereinigte operative Gewinn (Ebitda) stieg um zehn Prozent auf 191 Millionen Euro. Damit verbesserte sich die Ebitda-Marge auf 19,2 Prozent. “Im nächsten Schritt wollen wir ein Niveau von 20 Prozent erreichen��, sagte Finanzchef Jörg Wahlers. Für 2020 habe Ottobock das Wachstumstempo eigentlich steigern wollen, doch die Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise auf die Geschäftszahlen seien noch nicht abschätzbar, sagte Firmenchef Philipp Schulte-Noelle. “In den ersten Monaten waren wir voll auf Kurs, diese Ziele zu erreichen.�� Sobald sich die Situation normalisiert habe, rechne das Unternehmen mit Nachholeffekten.FOXCONN - Taipeh: Der Gewinn des taiwanischen Elektronikherstellers ist im ersten Quartal um fast 90 Prozent eingebrochen. Der Nettogewinn von Foxconn - früher Hon Hai Precision - rutschte auf 2,1 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar (rund 65 Millionen Euro), da die Corona-Pandemie die Nachfrage von Apple und anderen Großkunden drückte, wie Foxconn mitteilte. Dies liegt deutlich unter den Analystenschätzungen von 8,88 Milliarden Taiwan-Dollar. Der Konzern erwartet jedoch ein zweistelliges Umsatzwachstum im zweiten Quartal, da die Produktion in China wieder hochgefahren ist. “Hon Hai wird sich im zweiten Quartal stabilisieren��, erklärte der Konzern.FORTUM/UNIPER - Helsinki: Der finnische Energieversorger Fortum hat im ersten Quartal weniger verdient. Der operative Gewinn schrumpfte um vier Prozent auf 393 Millionen Euro, lag damit aber noch über den Erwartungen der Analysten. Der Mehrheitseigentümer des Düsseldorfer Versorgers Uniper konnte Einbußen durch niedrigere Strompreise weitgehend durch Absicherungsgeschäfte ausgleichen. Fortum bekräftigte, im Laufe des Jahres mit Uniper eine gemeinsame Strategie zu entwickeln.WÜSTENROT &amp; WÜRTTEMBERGISCHE (W&amp;W) - München: Der Gewinn des Bauspar- und Versicherungskonzerns ist wegen des Abschwungs an den Kapitalmärkten in der Coronakrise im ersten Quartal um zwei Drittel eingebrochen. Das Nettoergebnis sei auf 25,0 (78,5) Millionen Euro gesunken, teilte W&amp;W mit. Grund dafür war ein negatives Finanzergebnis. Die Pandemie zeigte sich vor allem bei der Bausparkasse Wüstenrot, deren Brutto-Neugeschäft um 13 Prozent einbrach. Damit habe sie aber noch Marktanteile gewonnen, erklärte W&amp;W. Die Gewinnprognose für 2020 hatte der Konzern bereits Anfang Mai gekappt.CATHAY PACIFIC - Sydney: Die Fluggesellschaft bezeichnet ihre Aussichten wegen der Coronavirus-Pandemie als “sehr düster��. Die Passagierzahlen von Cathay Pacific brachen im April um 99,6 Prozent ein. “Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt sehen wir noch keine unmittelbaren Anzeichen für eine Verbesserung��, sagte Ronald Lam, Manager bei Cathay Pacific. Das Hongkonger Unternehmen verbuchte im Zeitraum Januar bis April einen ungeprüften Verlust von 4,5 Milliarden Hongkong-Dollar (537,1 Millionen Euro).GEA - Düsseldorf: Der für die Nahrungsmittel- und Getränkeindustrie produzierende Anlagenbauer hat bislang keine größeren Auswirkungen der Coronakrise zu spüren bekommen. So stieg der Auftragseingang um 16 Prozent auf 1,38 Milliarden Euro und markierte damit eine Bestmarke für ein erstes Quartal. Bei einem Umsatzplus um 3,5 Prozent auf 1,09 Milliarden Euro stieg das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) vor Restrukturierungsaufwand um 40,7 Prozent auf 105 Millionen Euro. “Gea ist sehr gut in das Geschäftsjahr 2020 gestartet. Auch wenn die Dauer und damit die finanziellen Auswirkungen von Covid-19 nur schwer abzuschätzen sind, halten wir an unserem Ausblick für 2020 fest��, betonte Vorstandschef Stefan Klebert.AURUBIS - Düsseldorf: Der Kupferkonzern ist dank gestiegener Preise im ersten Halbjahr des Bilanzjahres 2019/20 trotz der Coronakrise noch glimpflich davon gekommen. Bei einem Umsatzanstieg auf 6,013 (Vorjahr: 5,7) Milliarden Euro schrumpfte das Vorsteuerergebnis auf 91 (103) Millionen Euro. “Angesichts der Covid-19-Pandemie haben wir Aurubis bisher gut durch die Krise gesteuert��, erklärte Vorstandschef Roland Harings. Er bekräftigte daher seine Jahresziele.VARTA - Düsseldorf: Wegen der hohen Nachfrage nach Lithium-Ionen-Zellen und dank eines Zukaufs ist der schwäbische Batteriehersteller mit deutlichen Zuwächsen ins Jahr gestartet. Der Umsatz schnellte um rund 170 Prozent auf 198,5 Millionen Euro, ohne Akquisitionen hätte der Zuwachs bei 68,2 Prozent gelegen. Das operative Ergebnis (Ebitda) stieg in den ersten drei Monaten um 197 Prozent auf 51,7 Millionen Euro, bereinigt um 135 Prozent. Der Vorstand bekräftigte seine Prognose für 2020, die einen Umsatz zwischen 780 und 800 Millionen Euro vorsieht, ein Wachstum zwischen 115 und 120 Prozent.OFFICE DEPOT - Bangalore: Der US-Büroartikelhersteller kündigt die Streichung von rund 13.100 Arbeitsplätzen und die Schließung von Filialen an. Die Maßnahmen sollen bis Ende 2023 umgesetzt werden und zu Nettoeinsparungen von 860 Millionen Dollar führen, wie das Management bekanntgab. Zugleich werden durch den Abbau Belastungen von bis zu 543 Millionen Dollar erwartet. Office Depot will sich künftig stärker auf sein Geschäft mit IT-Dienstleistungen konzentrieren.OMV - Wien: Beim Wiener Erdöl- und Gaskonzern werden die Reiseausgaben von Vorstandschef Rainer Seele und die Sponsoring-Aktivitäten des Unternehmens unter die Lupe genommen. Eine entsprechende Prüfung ordnete der Aufsichtsrat an, wie dessen Vorsitzender Wolfgang Berndt mitteilte. Hintergrund ist ein Bericht der Onlineplattform dossier.at. Diesem zufolge zahlte OMV für Seeles Nutzung von Privatflugzeugen seit 2016 insgesamt 400.000 Euro. Die Sponsorenvereinbarung mit dem Fußballclub Zenit St. Petersburg, dem angeblichen Lieblingsteam des russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin, habe 25 Millionen Euro gekostet. Aufsichtsratschef Berndt sagte der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters, Seeles und seine eigenen Reiseausgaben von 2017 bis 2019 würden untersucht. Das gelte auch für alle Sponsoringausgaben.NIKE - Bangalore: Der US-Sportartikelhersteller erwartet eine Belastung der Finanzergebnisse im laufenden Geschäftsquartal durch die coronabedingten Filialschließungen rund um den Globus. Das teilte der Adidas- und Puma-Konkurrent am Donnerstag nach US-Börsenschluss mit. Nike fährt zwar sein E-Commerce-Geschäft hoch, um die gestiegenen Internetbestellungen stemmen zu können. Aber je nach Land sind nach Angaben des Managements derzeit nur fünf bis 40 Prozent der Nike-Filialen offen. In mehr als 15 Ländern hat das Unternehmen nach den Schließungen im Zuge der Viruskrise wieder Geschäfte geöffnet, darunter Deutschland, Frankreich, Brasilien und die USA.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian automakers will this week urge the government to lower a proposed sales tax on hybrid vehicles, as they fear the planned rate could make development of the technology unviable, industry sources and executives told Reuters on Monday.Last week, India said it would tax hybrid vehicles at a rate as high as 43 percent under a new unified tax regime set to come into effect from July 1. That would be significantly higher than the prevailing tax of about 29 percent on such cars.India’s auto trade body, whose members include companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Toyota Motor Corp, will push to lower the proposed rate, an industry source involved in the matter said.If the tax is not reconsidered it will essentially make all hybrid cars unviable, R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, the country’s top-selling carmaker, told Reuters.“It would drive hybrids out of the market,�� he said.The higher tax on hybrid vehicles comes at a time when India is designing a new green car policy that incentivises electric vehicles over hybrid and conventional models. This is already worrying some carmakers that have invested in hybrid technology.Bhargava said both electric and hybrid vehicles should be promoted, with buyers allowed to choose.The new tax structure proposes 12 percent tax on electric vehicles, about 28 percent tax on small petrol cars, and a 43 percent tax on luxury vehicles, the same rate as some hybrids.The country’s revenue secretary, Hasmukh Adhia, on Monday clarified that small hybrid vehicles would be taxed at 28 percent whereas large hybrids would be taxed at 43 percent. He did not clarify what would qualify as large hybrids.India’s auto trade body, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), had earlier asked that hybrid and electric cars be taxed 10 percent lower than petrol and diesel cars.Toyota, which sells the Camry hybrid sedan in India, said in a statement the Indian government was being “short-sighted�� by denying strong hybrid vehicles the same benefit as electrics.To achieve cleaner vehicles the government should review the proposed tax structure, said Shekhar Viswanathan, the vice chair at Toyota’s India unit.	-2.396373057
BOSTON (Reuters) - An off-duty Boston police officer was charged on Monday with attacking the driver of an Uber car he had hired in the early hours of Sunday morning, after a dispute about the route, prosecutors said.The officer, 40-year-old Michael Doherty, was accused of assault and battery, as well as violating the driver’s civil rights because he used a racial slur against the driver, the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement.Doherty, who has been placed on paid administrative leave by the Boston Police Department as a result of the incident, was released on $500 bail and ordered to stay away from the driver and not to use the popular ride-booking service.Prosecutors contend that at about 2:30 a.m. on Sunday Doherty argued with the driver, hitting him and then chasing him around his Toyota Prius before jumping into it and driving away after a passerby tried to come to the Uber driver’s aid.Doherty’s attorney, who told local media that his client strongly disputes the county’s account of the incident, did not immediately respond for a request for comment on Monday.South Boston Municipal Court Judge Michael Bolden ordered that the driver’s name not be released to protect his safety.Doherty is a 16-year veteran of the Boston Police Department.	7.895167895
July 25 (Reuters) - New U.S. buyers found premium European cars the most pleasing to both own and drive, according to an annual J.D. Power and Associates�� survey.Porsche, a unit of Germany’s Volkswagen AG , led the rankings, according to Power’s 2012 U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout study (APEAL), the findings of which were released on Wednesday. It was followed by Jaguar, BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Land Rover.The highest-ranking domestic brand was General Motors Co’s Cadillac, which placed eighth, behind Toyota’s Lexus. It was the only U.S. brand to finish in this year’s top 10.The survey measures “how gratifying a new vehicle is to own and drive�� in the first 90 days after purchase or lease, the influential market research firm said.Japanese brands occupied four of the five lowest spots, with the bottom five including Suzuki, Daimler’s Smart, Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota Motor Corp’s Scion.The Audi A8, which topped the large premium car segment, had the highest individual score in the survey, Power said. Three Chevrolet models - the Sonic, the Volt and the Avalanche - were also individual segment winners.The APEAL survey was based on responses from more than 74,000 owners and lessees of 2012 new cars and trucks who were surveyed earlier this year, according to Power, based in Westlake Village, California.Power also conducts an annual Initial Quality Study that measures things gone wrong in the first 90 days of vehicle ownership.	10.09310484
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering temporarily easing quotas designed to boost production of electric cars to help automakers badly bruised by the coronavirus pandemic to revive slumping sales, people familiar with the matter said.Policymakers in the world’s biggest auto market may also delay the implementation of a new emission particle restriction by six months to help the car industry, which has suffered a 79% drop in sales in February and expects a fall of around 10% in the first half of this year.The United States had already planned to relax vehicle emissions rules. President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday completed a rollback of vehicle emissions standards adopted under predecessor Barack Obama. This will require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - much weaker than the 5% increases under the previous regime.“Policymakers acknowledged that automakers are strained to promote electric models when overall demand is slowing. They want the auto industry to recover steadily this year,�� one of the four people familiar with the matter said.Authorities are still reviewing the details of the plan, which has yet to be finalised, sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The review is being discussed with officials at industry and environment ministries as well as automakers and industry bodies.The policy shift comes as Xin Guobin, vice industry minister, said on Monday that China would “make adjustments on new energy vehicles and related policies to further promote the coordinated and healthy development of the automotive industry.”The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment could not immediately be reached for comment.China requires automakers doing business in the country to follow strict rules covering the production of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) as part of a quota system.China hopes NEVs, such as battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, will account for around a quarter of all cars sold in the country in 2025, up sharply from 5% in 2019.As a result carmakers, including Tesla TSLA.O, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, General Motors GM.N, Toyota 7203.T and Geely [GEELY.UL], have increased EV production. But the system has also been criticised for offering few incentives for automakers to improve gasoline cars' efficiency.The change in policy is largely aimed at helping automakers focus on selling more profitable gasoline cars to improve their cash flow. But a small group of companies -- mostly Chinese automakers such as BYD 002594.SZ -- are already making money from electric vehicle sales.The temporary easing of NEV quotas is likely to allow companies to delay new model launches, which have more costly technology than conventional vehicles, and also discourage them from aggressive marketing.China’s vice industry minister Xin said the auto industry still faced great difficulties and challenges.“Even though production has resumed to a relatively high level, it is possible that some enterprises would cut production in the subsequent period due to insufficient market demand and increased inventories,�� he said.To spur demand, China said late on Tuesday that it will extend subsidies for NEV purchases and extend their purchase tax exemption for two years.	2.444406722
PARIS (Reuters) - PSA Group PEUP.PA is in talks to build Toyota-owned 7203.T supplier Aisin's 7259.T automatic gearboxes at one of its own plants, company sources told Reuters, in what would be an early reward for the Peugeot maker's purchase of Opel GM.N.The combined scale of PSA and Opel has added impetus to negotiations with Aisin, the three sources said, helping to overcome the Japanese company’s reservations.The Opel acquisition announced in March, which valued the General Motors business at 2.2 billion euros ($2.44 billion), brings “a larger sales volume and therefore more profitability for an investment��, one source said.PSA currently buys six- and eight-speed Aisin gearboxes made in Japan and China for its Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands. Assembling the six-speed in France would secure a competitive supply, reduce currency risk and help fill its own plants.For Aisin, 34 percent-owned by Toyota and affiliates, it would establish a first European production base amid growing demand for automatic gearboxes, which currently equip about one in five PSA cars sold.Automatics are less popular in Europe than in the United States, but their growth is set to accelerate with tighter emissions rules and demand for electric, hybrid and increasingly automated cars, to which manual gearboxes are unsuited.PSA and Aisin both declined to comment, but Aisin has previously signaled an openness to partnerships.“We’re absolutely not averse to joint programs with non-Toyota companies,�� President Yasumori Ihara said in January, the same month that PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares told workers at his company’s Metz transmissions plant that an unspecified production deal was under consideration.But the proposal had made little headway until the tie-up with Opel, the sources said. An agreement could now be finalised within months, subject to successful closing of the Opel acquisition later in the year, and PSA managers may discuss the plans with unions in works council meetings next month.PSA plans to redevelop future Opels with its own technology - as three models already have been under an earlier partnership - boosting purchasing clout and economies of scale.Bringing production of automatic gearboxes in-house underlines their importance. Under Tavares, PSA has been outsourcing activities including some research and development to prioritize core profitability and future growth areas.One option would be for PSA and Aisin to invest jointly in a new production line at a French site.But PSA-owned production under license is more likely, reflecting the Japanese supplier’s wariness over investing, sources said. That could evolve into a joint venture or outright sale once the plan had proved its worth.Either way, the production investment would pit PSA’s Tremery factory near Metz, eastern France, against the northern Valenciennes plant. While Valenciennes has more automatic gearbox expertise, Metz has more spare capacity.“There’s easily enough room on the Metz site,�� said Christian Lafaye, an official with the Force Ouvriere union. “They can come and install their tooling tomorrow if they want.��	-1.938746839
Sept 4 (Reuters) - Auto sales in Canada rose 0.6% in August from a year earlier, ending a seventeen month long decline, according to industry data released on Wednesday.The country’s auto sales rose to 182,040 units in August from 180,942 units sold a year earlier, according to a report released by DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, a market research firm that tracks the sector.An 8.4% rise in the light truck segment helped offset a continued downward trend in passenger car sales, which fell 18.3%, the report said.“Consumer confidence was lower in August than it has been, which is an important factor with respect to big ticket item purchases. However, we still have interest rates at very attractive levels to perhaps counter-balance lower consumer confidence ratings,�� David Adams, president of Global Automakers of Canada said in a separate report.With an estimated 27.5% jump in sales, Fiat Chrysler Canada is expected to have had the largest sales growth in August. Toyota Canada, the Canadian distributor of Toyota Motor Corp and Lexus vehicles, came third with a 10.4% rise in sales.Though the slight rise in August sales provide some comfort, the overall market is down 4.1% year-to-date. “It is looking more and more like Canada will see a second year in declining new vehicle sales,�� the DesRosiers report noted.

SAO PAULO, Oct 26 (Reuters Point Carbon) - Carmaker Toyota and Mexico’s auto industry have sued the Mexican government to try to block proposed regulations to align the fuel efficiency standard of cars and light trucks with that of the United States to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Toyota last month obtained a federal court injunction to stop the government’s work on Nom-163, a rule that would require the fleet of new cars and light trucks to achieve a fuel economy rate of 14.9 kilometers per liter, or 35 miles per gallon, by 2016.Mexico appealed but the local carmakers association, Amia, joined Toyota in its legal action to block the rule, which would also align the fuel economy standard of Mexico’s new cars with that of Canada.The controversy highlights the resistance by Mexico’s manufacturing sector to the low-carbon regulations introduced in the last few years by the government as the global economy drags and competition increases.The companies allege the proposed standard is too strict and would increase vehicle prices, therefore reducing sales.The government thinks the auto industry is challenging the regulation in order to be able to sell cars in Mexico that it can no longer sell abroad to markets with tougher regulations.Mexico has led a high profile effort to decarbonize its economy, and drew international attention by being one of the few countries to enact comprehensive climate legislation.Although it is a developing country, Mexico has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from business-as-usual levels by 2020.The energy sector accounts for up to 70 percent of Mexico’s emissions and almost 30 percent of that share is transportation-related. Reducing the amount of fuel necessary to move Mexico’s fleet is an important step for the country to reach its target, the government contends.Mexico is the world’s eighth largest car producer, having produced 2.6 million vehicles in 2011, and ranks fifth among the major exporters. The country decided to change its norms for vehicles to harmonize regulations with its North American trade partners.The regulation is based on the United States�� Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) developed by the Obama administration and the top U.S. automakers.Mexico estimates the standard could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 160 million tonnes by 2030.Amia says the government, however, did not include some of the incentives contained in the U.S. regulation, such as credits for production of hybrids and for cars that could run on a mix of ethanol. It also complained that the limit for light trucks�� fuel consumption was changed after the public consultation period ended.The lobby group also argued that the rule should be more flexible than CAFE since central Mexico’s high altitude makes higher fuel efficiency harder to achieve.“Without the flexibilities and with the late change for trucks the new norm will become even stricter than the CAFE regulation,�� Amia said in a statement.“The objective was to suspend the work on the new rule because we could not have a dialogue with the government,�� Ana Maria Vallarino, Toyota’s public relations director in Mexico, told Reuters Point Carbon on Thursday.“Toyota is not against the rule but wants an efficient regulation that benefits the Mexican consumer,�� she said.Sandra Herrera Flores, Mexico’s environment undersecretary and one of the officials working on the new standard, said companies had almost two years to discuss the regulation so a late legal challenge is not justified.“Mexico exports 80 percent of all cars produced locally. From that, 75 percent head to U.S., Canada and Europe, so these vehicles already comply with regulations we are trying to pursue, or even tougher regulations,�� she said.“So, it is hard to understand what is going on. We hope the court decides that the rule is in the public’s interest and allows work to proceed,�� said the official.The government said it is uncertain how long the legal fight with the industry will last.	11.95301407
WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Major automakers including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are asking to intervene in a lawsuit filed by 23 U.S. states last month, the companies said on Monday.The automakers are seeking to intervene on behalf of the Trump administration after California and 22 other states sued in September to undo the Trump administration’s determination that federal law bars California from setting stiff tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.Other automakers including Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Volkswagen AG, which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not joining the effort to intervene.

PARIS, July 23 (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen wants government aid on top of wage concessions as a condition for averting a second French auto plant closure, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.Peugeot, which announced one closure and 8,000 job cuts earlier this month, is seeking tax breaks or other public support for its Sevelnord plant before committing a new vehicle to the northern French factory, according to three people briefed on the demand by company officials.“They told us they were asking for significant government aid,�� one of the sources said.The support could come from national or regional government coffers, according to another.Peugeot declined to comment on whether it had sought public aid for Sevelnord. A government spokeswoman could not be reached for comment.The automaker said on Monday it had reached a deal to build commercial vans for Toyota based on its own models currently assembled at the plant, which employs 2,700 workers.But without improvements in competitiveness including labour concessions, Peugeot reiterated it was unlikely to choose Sevelnord for a future generation of midsize vans needed to keep the plant running.Peugeot is close to an agreement with unions on a labour deal including a two-year pay freeze, reduced leave and more flexible working time, two of the sources said.	12.44176487
WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Three executives of Japan’s Takata Corp will plead guilty to conspiring to fix the price of seatbelts sold to automakers in the United States and will go to jail for 14 to 19 months, the Justice Department said on Thursday.Takata settled with the Justice Department in October, agreeing to pay $71.3 million to settle antitrust charges.Separately, the government indicted two executives from another Japanese company on charges that they conspired to fix the prices of rubber parts sold to Toyota.The three Takata executives in the seatbelt case worked with car makers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Subaru, which is owned by Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Mazda Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co Ltd , all of which purchased Takata seat belts.One of the three executives, Yasuhiko Ueno, had worked for a Takata subsidiary in the United States, TK Holdings Inc, and will serve 19 months in prison, the department said.The other two, Saboro Imamiya and Yoshinobu Fujino, currently work for Takata in Japan. Imamiya will serve 16 months in prison while Fujino will serve 19 months, the department said.In the second case, the Justice Department indicted Japanese nationals Masao Hayashi and Kenya Nonoyama on price-fixing charges involving anti-vibration rubber parts like engine mounts.The department declined to name the company that Hayashi and Nonoyama worked for, saying only that they were employed by an Osaka-based company with subsidiaries in Franklin, Kentucky and White, Georgia.Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Co Ltd is based in Osaka and lists operations in both U.S. cities on its website. Masao Hayashi is named as president of Toyo Automotive Parts (USA) in a 2010 news release. The company could not immediately be reached for comment.The Justice Department and antitrust enforcers worldwide have been probing price fixing of more than 30 car parts, including seatbelts, radiators, windshield wipers, air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components.Other companies which have purchased parts subject to price fixing have been Fiat SpA affiliate Chrysler Group LLC , Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.In some cases, the price-fixing lasted for a decade or longer. Parts company executives typically met face to face or talked by phone to reach collusive agreements, the Justice Department has said.Among the auto parts companies that the Antitrust Division has settled with are Autoliv Inc, Tokai Rika Co Ltd , TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, Nippon Seiki Co Ltd, Furukawa Electric Co Ltd and Fujikura Ltd .	-5.573588789
* Nikkei moves up early on United States-Mexico trade deal* Trade deal helps shares of car and auto-parts makersTOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei breached 23,000 on Tuesday thanks to the United-States-Mexico trade deal, then shed most of the gains on profit-taking but still ended the day at its highest close since mid-June.The Nikkei share average finished the day up 0.1 percent at 22,813.47.The United States and Mexico agreed on Monday to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), putting pressure on Canada to agree to new terms on auto trade and dispute settlement rules to remain part of the three-nation pact.“Investors are relieved on receding trade worries but there are several other factors in the U.S. that are raising sentiment for the Japanese market,�� said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.“The U.S. economy is strong, its corporate earnings are bright while inflation is under control, so the environment is favourable for risky asset investors.”He said one concern is that Japan’s trading volume and turnover have been thin, even though hedge funds are seen buying back Japanese stocks that they sold a few weeks ago.“Unless trade becomes more active, the Nikkei is unlikely to rise and stay above 23,000,�� Fujito said.The broader Topix gained 0.2 percent on Tuesday to 1,731.63. Advancing issues outnumbered decline ones 1,018 to 982.Shares in Japan’s top three automakers, which have plants in Mexico, rose. Toyota Motor Co advanced 0.9 percent, Nissan Motor Co climbed 1.3 percent and Honda Motor Co gained 1.3 percent.Autoparts makers followed suit, with Denso Corp up 2.3 percent, Aisin Seiki gaining 1.2 percent, and Jtekt Corp rising 1.8 percent.Investors also took heart from news that the Toyota group of companies said they would form a joint venture to develop software that manages brakes, steering and other components for automated driving.

TOKYO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average recouped early losses and inched up on Thursday, supported by a weaker yen which helped offset disappointment that the U.S. Federal Reserve is not embarking on a lengthy easing cycle.The Fed on Wednesday lowered rates for the first time since 2008, as widely expected, but Chairman Jerome Powell said the move was not the start of a long series of rate cuts, sending U.S. share markets lower.The Nikkei was up 0.07% at 21,536.54 points as of 0151GMT.The index initially fell as much as 1% but clawed back ground as the yen slid to a two-month low against the dollar after the Fed proved to be less dovish than anticipated.Shares of exporters, which benefit from a weaker yen, advanced. Toyota Motor Corp rose 1.3%, Honda Motor Co edged up 0.9%, Canon Inc added 1% and Nintendo advanced 3.8%.Nomura Holdings soared 8.5% the investment bank said its first-quarter profit soared more than ten-fold after restructuring its portfolio.Another blue chip which made big gains was Takeda Pharmaceutical, which gained 5.8% after its sales in the April-June quarter increased 88.8%.Kao Corporation, on the other hand, fell 3.5% after the cosmetic product maker saw its January-June net profit decline 8.8%.The broader Topix rose 0.15% to 1,567.45.

Allgaier ends 80-race Xfinity droughtBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeAVONDALE, Ariz. -- Justin Allgaier popped a tire during his celebratory burnout after Saturday’s DC Solar 200 at Phoenix International Raceway.But you can forgive the driver of the No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet if he was a trifle rusty with his donuts -- Allgaier hadn’t been to Victory Lane in the NASCAR Xfinity Series since August 2012 at the road course in Montreal.On a blistering afternoon that brought emotions to a boil at the 1-mile race track in the Sonoran Desert, Allgaier sailed away with a magnificent restart with four laps left and finished .741 seconds ahead of runner-up Ryan Blaney, who started 33rd after inspection issues kept him off the grid during qualifying earlier in the day.“You have no idea how proud I am of you,�� Allgaier radioed to his team after he crossed the finish line and broke an 80-race drought.After climbing from the car, Allgaier began to digest what he had just accomplished, not the least of which was claiming the $100,000 bonus in the first Dash 4 Cash race of the season. The victory was Allgaier’s fourth in the series.“Last year was tough,�� Allgaier said of a winless 2016, his first year with JRM. “We had really good runs all year but we weren’t able to get to Victory Lane. This was the same group of guys we had last year, and to be able to do it here in Phoenix and win the first Xfinity Dash 4 Cash race. ...“This is a team effort. We had four really good JR Motorsports hot rods out there.”In fact, with polesitter William Byron running fourth and series leader Elliott Sadler coming home fifth, JRM put three cars in the top five and four in the top nine, with Michael Annett finishing ninth.With 10 laps left, contact from Cole Custer’s Ford sent Austin Dillon’s No. 2 Chevrolet hard into the outside wall, collecting Ryan Sieg’s Chevrolet in the process. After caution flew on lap 191, Dillon rode Custer’s car into the outside wall, earning a summons to the NASCAR hauler for Dillon and crew chief Justin Alexander.“He over-drove the corner and took us out with it,�� Dillon said after exiting the infield care center.Dillon wasn’t particularly apprehensive about the meeting with NASCAR.“We’ll probably just have a Coke and discuss things,�� he said optimistically.Custer took full responsibility for the incident.“It was 100 percent my fault,�� said the Sunoco rookie driver. “I got in there too deep, got really loose going in and couldn’t put any wheel into it. That was pretty much it. Just all my fault. Something that won’t happen again. We had a great race leading up to that.“We didn’t start out at all how we wanted to, but by the end we were probably a fifth- to eighth-place car,�� Custer said. “I thought that was a really good sign for us. I thought we had a really good Haas Automation Ford. It’s unfortunate I cost us and the 2 car there.”Under the circumstances, Custer wasn’t surprised at Dillon’s retaliation.��... I guess you can kind of expect that when he gets taken out,�� Custer said. “I can understand how frustrated he is about it. It is what it is. I will try not to have that happen again.”NASCAR XFINITY Series Race - DC Solar 200Phoenix RacewayAvondale, ArizonaSaturday, March 18, 20171. (5) Justin Allgaier, Chevrolet, 200.2.

(Reuters) - New U.S. buyers found premium European cars the most pleasing to both own and drive, according to an annual J.D. Power and Associates�� survey.Porsche PSHG_p.DE, a unit of Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, led the rankings, according to Power's 2012 U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout study (APEAL), the findings of which were released on Wednesday. It was followed by Jaguar TAMOJL.UL, BMW BMWG.DE, Audi NSUG.DE, Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE and Land Rover.The highest-ranking domestic brand was General Motors Co's GM.N Cadillac, which placed eighth, behind Toyota's Lexus. It was the only U.S. brand to finish in this year's top 10.The survey measures “how gratifying a new vehicle is to own and drive�� in the first 90 days after purchase or lease, the influential market research firm said.Japanese brands occupied four of the five lowest spots, with the bottom five including Suzuki 7269.T, Daimler's Smart, Mitsubishi 7211.T, Subaru 7270.T and Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Scion.The Audi A8, which topped the large premium car segment, had the highest individual score in the survey, Power said. Three Chevrolet models - the Sonic, the Volt and the Avalanche - were also individual segment winners.The APEAL survey was based on responses from more than 74,000 owners and lessees of 2012 new cars and trucks who were surveyed earlier this year, according to Power, based in Westlake Village, California.Power also conducts an annual Initial Quality Study that measures things gone wrong in the first 90 days of vehicle ownership.	10.09310484
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday lifted its 2012 domestic sales forecast to 1.63 million vehicles, up 6.5 percent from its previous prediction and 36 percent higher than 2011, after the government last month decided to re-introduce subsidies for fuel-efficient cars.Toyota is expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of such green car incentives and subsidies thanks to its broad line-up of hybrid vehicles, including the Aqua, its cheapest and most fuel-efficient hybrid to date, launched late last month.The company’s forecast for 18 percent sales growth overseas was unchanged, bringing the global forecast to 8.58 million vehicles, up 21 percent on the previous year, excluding Daihatsu and Hino.That would be a record for the company, whose sales slipped 6 percent to 7.1 million vehicles in 2011, hampered by the massive earthquake in northeast Japan and Thai flooding.	13.90460792

(Adds production expected to resume on Monday, details)TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp on Thursday said it halted production at three of its plants in Japan after an explosion at a plant operated by one of its suppliers disrupted its supply chain.Suzuki, which specialises in compact vehicles, said the stoppage at three of its factories in eastern Japan was due to a shortage of parts from braking products maker Aisin Advics, which reported an explosion at one of its plants earlier this week.The automaker said it would resume production on Monday.Toyota Motor Corp, whose supply chain was also disrupted by the explosion, on Thursday restarted all of its domestic production lines affected by parts shortages, including those at its Motomachi and Takaoka plants in Aichi Prefecture.Aisin Advics is majority owned by Toyota group supplier Aisin Seiki Co.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc opened at a record high on Thursday as Wall Street analysts were encouraged by the company’s better-than-expected quarterly results and delivery targets for the year.Tesla shares, which have been on a tear for the last six months, shot to $643.80 in early trading.The company’s market value of $116 billion eclipses that of Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co combined and is only second to Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp.At least nine analysts raised their price targets on the stock, with Canaccord Genuity’s analyst Jed Dorsheimer raising his price target to $750 from $515.The higher delivery forecast suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and U.S. regulators.Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said that Tesla checks a number of boxes for investors and noted that the key takeaway from the quarter was the company’s promise of comfortably delivering over 500,000 units this year.Tesla, which was infamous for not keeping up with production targets, has been looking to broaden its manufacturing capability with its new $2 billion factory in Shanghai.The electric vehicle maker said its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China.	-4.415154134

(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is recalling about 150,000 Tacoma mid-size pickup trucks from the model years 2001 to 2004 in cold-weather U.S. states because the spare tire could fall off.The spare tire in these Tacoma models is stored beneath the trucks�� bed. When the trucks were made, the metal plate that keeps the spare tire in place was not coated with sufficient amounts of phosphate to retard rust, Toyota said.Over time and in limited cases, corrosion of the plate could cause it to break, causing the detachment of the spare tire, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. said in a statement issued on Wednesday.The 150,000 trucks involved in the recall were initially sold in one of 20 cold-weather U.S. states, Toyota said.Letters will go to the owners of the recalled vehicles in December, Toyota said.Toyota dealers will replace the spare tire assembly, if necessary, without charge to Tacoma owners.	6.50624927
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said Monday it will drop rules first proposed in 2012 that would have required automakers to install brake-throttle override systems to prevent runaway vehicles.The regulation was proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in response to a series of unintended sudden acceleration incidents in Toyota Motor Corp vehicles. It would have required that all motor vehicles�� brakes be able to override the accelerator pedal.The proposal was aimed at ensuring the driver could halt a vehicle by applying the brakes if a throttle pedal was trapped by a floor mat, shoe or other obstruction.In 2012, NHTSA said some automakers had not yet made the systems standard. On Monday NHTSA said all automakers have voluntarily installed brake throttle override systems on all new vehicles and the agency does not anticipate any automakers removing the system.But in dropping the proposed rule, NHTSA will not set braking distance requirements for the systems and other performance requirements.Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Toyota, Volkswagen AG and others, said the rule was no longer necessary.“When the technology is in widespread use now, there is no need to continue a rulemaking,�� she said.Brake throttle override systems work by the vehicle software cutting power to the throttle if both pedals are depressed.NHTSA had also proposed extending its rules to require vehicles to return to idle when a driver stops pressing on the accelerator pedal or in response to a “failsafe operation�� to include electronic throttle control systems.On Monday, NHTSA said a “broader understanding of safe design of vehicle electronic control systems is needed to make an informed decision on regulating return-to-idle.”It said there were “substantial challenges�� in designing objective tests for the operation of brake throttle override systems.The agency in 2012 cited the August 2009 sudden acceleration crash that killed four people when a California Highway Patrol officer was driving a loaner Lexus ES350 that had the wrong floor mat installed.Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles worldwide because of unintended acceleration issues in 2009 and 2010. Several government reviews found no evidence that electronic glitches were to blame for unintended acceleration �� but blamed the issues on mechanical interference like floor mats.In 2014, Toyota paid a $1.2 billion Justice Department fine after it admitted it misled U.S. consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about the extent of sudden acceleration problems.	4.803896867
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, told shareholders on Tuesday he was paid a salary and bonus of 987 million yen ($12.5 million) for the past fiscal year, a package that makes him Japan's highest-paid executive.Ghosn has led Nissan since 2001 and steered the automaker through a turbulent 2011 that saw it bounce back faster than its domestic rivals Toyota Motor Corp7203.T and Honda Motor Co7267.T from disruptions caused by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.Although Ghosn’s 0.5 percent pay rise for the past year put him just short of becoming the first CEO of a Japanese company to be paid more than 1 billion yen, investors have been far more concerned with his tenure than the terms of his compensation.Nissan has justified the higher pay for Ghosn and other Nissan executives by saying they should be compared to compensation packages for CEOs at other big, global industrial companies including Ford Motor Co F.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, rather than the lower pay for Japanese CEOs who tend to have come up through the ranks over a career.“Recruiting and retaining these best and brightest is a competitive advantage that we cannot afford to lose,�� Ghosn told an annual shareholders�� meeting in Yokohama.The disclosed compensation for Ghosn does not include stock options he was granted in the Japanese automaker. Those will be disclosed later this week, a spokesman said.The tally also does not include his compensation as head of Nissan's alliance partner, Renault SA RENA.PA.Nissan said its board had weighed cash compensation for Ghosn against pay for CEOs at other major industrial companies with global operations based on advice from consulting firm Towers Watson.Nissan said the average CEO pay at the industrial companies it had used as a benchmark was $16.1 million, while the average CEO pay for global automakers was $17.5 million.That average included the $29 million paid to Ford CEO Alan Mulally and the $23 million paid to VW’s Martin Winterkorn.Ghosn made another 1.2 million euros ($1.7 million) for heading Renault in 2010. A comparable number for 2011 was not immediately available.Ghosn’s pay at Nissan has topped that of his counterparts at Toyota and Honda by a wide margin. Toyota President Akio Toyoda received 136 million yen ($1.71 million) for the past fiscal year, unchanged from a year earlier.In another point of comparison, Ghosn's pay topped the total compensation for the 21 most senior executives at Sony Corp 6758.T, another Japanese company that had been headed by a foreign CEO.Sony has asked its shareholders to approve payments of just over $10 million for its top executives including newly-appointed CEO Kazuo Hirai, who took over from Howard Stringer.Ghosn, 58, told Reuters on Friday that he was not planning to step down from his post anytime soon, following a Bloomberg report that he would retire before the automaker’s next business plan starts in about five years.	-2.870249017
TOKYO, June 19 (Reuters) - While major automakers race to develop driverless cars, Subaru is taking a slower approach, saying its vehicles may be less advanced than its rivals�� by 2020 as autonomous features remain costly for the buyers of Japan’s smallest carmaker.Automakers such as Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Nissan Motor Co are increasingly looking beyond conventional vehicles to survive in an industry that is moving into electric and self-driving cars.Smaller players are doing the same, but automakers like Subaru with limited research and development resources than their bigger rivals are showing caution in committing to advanced technologies on their own.At a recent demonstration of its driving assist system “Eyesight��, Subaru said its goals for autonomous driving were modest versus bigger rivals, some of which aim for self-driving cars on city streets by 2025.“We’re looking at how to develop (more advanced)capabilities, but we believe such functions will remain beyond the reach of Subaru customers,�� Tetsuo Onuki, chief general manager at Subaru’s technical research centre, said last week in comments for publication on Monday.“We’re not aiming to develop driverless cars. What we’re trying to do is make driving safer for people.”Subaru’s new automated cruise control system can track cars travelling in front at low speeds, building on a similar feature marketed by bigger rival Nissan last year.The automaker has said it will continue to develop automated functions on its own, tapping outside technology as needed.It has plans to start developing an all-battery electric car this year, but it will use technology developed by Toyota Motor in a plug-in hybrid model planned for release in 2018.“The risk Subaru runs with tempering their ambitions is that, if the market wants (more sophisticated technologies) ... and they don’t make it on their own, they’ll have to buy it off the shelf from a supplier,�� CLSA analyst Chris Richter said.He added that an increased dependence on suppliers would leave Subaru with less control over developing new technologies.Other smaller Japanese automakers have also acknowledged the challenges of competing with bigger rivals on advanced technologies given their relatively limited budgets.Mazda Motor Corp has yet to announce plans to develop self-driving cars, while it will draw on its partnership with Toyota to develop electric cars.Mitsubishi Motors Corp has said its takeover by Nissan last year had given it access to Nissan’s automated driving technology, something it had lacked the resources to pursue on its own.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T U.S. executive Jim Lentz said consumers purchasing new vehicles to replace those lost during Superstorm Sandy will mean strong November U.S. auto sales.On a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, November U.S. sales will be between 14.8 million and 15.2 million new vehicles, said Lentz, president and chief executive of Toyota Motor Sales, USA.Lentz, speaking on the sidelines of a JD Power &amp; Associates and National Automobile Dealers Association conference, said Toyota believes 400,000 cars and trucks were destroyed by Sandy, and that 100,000 of those were new vehicles.	8.17765245

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T nudged its full-year net profit forecast up to $9.7 billion, even as it put the cost of recent anti-Japanese protests and a slowing economy in China, the world's biggest autos market, at lost sales of 200,000 cars.Sales at Toyota and its two Chinese joint ventures almost halved in September and October amid often violent protests in a dispute over ownership of islets in the East China Sea. Honda Motor's 7267.T China car sales more than halved last month, while Nissan Motor's 7201.T fell 41 percent.Toyota said on Monday the impact of the drop in sales would cost it 30 billion yen off its full-year net profit. It sold around 900,000 vehicles in China last year.While Honda last week cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth to take account of the China damage, and Nissan is expected to follow suit when it releases its July-September results on Tuesday, Toyota has found room to revise its forecasts higher as it traditionally gives more conservative earnings guidance and relies less heavily on China sales.China accounts for around 12 percent of Toyota's sales, compared to Nissan's 27 percent and Honda's 20 percent. The backlash in China against Japanese goods allowed Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and BMW BMWG.DE to pick up market share.Toyota increased its net profit forecast for the year to end-March to 780 billion yen, up 2.6 percent from its previous guidance. It said full-year operating profit would be 1.05 trillion yen, up a touch from its earlier forecast for 1 trillion yen.July-September net profit more than trebled to 257.9 billion yen ($3.2 billion) on solid sales in North America and Southeast Asia, beating an average estimate of 228.8 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year ago, Japanese manufacturers were still reeling from the March earthquake and tsunami.“It’s uncertain when sales will recover in China. It’s unlikely to happen anytime soon ... I think the market hopes for a recovery in January-March, but I don’t really see what’s going to drive that,�� said Kei Nihonyanagi, autos analyst at Barclays Securities in Tokyo.In its biggest market, the United States, Toyota’s sales rose 16 percent in October from a year ago, giving it and its Lexus luxury brand a 13.9 percent market share, up from 12.3 percent. Toyota said it hopes to sell 2 million vehicles in the United States, a market it sees growing to 14 million vehicles.The Camry was the third-best selling vehicle in the United States in October after Ford's F.N F-Series pickup truck and GM's GM.N Chevy Silverado, and led the mid-sized family sedan category ahead of Honda's Accord and Nissan's Altima.Toyota and its group companies sold a total of 7.4 million vehicles worldwide in January-September, beating GM and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE to be the top selling carmaker. Toyota was the world's biggest automaker from 2008 through 2010, and could this year regain top slot after recovering from a series of crises - from the global financial meltdown and damaging recalls to natural disasters and the China row.Toyota on Monday trimmed its forecast for global sales in the year to end-March - excluding those at its Chinese joint ventures - to 8.75 million vehicles from a previous 8.8 million.Shares in Toyota, valued at nearly $135 billion - almost as much as Honda, Nissan and Hyundai combined - are up by a quarter this year, easily outpacing Honda’s 4.5 percent gain, while Nissan is flat. Ahead of Monday’s results, Toyota rose 2.2 percent to their highest close in 6 weeks.Toyota, which blazed a trail for mass producing quality cars but then tripped up by expanding too fast into the U.S. muscular SUV and truck market at a time when the yen, too, was rising, has been on a relentless cost-paring binge. Investors now want to see real signs that Toyota is fixing its core problem. As the company’s president Akio Toyoda puts it: having to make “ever-better cars��.Satoshi Ozawa, an executive vice president, said Toyota expects further cost cuts during the current second half, and predicts a 300 billion yen improvement in profits from the cuts.While Toyota is again making money, profitability in its core car business is much lower than its financial services unit, which brings in just 5 percent of revenue, but a quarter of operating profit.“We are changing a lot from what we were. We want to prove how we have changed through our products, and we want to ask everyone to wait a little bit more,�� another vice president, Mitsuhisa Kato, said in August.“It’s tough for Toyota to dominate the market again with its current product line-up. It needs to improve overall product attractiveness, including design and ride quality,�� said Masatoshi Nishimoto, autos analyst at IHS Automotive in Tokyo.One sign of change is Toyota’s more controversial designs tested on recent models. For example: the “spindle grille�� on some luxury Lexus models - a prominent grille pinched in the middle - gives the car a bolder, more aggressive look.“We are starting to think about how we can produce cars that stand out, rather than cars that are accepted by everyone but have no unique identity,�� said Toyota designer Ryo Ikeda.Another is the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), a new framework to build better cars and cut costs by developing multiple models simultaneously to use more common parts. Shared parts mean suppliers can produce a larger number of fewer parts, cutting the unit price. The framework focuses on three platforms, each carrying 8-10 models, Toyota employees said.The first car to be fully developed by the TNGA will be the revamped Prius for late-2014 release, followed by the subcompact Vitz and the next generation Camry around 2016, analysts said.As the global market evolves, Toyota is looking to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets, and plans to double its China sales to 1.8 million cars by 2015. It has positioned Southeast Asia as a “second mother-base�� after Japan.	4.818684696
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s truck-making arm is adding artificial intelligence to large diesel-electric hybrids to improve fuel efficiency, at a time when rivals are focusing on all-battery-powered models in an era of tighter emissions rules.The development comes as the market for trucks and other heavy equipment, as with passenger cars, is disrupted by new technology such as electrification and automated driving.Rival Mitsubishi Fuso, owned by Daimler AG, began selling an all-electric version of its small Canter trucks last year, while U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc is expanding into trucks with plans for a heavy-duty model by 2019.Toyota’s Hino Motors Ltd, however, is taking a more incremental approach, expanding its hybrid lineup to larger models rather than jumping to full electrification.It plans to launch a system in Japan in mid-2019 using GPS and gyro sensors, which sense rotational motion, to assess the best way to manage the power system of its Profia trucks - its largest diesel-hybrid models, marketed abroad as the 700 series.Along with existing automatic cruise-control technology, the system calculates ways to limit the impact of tailgating and other driving habits which can reduce mileage, improving fuel economy by 15 percent over diesel-only counterparts.“Fuel efficiency in large commercial trucks varies significantly given driving habits,�� Executive Vice President Shin Endo told reporters at Hino’s research and development center on the outskirts of Tokyo.“With this system, the vehicle can achieve better mileage regardless of the skill of the driver.”Hino plans to sell all-battery commercial trucks from around 2020, though its lineup initially will likely be limited to smaller models due to batteries�� cost and weight considerations.“The biggest hurdle to achieving affordable, large-scale EV trucks remains battery size, cost and weight,�� Endo said.“We are developing these, but we believe it will take a while,�� Endo said. “We see hybrids becoming the main powertrain used in commercial vehicles by 2030.”Hino is among the world’s 10 biggest truck makers by sales. It sold around 170,000 vehicles last year, the majority in Japan and the rest of Asia where it dominates the market for large commercial vehicles.	-6.669694905
(Adds details from Toyota, analyst comment)* Toyota confirms new Prius fuel economy 40 km per litre* New Prius to go on sale in Japan in December* Analyst: Toyota hybrid could benefit from Volkswagen scandalBy Naomi TajitsuTOKYO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday its new Prius hybrid would be a fifth more fuel efficient than its predecessor, an upgrade the automaker hopes will boost flagging sales of the environmentally friendly model amid a slump in gasoline prices.The new Prius, which will be released in Japan in December before being launched overseas, has a listed mileage of roughly 40 km per litre (94 mpg), an improvement from the current version’s 32.6 km per litre, the company said.The launch, however, comes as petrol prices in the biggest market for the Prius - the United States - are at their lowest in about a decade, pushing consumers to trade in hybrids and electric vehicles in favor of sports utility vehicles.“When you look at it globally, they haven’t taken off as much, but we are looking to increase their profile as an environmentally sound option,�� Chief Engineer Koji Toyoshima told reporters, referring to the model.According to the latest available figures, August Prius sales in the United States fell 24 percent from the same month a year earlier to 17,757 cars. Last year, U.S. Prius sales totaled 207,372 vehicles.The Prius may get a boost from the emissions scandal engulfing competitor Volkswagen’s, diesel cars from drivers seeking alternate, fuel-efficient models, analysts say.“The timing for Toyota in terms of the VW diesel scandal is probably good at least in terms of consumers who are concerned either from the pollution standpoint, or if the favourable tax treatment in euro for diesel goes away,�� CLSA senior research analyst Christopher Richter said.Toyota dominates the gasoline-hybrid car market, manufacturing 8 million of the more than 9 million gasoline-fuelled vehicles on the road globally. Roughly 4 million of those are Priuses.	1.016243232
BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA PEUP.PA has offered to increase the production capacity for Japanese rival Toyota 7203.T in their joint venture in a bid to win EU antitrust okay for its Fiat FCHA.MI deal, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The aim is to sell some light commercial vehicle production capacity to Toyota, one of the sources said. Another source said PSA would sell the vans at close to margin prices.The European Commission is worried that the deal may harm competition in small vans in 14 EU countries and Britain. The car makers earlier on Friday submitted their proposal to the EU competition enforcer.	-2.323358577

TOKYO (Reuters) - When Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T launches its all-battery Lexus next year, the luxury model will be able to drive autonomously on highways, a big step for the Japanese automaker, which has so far trailed rivals in bringing self-driving cars to market.Announced at the Tokyo Motor Show this week, the new Lexus shows how Toyota is putting its research on self-driving technology to work in cars that have limited automation.That strategy comes as more automakers - and even governments - are taking a longer view toward artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving cars, paring back development targets after fatal accidents in Tesla Inc TSLA.O cars have shown the complexity of the technology.Right now, component manufacturers and venture companies working on the technology “are revising their timeline for AI deployment significantly,�� Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama told a small group of reporters this week.While Toyota is using the motor show to tout its push to become a “future mobility company�� showcasing futuristic, AI-based driving companions and miniature delivery robots, on the sidelines, Tomoyama injected a dose of reality about the pace of developing future cars.“Right from the get-go, we figured it’s going to be a time-consuming endeavor,�� he said. “There’s no particular need to rethink the time frame for our AI self-drive technology investment and development.”Toyota next year will release its first so-called “Level 2�� autonomous car, capable of driving itself on the highway, “from entrance to exit, with traffic merging capability,�� Tomoyama said.Other automakers already market “Level 2�� cars, but a growing number are pushing out their schedules to develop future autonomous technologies, citing the high hurdle to clear before enabling cars to perform more driving tasks.Nissan Motor Co 7201.T also has abandoned an earlier in-house target to develop cars which can drive themselves on city streets by 2020. At the moment, its cars are able to drive on highways and park autonomously. To develop the more advanced “Level 3�� hands-free automated driving technology, Nissan will need at least until the late 2020s, Tetsuro Ueda, an expert at Nissan’s mobility service research center, told reporters this month.‘HUGE COMPLEXITIES’German automaker Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE is also grappling with the size of the challenge. “We really thought at the beginning, it would be just maybe next year or so,�� said Aria Etemad, a project manager at Volkswagen Group Research. “But as we dig into that topic, we see huge complexities that we are facing.”Tesla is a notable exception to the cautious view. Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors on Wednesday that Tesla could release software to enable “fully functional full self-driving�� capability by the end of this year.However, Musk qualified that by saying cars would still need to be “supervised�� by a human driver. By the end of next year, Musk said Tesla hopes to release autonomous driving software “reliable enough that you do not need to pay attention��. But he added “acceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction.”It’s not just car manufacturers that are tempering expectations. Singapore, a pioneer for practical testing of autonomous vehicles, has struck a more cautious tone.“We are not in a rush to be the first adopter,�� Khaw Boon Wan, the transport minister, said this week. “I look forward to a larger-scale adoption of AV (Autonomous Vehicle) technology in Singapore, but I think this will not be in the near future.”The comments surprised industry experts who view Singapore as the ideal test bed for driverless vehicles given its wealth, small size and top-notch infrastructure. The city state has even created a test zone for driverless vehicles with traffic lights, bus stops and a rain simulator.“If Singapore is saying this, then maybe other governments will follow suit,�� said Hussein Dia, professor of future urban mobility at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia.“Whatever comes out of Singapore, the world watches and listens,�� he added, referring to its driverless expertise.General Motors Co's GM.N self-driving unit, Cruise, said earlier this year it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as more testing of the vehicles was required.In GM’s case, unexpected technical challenges, including the difficulty for cars to identify whether objects are in motion, are requiring the company to take more time and caution to develop its technology, sources have told Reuters.The Japanese components maker Denso 6902.T, Toyota's biggest supplier, believes it will take years for the technology for fully self-driving cars to hit the roads. For now it is working toward developing cars that can accelerate and brake on their own with driver monitoring. “The most difficult aspect of developing these driving systems is to anticipate unexpected movements in the vehicle’s surroundings,�� said Hajime Kumabe, the head of Denso’s engineering R&amp;D center in Tokyo.	3.035998265
TOKYO (Reuters) - Ryota Kawamata hadn’t driven for more than a decade, but as Japan’s COVID-19 crisis worsened in May, his employer near Tokyo rented him a car so he wouldn’t have to use public transport.The 32-year old engineer, a self-described “poor driver��, now wants to buy his own car.“There are places where I can’t go without a car,�� said Kawamata, who recently paid 30,000 yen ($280) for a five-hour refresher course to hone his driving skills.As Japan emerges from its coronavirus lockdown, restaurants and offices are practicing social distancing, but public transport doesn’t require it. People like Kawamata, known as “paper drivers�� because they have a licence but don’t own vehicles, are an untapped pool of potential car buyers.They could give Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and others a small but much-needed boost amid a global slump in car-buying.Demand from lapsed drivers elsewhere, such as the United States, China and other countries where social distancing has become the norm, could also help soften the coronavirus blow for car makers.There are no statistics about the number of such drivers in Japan, but about 45 million people have gold-class driving licences, issued to people with no traffic violations for at least five years, according to Japan’s National Police Agency. Many of those drivers have simply not been on the road.Akitake Sawamura, who manages a driving school that offers refresher courses to inexperienced drivers, estimates that around two-thirds of gold licence holders are paper drivers, who have become more numerous over the years as more Japanese use public transit.Over the past three decades, car sales in Japan have fallen from a peak of 7.8 million vehicles in 1990 to 5.2 million last year.“There’s been a pick-up in people attending courses since the emergency was declared in April,�� Sawamura said. Recent students, he said, have included a healthcare worker treating COVID-19 cases and an office worker who moved out of Tokyo and bought a car to get around his new town after he began telecommuting.In a sign that the roads may be more crowded, demand for parking, particularly in central Tokyo, has increased during the coronavirus crisis, according to Akippa, a smartphone service that searches for parking spaces.Demand for spaces more than doubled nationwide and jumped by five times in parts of Japan’s capital during the state of emergency declared in April compared with February, before the coronavirus crisis took hold, according to Akippa spokeswoman Ayako Ishikawa.“People are still commuting to work by car and they have been joined by others since the emergency ended,�� Ishikawa said.The government has noticed the increase in drivers but says it is not concerned about congestion or other issues.“The number of vehicles on the roads is currently less than it was before the coronavirus pandemic began. Going forward there will likely be some impact,�� said a roads bureau official at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. “We don’t yet know what that balance will be between new drivers and those not travelling because of teleworking.”Among the people returning to the road is Kawamata’s co-worker, Keisuke Kai, 25, who also drives a rented car to work. He enjoys the convenience, but says he is “hesitant�� about buying a car because of the cost, including parking fees.Dealerships in and around Tokyo hope paper drivers will eventually take that step.“We would welcome any increase in the number of drivers on the road,�� a salesman at a Toyota dealership told Reuters.	-0.3990922607
DETROIT, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand finished on top of the Consumer Reports annual “brand report card�� for the third straight year, the influential U.S. magazine said on Tuesday.Japanese brands took four of the top five places. Mazda Motor Corp was second and the best finisher among non-luxury brands. Toyota came in third, followed by Volkswagen AG’s Audi from Germany and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd’s Subaru from Japan.For the first time, a U.S. brand made the top 10. General Motor Co’s Buick came in seventh, just behind VW’s Porsche.“Today, many domestic models can go toe-to-toe with the best imports,�� said Jake Fisher, director of automotive testing at Consumer Reports.For the second year in a row, Tesla Motors Inc’s Model S was named the best model overall.The Audi A6 was named the best luxury car for the third straight year.The Subaru Forester was named the top small SUV, and the Toyota Highlander the top mid-sized SUV.The Chevrolet Impala from GM was named best large sedan.Consumer Reports subscribers rated 1.1 million vehicles in the annual auto survey. The results come from those ratings, along with U.S. government and insurance industry safety tests and road tests by the magazine’s staff.No pickup truck was named as best. Last year’s winner, the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Ram 1500, was not reliable enough, Consumer Reports said, and the best-selling model in the United States, Ford Motor Co’s F-150, is too new to have a testing record. Consumer Reports also judged the GM Chevrolet Silverado as unreliable and the Chevrolet Colorado as too new for testing results.Of all the brands in the survey, Buick had the greatest percentage of its models “recommended�� for purchase, at 83 percent. No other U.S. brand had even half of its models recommended.Lexus got “recommended�� ratings for 78 percent of its models tested, compared with Mazda, 67 percent; Toyota, 68 percent; Audi, 56 percent; and Subaru, 80 percent.

WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The head of a broad coalition of Japanese, German and South Korean automakers warned on Friday that renewed punitive Chinese tariffs on U.S. autos would hurt U.S. vehicle exports to China and put U.S. jobs at risk.“The tit-for-tat tariffs, absent any meaningful negotiations, are damaging to the American auto industry,�� John Bozzella, who chairs the ad-hoc group “Here for America,�� said in a statement.“When these tariffs were initially imposed by China in 2017, American exports of finished vehicles dropped by 50 percent. We can’t let that happen to American workers again,�� added Bozzella, who also is chief executive of the Association of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, BMW, Volkswagen, Hyundai Motor and other foreign-owned brands building vehicles in the United States.

SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N and South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor 005380.KS have teamed up to develop electric air taxis, joining the global race to make small self-flying cars to ease urban congestion.Global players like Germany's Daimler DAIGn.DE, China's Geely Automobile 0175.HK and Japan's Toyota 7203.T have all unveiled investments in startups that aim to deploy electric flying cars capable of vertical takeoff and landing. But there are big technological and regulatory hurdles to the plans. Uber and Hyundai, for instance, gave widely different timelines for commercialization, underlining these challenges.“We’ve been making steady progress toward a goal of launching Uber Air by 2023,�� Eric Allison, head of Uber Elevate, said at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.Euisun Chung, Executive Vice Chairman of Hyundai, expects commercialization of urban air mobility service in 2028, saying it takes time for laws and systems to be in place.Hyundai is the first carmaker to join Uber's air taxi project, which also counts Boeing BA.N subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences among its partner firms. Hyundai will produce and deploy the vehicles while Uber will provide aerial ride-share services.Uber, which has partnered with eight companies on its air taxi project, however, acknowledged it would be “unrealistic�� to expect all its partners to go to market at the same time.“Our plans for our limited commercial operations in 2023 will likely involve other partners,�� Sarah Abboud, Communications Manager at Uber, told Reuters.Hyundai will unveil a concept electric aircraft developed with Uber at CES, with the self-flying electric car designed to carry up to four passengers with a pilot and fly on trips of up to 60 miles (100 km).“The overall cost to produce and operate UAM (urban air mobility) vehicles should be really low enough for everyone to enjoy the freedom to fly,�� Shin Jai-won, Head of Urban Air Mobility Division at Hyundai Motor, said.Air taxis come in several shapes and sizes - electric motors replace jet engines, and aircraft have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.The urban flight market will exceed the current number of commercial airplanes flying around the world - about 25,000, Hyundai’s Shin, a former NASA engineer hired by the automaker last year, estimated, without giving any timeframe.Last year, Hyundai pledged to invest 1.8 trillion won ($1.5 billion) in what it called “urban air mobility�� by 2025.Boeing has said it is working with Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE sports car brand, Porsche, to develop a concept electric flying vehicle that can transport people in urban areas.	1.653593386
* Automaker seeks 44 pct rise in SE Asia sales over 3 years* Plans to double capacity to 100,000 vehicles per year (Adds company confirmation, industry context)TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it has bought the site of a former auto plant in the Philippines from Ford Motor Co, beefing up production as it targets a near-50 percent sales boost in fast-growing Southeast Asia markets.Mitsubishi Motors, the second-biggest automaker in the Philippines by sales volume after Toyota Motor Corp, said on Monday it will centre its Philippines production at the plant in Laguna from January 2015. The plant will have an annual capacity of about 50,000 vehicles, gradually rising to around 100,000 vehicles.As part of the strategy, the auto maker will close and sell its ageing existing Philippines plant in Rizal, spokeswoman Tomoko Kawabe said. Mitsubishi Motors declined to say how much it paid to buy the Laguna plant, where Ford made sports utility vehicles until December 2012.The move by Mitsubishi Motors, maker of Triton pickup trucks and Outlander SUVs, adds to growing competition among global car makers in the populous Southeast Asia region, dominated by Toyota and other Japanese car makers.“We are planning to prepare for future growth in the Philippines, whose auto market is likely to continue grow sustainably,�� the company said in a statement.For second-tier car makers like Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor Corp, Southeast Asia offers a major opportunity as they seek to compensate for shrinking sales in their ageing domestic market. The region now accounts for a quarter of Mitsubishi Motors�� global vehicle sales.Mitsubishi Motors has a plan to expand regional sales by 44 percent over three years to end-March 2017. In the Philippines it currently makes vehicles including the Lancer EX sedan and the Adventure SUV.Non-Japanese car makers are also seeking to build up their regional presence. Last year, Volkswagen AG set up distribution channels in Philippines, while General Motors has been stepping up its efforts to sell cars in the region including Indonesia.Shares in Mitsubishi Motors rose 1.9 percent in morning trade to 1,077 yen, outperforming the Nikkei benchmark’s 0.4 percent gain.

TOYOTA CITY, Japan, March 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it will give its Japan-based workers their biggest pay raise in 21 years in the year starting in April, heeding a government call to bolster the economy by sharing its surging profit with workers.Toyota will raise its monthly base pay for workers by 2,700 yen ($26.17) on average, or about 0.8 percent of total monthly pay, marking the first increase in base wages in six years but falling short of its union’s demand for a 4,000 yen increase.Many of Japan’s leading industries announced the results of annual wage negotiations on Wednesday, amid pressure from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for generous raises that could boost household spending and help to pull the world’s third-biggest economy out of two decades of deflation.“There is a certain role that (Toyota’s) labour and management are expected to fulfil in order for the Japanese economy to step out of deflation and attain a virtuous cycle,�� Toyota Senior Managing Officer Naoki Miyazaki told reporters at the auto maker’s central Japan headquarters.“While we have that in mind each year during negotiations, this year that was a little bit more important than usual.”Toyota, the world’s best-selling car maker, expects record profit for the year to March 31, helped by a weakening yen that has boosted the profitability of its export business.Including seniority pay of 7,300 yen, Toyota is giving workers their biggest monthly raise since 1993. Adding in the average annual bonus payment of 2.44 million yen brings the total rise in compensation for the year to about 7.6 percent from a year ago.Offers varied within the auto industry, however.Nissan Motor Co, Japan’s No.2 carmaker by global sales volume, said it will increase its monthly base pay by 3,500 yen and offer bonuses equivalent to 5.6 months of wages, fully meeting its union’s requests.But Daihatsu Motor Co, a Toyota group company that specialises in small cars, said it would offer a more modest base pay rise of only 800 yen, citing increased competition in Japan and a slowdown in Indonesia.Yasunobu Aihara, the president of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers�� Unions, said he saw the pay rises as a significant step in lifting the economy from deflation.“We hope that this will spread widely across the automotive industry, including small and mid-sized companies and irregular workers,�� he told reporters.Japanese electronics companies including Hitachi Ltd , the largest manufacturing employer in Japan with more than 200,000 workers, and Panasonic Corp both said they would boost their monthly base wage by 2,000 yen, half of what their unions requested.	-2.622266582

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of lawsuits against Takata Corp and several car manufacturers over faulty air bags that prompted a wave of recalls will be heard in a Florida federal court, a judicial panel has ruled.U.S. District Judge Frederico Moreno in the Southern District of Florida will preside over the cases, according to a ruling Thursday from the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The panel considers requests to consolidate related lawsuits in U.S. federal courts.More than 70 proposed class actions have been filed in the past few months by customers who say Takata air bags are defective and can violently explode and spray metal debris, putting passengers at risk of injury or death.Some of the lawsuits name as defendants several automakers, including Honda Motor Co, BMW, Ford Motor Co , Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Subaru Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp.The lawsuits say Takata and the automakers knew about the air bag problems for years, but until recently, failed to recall the cars or warn customers and safety regulators.Plaintiffs are seeking economic damages, such as lost resale value. There are also at least 10 state and federal personal-injury lawsuits involving the air bags.Takata’s air bag inflators have been found to explode too forcefully, and the problem has prompted automakers to recall nearly 25 million vehicles worldwide since 2008. The air bags have also been linked to six deaths, all in Honda cars.Plaintiffs�� lawyers, Takata and the automakers had all agreed that the cases should be consolidated to coordinate pre-trial proceedings but disagreed on the venue.Many of the plaintiffs supported Florida, while Takata and six automakers had asked to move the cases to Pittsburgh, which they said was more centrally located.Honda said in a statement that it respected the panel’s decision and looked forward to proceedings before the Miami court.A lead plaintiff’s lawyer who moved to transfer the cases to Florida and officials from BMW were not immediately available for comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T refuses to be tempted away from its low-risk growth strategy, even as the world's bestselling carmaker is likely to show that it met its mid-term profit goals in the year ended March, aided by the weaker yen.Toyota is expected to post on Wednesday an annual operating profit of 1.26 trillion yen ($12.69 billion) according to Thomson Reuters StarMine’s SmartEstimates, with an operating margin of about 5.6 percent. SmartEstimates place emphasis on timely forecasts by top-rated analysts.That would mean the company has achieved the target President Akio Toyoda set two years ago: to make 1 trillion yen in annual operating profit, and do so with a 5 percent margin. Its Japanese manufacturing arm is also likely to post a profit for the first time in five years.For Toyoda, mindful of lessons learned from huge losses run up in 2008 after a period of boom and rapid expansion, high profits are no reason to launch into a building program - even as some rivals do exactly that.“I became painfully aware that the most important thing is to keep growing at a sustainable pace. Expanding vehicle volume does not equate with growth, because fixed costs also increase,�� the 57-year-old grandson of the founder of Toyota’s automotive business said in March. “I want this year to think about what competitiveness really means for Toyota.”Since Toyoda took helm in 2009, when profit margins were thin, the automaker has focused on cutting costs and improving profitability.Evidence of Toyoda's caution is his fresh policy to build no new factories for the next three years, a sharp contrast with Honda Motor Co 7267.T which is rapidly adding to its production power around the world.Many analysts say Toyota will remain competitive.“Toyota will have enough capacity. It could see some opportunity losses such as in volume and market share, but its priority is profitability,�� said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at Advanced Research.Despite building no new plants Toyota, which currently has an annual production capacity of around 9 million vehicles, will still be able to make more cars.It will stick with pre-existing plans to build new factories such as in Thailand and Indonesia and will also add capacity at plants already running, for example at its Kentucky plant in the United States.Toyota expects another year of record group sales in 2013, reaching 9.91 million vehicles. It could become the first carmaker in history to sell more than 10 million vehicles a year.For the financial year to end-March 2014, analysts estimate 2 trillion yen in operating profit, nearing its record from five years ago, helped by the yen that has weakened by around 15 percent against the dollar since January. Toyota exports about 60 percent of its Japan-made vehicles.After recovering from a damaging safety recall in 2010 and a huge earthquake in 2011 in Japan that disrupted supply chains, Toyota booked record group-wide sales of 9.7 million vehicles in 2012, beating General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.On Wednesday, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T, which makes Subaru cars, is likely to book record annual operating profit of 120 billion yen for the year ended in March, more than double last year's figure. The company is set to announce a plan to expand capacity in the United States, its biggest market.($1 = 99.3100 Japanese yen)	-2.205513784

(Adds details, quotes, background)ADAPAZARI, Turkey, July 9 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Turkish business saw first-half exports slump by 30 percent after a weaker rouble hit Russia’s car market, but hopes to pare losses with sales domestically and to Europe, the unit’s chief executive said.The Adapazari, Turkey-based plant makes Corollas and Versos and has capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles, about 1.5 percent of Toyota’s global production of about 10 million cars and trucks.The Turkish business expects to finish the year with a 9 percent decline in sales, or about 120,000 vehicles, Orhan Ozer told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday.He did not give a figure for sales in the first half, but said output fell 14 percent.“We saw a serious fall in exports this year due to the events in Russia and the devaluation (of the rouble),�� Ozer said. “Russia was our top market for the Corolla, we were planning to sell a quarter of our Corollas to Russia, but we’re not even selling 10 percent.”Car sales in Russia have plunged since 2014 as the economy weakened due to lower oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. In 2015, new car sales are seen at 1.55 million, down 36 percent.“We will compensate with (sales in) Turkey, Poland, Britain and Israel, bringing it to a level of 120,000, compared with exports of 131,000 last year,�� Ozer said. So far, Israel has been the main buyer, followed by Russia, Egypt, France and Spain.The plant normally exports about 90 percent of the vehicles it makes, but so far this year it has exported 73 percent.Despite the drop, Toyota is working to boost exports and capacity at the Adapazari plant under a 2014 investment plan of $500 million, Ozer said. The Japanese carmaker has previously said it wants to raise capacity by two thirds to 250,000.Toyota would be interested in eventually selling vehicles to neighbouring Iran, Ozer added. Tehran is in talks with the United States and other Western powers on curbing its nuclear programme to end sanctions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has established a new venture to develop electric vehicle technology with partner Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, seeking to catch up with rivals in an increasingly frenetic race to produce more battery-powered cars.Policymakers in key markets like China are pushing a shift to electric cars over the next two to three decades, while relatively new rival Tesla Inc TSLA.O is gaining momentum, pressuring traditional automakers to crank up plans for fully electric vehicles (EVs).At the same time, declining battery costs are enabling more power to be packed into cars, making an electric car future easier to imagine.Toyota said in a statement the new company will develop technology for a range of electric cars, including minivehicles, passenger cars, SUVs and light trucks.Toyota will take a 90 percent stake in the joint venture, called EV Common Architecture Spirit Co Ltd, while Mazda and Denso Corp 6902.T, Toyota's biggest supplier, will each take 5 percent.The plans build on a partnership announced in August when Japan’s biggest automaker agreed to take a 5 percent stake in Mazda and two said they would jointly develop affordable electric vehicle technologies.Although Toyota is providing most of the financial firepower and existing EV know-how, Mazda’s engineers have gained the admiration of the industry with break-through technologies such as its compression ignition engine announced last month.Shares in Mazda surged to end the day 3 percent higher, while those in Denso rose 1.8 percent. Toyota shares were flat.Both automakers are somewhat behind rivals, with neither having a fully electric passenger car on the market yet.After years of focusing on bringing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to the market, Toyota last year set up a division to develop electric cars which is led by President Akio Toyoda, and said it plans to introduce EVs in China in the coming years.That division would continue as a separate entity from the new joint venture, a Toyota spokeswoman said, while adding that the two teams would co-operate on technology development.Mazda has an R&amp;D budget a fraction of Toyota’s, which has made it difficult to develop electric cars on its own. Even so, it has said it plans to launch EVs in 2020.By comparison, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T has the world's top selling electric car, the Leaf, and it and partner Renault SA RENA.PA expect electric models to account for 30 percent of their vehicle sales by 2022.Competition from unexpected quarters is also heating up. Just this week, James Dyson, the billionaire British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, said his company was working on developing an electric car to be launched by 2020.	4.005016722
(Reuters) - T. Boone Pickens, a celebrated corporate raider and energy industry magnate who built an empire out of an initial $2,500 investment, died on Wednesday at age 91.The Oklahoma-born tycoon, known for his folksy speech and ruthless business acumen, died surrounded by his family and friends, said longtime spokesman Jay Rosser.“He was coming into the office every day until Monday,�� said Rosser. “He stayed active running his own portfolio.”Pickens closed his BP Capital energy hedge fund after suffering a stroke in late 2016 and due to the effects of a fall in mid-2017 that required hospitalization.“Trading oil is not as intriguing to me as it once was,�� Pickens wrote more than 18 months ago on his boonepickens.com website to announce the closure of the fund. “It’s no secret the past year has not been good to me, from a health perspective or a financial one.”Pickens was remembered for his contributions to advances in medical research, athletic and educational initiatives, and for advocating for increased domestic use of abundant natural gas.“He generously shared his success with institutions and communities across Texas and Oklahoma,�� said former President George W. Bush.Pickens�� commitment to energy projects “will have a lasting impact on the state of Texas, and the United States of America,�� added Texas Governor Greg Abbott.In late 2017, Pickens had put his 65,000-acre (26,000-hectare) Mesa Vista Ranch in the Texas Panhandle up for sale at a price of $250 million. In addition to a castle-like main building, the ranch had its own airfield, art gallery, pub, chapel and two-story dog kennel.Pickens ran energy firms, hedge funds and wind farms, offering forecasts on oil prices and in 2008, when his fortune was estimated at $3 billion by Forbes magazine, announced the Pickens Plan for an energy independent United States. He promoted the plan in television ads and interviews and testified about it before Congress, bemoaning reliance on foreign oil and pushing the potential of wind energy.Pickens had aspirations of creating the world’s biggest wind farm in the Panhandle with the capability of powering 1.3 millions homes at a cost of $10 billion. By 2010, however, he had given up on a big-scale wind farm due to difficulties with financing and a lack of transmission lines.Pickens had gained notoriety in the 1980s as a consummate dealmaker who launched audacious bids to take over giant oil companies including his former employer Phillips Petroleum Co, as well as Gulf Oil Corp and Unocal Corp with leveraged buyouts.He failed on all the big takeover bids but made millions of dollars in the process. With Gulf Oil, his bid drove the nation’s fifth largest oil company into a record $13.2 billion merger with Chevron Corp and his bold moves landed him on the covers of magazines such as Forbes and Time.“There is nothing better than being the underdog,�� he wrote in his 2008 book “The First Billion is the Hardest.”�The more people count me out, the more I count myself in.”Dubbed the “oracle of oil�� in media outlets, Pickens portrayed himself as a tireless campaigner for shareholder rights and repeatedly argued that America’s managers had become more concerned with the four P’s - pay, perks, power and prestige - than with making money for the company’s real owners.Thomas Boone Pickens Jr. was born on May 22, 1928, in Holdenville, Oklahoma, and in the late 1930s moved with his family to Texas.Graduating with a geology degree from what later would become Oklahoma State University, Pickens worked for Phillips Petroleum for about three years before borrowing $2,500 and going out on his own. He and two investors formed an oil and gas firm called Petroleum Exploration Inc.The firm would later became Mesa Petroleum, which at one time, was one of the world’s largest independent oil companies, with assets of more than $2 billion in 1980, according to the Texas State Historical Association.In 1996, Pickens, announced his retirement from Mesa. The move came after a long battle with dissident shareholders, who were angry at the company’s mounting debts. Critics say he held bitter grudges against those he thought had crossed him.In the late 1980s, Pickens shook up corporate Japan when he tried to take over Koito Manufacturing Co Ltd, a Tokyo-based automotive parts maker. He became the biggest single shareowner in the firm with a holding of 20.2%, about 1% more than Toyota Motor Corp.After butting heads with corporate management and investors for some two years over the raid, a rare occurrence in Japan, he sold back his holdings.Pickens also made waves politically, helping finance accusations by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth against Democratic Senator John Kerry in his 2004 presidential election campaign, which questioned aspects of the politician’s military service in the Vietnam War.Pickens contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Oklahoma State University and set up a foundation that bears his name, which made major donations to medical institutions in Texas. In 2005 the school renamed its football stadium for him.He was known for his nuggets of homespun business wisdom known as Boone-isms, such as, “A fool with a plan can beat a genius with no plan.”Pickens is survived by his five children, 11 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.	-0.530230503
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T shares fell as much as 11.6% on Wednesday, with its market capitalization dipping below the value of its domestic telco, as uncertainty grows over its management of a portfolio of unproven startups.The tech conglomerate's market cap fell to a low of 6.84 trillion yen ($64 billion), below SoftBank Corp's 9434.T 7.1 trillion yen, reflecting the depth of investor scepticism over Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's assertions his tech bets are back on track and as the coronavirus outbreak roils markets. Concern was exacerbated with sources telling Reuters that SoftBank is considering pulling out of a $3 billion bid to buy additional shares in its biggest soured bet, office-sharing firm WeWork, in what would be a major U-turn after it was forced to bail out the startup.Last week, SoftBank announced a $4.8 billion share buyback amid fragile markets, a move S&amp;P Global Ratings said “raises questions over its commitment to financial management�� and prompted a revision in its outlook for the company to negative.“We believe SoftBank’s aggressiveness in pursuing growth and managing its finances makes its financial standing weak,�� S&amp;P said.Unlike peers such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co 9983.T, SoftBank's Son has spent much of his cash pile investing in overseas startups, many of which analysts believe are exposed to a looming slowdown. “We think no other company in Japan is as indebted and as exposed to the economic downturn as SoftBank,�� Amir Anvarzadeh, market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors, wrote in a note.SoftBank last month said it would pledge shares in its domestic telco as collateral to raise up to $4.5 billion, reflecting its falling back on established portfolio businesses for cash as its $100 billion Vision Fund struggles to raise capital for a successor fund.“For the next few months, cash is going to be the single most important factor as only cash will allow affected businesses to survive the very sharp (but temporary) decline in their revenues,�� tech analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note.	7.357629017

BANGKOK, July 28 (Reuters) - Thailand’s biggest automaker slashed on Tuesday its forecast for total domestic car sales by all makers this year by 9 percent because of the poor performance of Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy.Toyota Motor Corp’s Thai unit forecast the country’s total auto sales for 2015 would fall to 800,000 cars, a sharp change from its January forecast for sales to rise by 4.3 percent.That would mark the third consecutive year of sales declines for the domestic market of the region’s auto manufacturing hub.“The Thai economy has yet to fully recover, and with an unstable global economic outlook depressing consumer spending, this will also have an impact in auto sales this year,�� Kyoichi Tanada, president of the Toyota Thai unit, told a news briefing.“It will be the most challenging year for the car market for all of us.”The number of total vehicles sold in the first half was 369,109, a 16.3 percent drop from last year, he said.In 2014, overall domestic auto sales tumbled 33.7 percent to 881,832, hit by political unrest that led to an army coup in May that year. In 2013, sales fell after a government subsidy scheme for first-time car buyers ended.Toyota, which has about a third of the Thai market, cut its own sales target to 280,000 vehicles in 2015 from 330,000 projected earlier.In 2014, the company sold 327,027 vehicles in Thailand, down 27 percent from a year earlier.Auto exports are also falling, part of a wider malaise in the export industry upon which Thailand is dependent.Earlier on Tuesday, the Industry Ministry said annual factory output in June fell by 8 percent, the biggest drop since March 2014. That was partly due to a fall of 26 percent on the year in car exports in June.“Exports markets are not growing, capacity utilisation is not high in Thailand,�� said Nattapol Rangsitpot, deputy director-general of the ministry’s Office of Industrial Economics, told Reuters.Thailand’s finance ministry on Tuesday cut its economic growth forecast to 3.0 percent from 3.7 percent this year due to poor performance from the export sector.

* To be priced from 1.99 mln yen ($26,100) in Japan* Sales in Japan to start April 6* To be sold in U.S. as FR-S under Scion brand* Joint developer Fuji Heavy to sell the car as Subaru BRZCHIBA, Japan, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it aims to sell 1,000 of its ��86�� sports car model per month in Japan, hoping the vehicle will become a symbol of its rebirth as a maker of fun cars after years of being known for reliability and fuel efficiency.Sales will begin on April 6 in Japan. Toyota will also offer the car in the United States under its youth-oriented Scion brand as the FR-S.The lightweight 86 was jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru-maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, known for its expertise in horizontally opposed engines.The much-awaited rear-wheel-drive car -- the brand’s first sports car since 2007 -- will cost 1.99 million yen ($26,100) for the lowest grade, 6-speed manual version while the top-of-the-line model will be priced at 3.05 million yen.Subaru will launch the car as the BRZ under its own brand on Friday, and build the car for both companies at its Gunma factory, north of Tokyo.The 86 is a tribute to the popular AE86 version of Toyota’s Corolla Levin/Sprinter Trueno, which enjoyed a large fan base in the 1980s as a “drift car�� and for its affordability.	6.23774029
Chase Elliott made a major move in Sunday’s Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway.No, Elliott didn’t win the race, but his fourth-place finish was a career best in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series in five starts on road courses.While other contending drivers -- including top-three finishers Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick and Clint Bowyer -- came to pit road before the ends of the first two stages to set up superior track position, Elliott stayed out through the green/checkered flags to collect stage points, finish fourth in Stage 1 and second in Stage 2.In the final stage, however, he overcame the disadvantaged track position to run fourth behind the three strongest cars in the race. And by scoring 49 points on Sunday, seven more than any other driver and nine more than race winner Truex, Elliott solidified his 13th-place position in the series standings.More than anything, Elliott has begun to enjoy road-course racing.“It was a lot more fun, this trip out here, than it was the last two times,�� said Elliott, who finished 21st and eighth, respectively, in his first two Sonoma races. “I made a lot of gains, personally, I think, for me at this track. It’s been one of my worst. To come here and have pace on Friday and qualify good on Saturday, and to have pace today, it was just a lot more fun.“I appreciate everyone on my NAPA team working hard this weekend. We had a fast Chevrolet all three days. And that’s nice to show up and get rhythm. We kind of had to pick our battles today. We elected to get some stage points and that set us back a little for that last stage, but I don’t think we had the pace that the leaders had. So it was a good finish for me, and we’re looking forward to the next road race.”AJ Allmendinger had just won the first stage of Sunday’s Toyota/Save Mart 350 when his race -- and his engine -- fell apart.Allmendinger started fifth and quickly worked his way into second place during the first stage, only to surrender the runner-up spot to Kevin Harvick on Lap 15 of the 25-lap stage. But when Martin Truex Jr. and Harvick pitted early on Lap 22, Allmendinger inherited the top spot and held it through the green/checkered flag, collecting the first stage win of his career.Allmendinger brought the No. 47 JTG Daugherty Chevrolet to pit road during the caution between stages and restart 17th on Lap 30. Four circuits later, however, his race came to an end when Allmendinger missed a shift and blew the engine in his Chevy, ruining one of his best chances to win a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race.“I just missed a shift,�� the disconsolate driver said afterward. “I haven’t missed a shift in probably 10 years on a road course. The best gear boxes I have had since I’ve ever been here, and, I don’t know -- I just missed a shift.“Just trying to be patient back there and set up each move. The car was pretty good. I don’t know if it was race-winning... we needed to work on the long run, but, believe me, when it happened I was in a lot of disbelief and shock. I wasn’t ready for it and let everybody down on this race team.”Clint Bowyer engineered a spectacular drive in Sunday’s Toyota/Save Mart 350, starting 19th and climbing to third at the finish.But the winner of two Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races this season wanted more. Bowyer had tasted victory at Sonoma Raceway in 2012, and he had a craving to quaff the California wine that goes to the winner once again.Only two problems: 1) Race winner Martin Truex Jr.’s pit strategy, which afforded a comfortable winning margin with a single stop to Bowyer’s two in the final stage, and 2) Bowyer’s teammate Kevin Harvick, who wasn’t willing to surrender the second spot.“I’m happy to be in this (Stewart-Haas Racing) equipment and have this opportunity, but I’m also frustrated, because we were one of the three that were the class of the field and had a legitimate shot at racing for a win,�� Bowyer said. “They (Truex’s team) just took a little different strategy than we did, and that’s what it took. You had to separate yourself some way.“It was a lot of fun out there. I had my struggles just like they did. It seemed like the 4 (Harvick) had a little better turn than I did, and the 78 (Truex) was better. On long runs I was coming to him, especially that real long run we had. Then we started pitting, and I didn’t know what to expect. All in all, it was a solid day and I’m proud of the guys for going out there and getting the job done. We just came up a little short.��--By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service. Special to Field Level Media.	2.831142568
TOKYO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it has slashed the cost of the fuel cell system in its next hydrogen-powered car by almost $1 million, putting it on course to launch a mid-sized sedan in 2015 with a price ticket below $100,000.The world’s best-selling auto manufacturer and maker of the Prius gas-electric hybrid car says the fuel cell system will cost about 5 million yen ($51,000) compared with prototype costs of over $1 million.The company is betting on fuel cell cars, which convert hydrogen to electricity, emit only water vapour and have a similar range to conventional petrol-driven cars, as the next-generation alternative fuel vehicle.“We aim to sell tens of thousands of fuel cell vehicles a year by sometime in the 2020s,�� Managing Officer Satoshi Ogiso told reporters earlier this week in Tokyo where Toyota showed off its advanced technologies.Toyota engineer Hitoshi Nomasa said the company had cut its use of platinum, which sells on world markets around $1,380 an ounce (28 grams), from around 100 grams in the fuel cell of its current hydrogen-powered SUV model to around 30 grams.The figure would come down more with improvements in platinum coating technology, Nomasa told Reuters.Diesel catalytic converters currently use some 20 grams of platinum, Nomasa said, adding: “If we can bring it down to around there, then that would be about the same level of platinum being used in cars that are widely used.”Toyota will also use less carbon-fiber in the high-pressure hydrogen tanks and will use more cheaper, mass-produced components to cut costs, the company has said.Unlike electric cars, whose range is often limited to 100-200 km and which need hours to recharge, hydrogen vehicles can refuel within minutes and travel distances similar to those of autos with conventional combustion engines.But for fuel cell vehicles to take off, hydrogen refuelling infrastructure needs to be in place and the car price must drop.Toyota currently leases around 100 fuel cell SUVs to governments and local authorities in Japan and the United States, though they are not available to the general public.The new fuel cell sedan will be sold in certain areas in Japan, the United States and Europe, Toyota said. It is set to unveil a concept model of the sedan at the Tokyo Motor Show in November.Toyota is also working on a fuel cell vehicle system with Germany’s BMW AG and has said it wants to introduce a new fuel cell vehicle around 2020 using the jointly developed technology.	-3.782757311
GRAPHIC: Philippine, ASEAN sales: link.reuters.com/pyz55wData from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc (CAMPI) points to sales of 310,000 vehicles this year, up nearly a third from last year - and roughly double the tally in 2012. The growth could be sustained in the coming years partly due to the government’s unveiling of a long-awaited $600 million incentive scheme earlier this year.While the Philippines is only the region’s fourth-biggest market, sales are falling in the top three - Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. The trend is fueling industry hopes in Manila that automakers like Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, dominant in the Philippines, may boost investment in local production facilities to draw on a widening growth pool.“Auto sales continue to be strong because of the steady growth of buying capacity of customers,�� CAMPI President Rommel Gutierrez told Reuters in a text message. “Financing companies are also offering attractive financing packages which make purchasing vehicles easier.”Surging auto sales have been accompanied by a jump in total auto loans, up a record 26 percent in the first quarter to 244.6 billion pesos ($5.24 billion), according to central bank data. As the Philippine middle class grows, and avails itself of the car purchase perks from Manila, market leader Toyota has strong hopes for entry-level vehicles like its Wigo hatchback and Vios compact sedan.	1.905311778
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation into whether General Motors Co GM.N reacted fast enough in its recall of more than 1.6 million cars over an ignition-switch defect linked to 13 deaths in crashes.The issue could prove costly to GM as the automaker faces a potential fine from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the cost of replacing the ignition switches in question and the possibility of costly lawsuits.“The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation into the timeliness of General Motors�� recall of faulty ignition switches to determine whether GM properly followed the legal processes and requirements for reporting recalls,�� the safety agency said in a statement released on Wednesday.GM, which went through a bankruptcy restructuring in 2009, could face a maximum fine of $35 million if it failed to notify NHTSA within five days of a recall after learning of a vehicle safety defect.The company did not say how much the recall would cost, but LMC Automotive analyst Jeff Schuster said the biggest cost to the automaker could result from the flurry of lawsuits likely to be triggered by the defect and the company’s actions.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T last year paid more than $1 billion to resolve economic-loss claims related to the recall of millions of vehicles for unintended acceleration. The Japanese automaker is still trying to settle personal-injury lawsuits.GM’s recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off.GM previously said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the “run�� position, turning off the engine and most of the car’s electrical components.NHTSA urged owners to follow GM’s recommendation to “use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring�� when operating the vehicle and seek the repair as soon as replacement parts become available. GM said the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.NHTSA said it will monitor the recall and take additional action as needed. Up to now, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Ford Motor Co F.N have paid the largest fines of more than $17 million to NHTSA for delaying recalls.On Tuesday GM more than doubled its recall related to the issue, saying it was “deeply sorry�� and that the company was reviewing its recall process, acknowledging it was not as “robust as it should have been.GM said then that it was aware of 31 reported incidents, including 13 front-seat fatalities, involving frontal crashes in which the condition may have caused or contributed to the front airbags not deploying.On Thursday, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra declined to address the issue at an event in Boston. But the company said in a statement: “We deeply regret the events that led to the recall and this investigation. As our detailed chronology indicates, we intend to fully cooperate with NHTSA and we welcome the opportunity to help the agency have a full understanding of the facts.”GM previously said all the crashes occurred off-road and at high speeds, where the probability of serious or fatal injuries was high regardless of airbag deployment. Failure to wear seat belts and alcohol use also were factors in some cases, the company said.Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington advocacy group that pushed for the wider recall, said the whole recall system is broken. “GM doesn’t get a get-out-of-jail-free card just because NHTSA did a sloppy job,�� he said.In light of GM’s bigger recall, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, on Wednesday called on NHTSA to require automakers to provide detailed information to the agency when they become aware of accidents involving deaths. He said GM was aware of fatal accidents in Maryland and Wisconsin in 2005 and 2006 involving safety issues and notified dealers, but did not recall the vehicles involved.“The current early warning reporting system is too little, too late,�� he said in a statement. “We need to overhaul the early warning reporting system so that NHTSA is not looking at auto defects through a rear-view mirror.”David Strickland, who was head of NHTSA from January 2010 until December 2013 and oversaw NHTSA’s investigation of Toyota, said it was too soon to blame NHSTA for failing to act sooner.Strickland, now a partner at Venable LLP, a law firm that represents the auto industry, said the agency’s probe will focus more on the timeliness of GM’s response to the problem than on the number of deaths or injuries related to the ignition issue.“They’ll try to figure out when the manufacturer knew it had a defect that posed a risk to safety,�� he said.Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Arthur Henry said recalls typically do not hurt automakers�� brand image. GM’s recall and the media fervor around it is reminiscent of what Toyota went through in 2009 and 2010, he said, when it recalled more than 19 million vehicles globally related to unintended acceleration.“Toyota has shown that a brand can recover from an incident like this and what may help GM is the fact that the majority of the models recalled are discontinued,�� he said. “This may dissolve any negative projection toward its new products.”Earlier this month, GM said it was recalling 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 compact cars from model years 2005 through 2007. On Tuesday, it added 842,103 Saturn Ion compact cars from 2003 through 2007 model years, Chevy HHR mid-sized vehicles from 2006 and 2007, and the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007.A spokesman for GM’s Europe unit, Opel, said the 2007 Opel GT Roadster, which was based on the same platform as the Solstice and Sky, also is affected, adding around 2,300 more vehicles to the recall.GM no longer makes any of the affected cars.It previously said it is working with suppliers to increase production of replacement parts. GM said the ignition switch torque performance may not meet company specifications. The involved parts were made in Mexico, according to documents previously filed with NHTSA.Of the cars recalled, 1,367,146 vehicles are in the United States, 235,855 are in Canada, 15,073 are in Mexico and 2,591 were exported outside North America, according to GM.GM said in documents filed with NHTSA that it first learned of the issue in 2004, around the time of the 2005 Cobalt launch with a report of at least one incident where a Cobalt lost engine power because the key moved out of the “run�� position.The company later issued a bulletin alerting dealers to advise owners of the issue.In March 2007, NHTSA officials alerted GM to a fatal Cobalt crash from July 2005 in which the front airbags did not deploy, according to the NHTSA documents. While GM’s legal department had opened a file on that crash in September 2005, GM employees meeting with NHTSA in 2007 were unaware of the crash.In late July 2011, a meeting of GM legal staff and engineers led to the an investigation of crashes in which airbags did not deploy, according to the NHTSA documents.	-2.081526453

DETROIT (Reuters) - Renesas Electronics Corp said on Tuesday it will provide semiconductors for self-driving cars that Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp plans to bring to market in 2020.Automakers are racing to be the first to market with commercially viable self-driving vehicles.Renesas said it will provide a chip to Toyota - the R-Car system-on-chip - that will serve as an “electronic brain�� or as advanced driver-assistance systems. The company will provide a separate chip for automotive control.The first chip will provide “highly accurate intelligence on the vehicle’s position within its environment�� and will also make “real-time decisions on vehicle control and active safety maneuvers based on sensor data,�� Renesas said.The second chip, called RH850, will “control driving, steering, and braking functions based on the judgments�� made by the R-Car system-on-chip.Fully self-driving vehicles are expected to hit the market in a limited form by around 2020. U.S. automakers General Motors Co and rival Ford Motor Co have both publicly stated that they aim to have fully self-driving cars on sale by 2021.Renesas�� chips will be used with an engine control unit that will be provided by Denso Corp, Toyota’s largest supplier.“We are partnering with Denso and Renesas, who bring superior technology and expertise to this project, with the aim to accelerate the development of autonomous-driving vehicles and encourage early adoption,�� Ken Koibuchi, Executive General Manager at Toyota Motor Corporation, said in a statement.	-0.05625652978

* Sales likely to contract for fourth month in July* Stocks crash, slow economy drag on consumer sentiment* Carmakers weigh further discounts, cost-cuttingBEIJING, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Automakers in China may be forced to come up with more drastic mitigation measures when July sales results released from this week likely reveal a fourth month of contraction after a stock market crash sapped consumer sentiment.Many Chinese who put money in the mainland bull market in the first half of 2015 had to delay big-ticket purchases like cars, analysts said. But a crash from mid-June erased as much as $4 trillion in share value in under a month. What is left of their money is now locked in stocks as many try to avoid losses.Sales in the world’s biggest auto market have been hit by declining sentiment as the economy grows at its slowest in 25 years, prompting cost-cutting and discounts. But the crash likely left July sales falling more than June’s 2.3 percent, analysts said.“Car manufacturers are biting their nails as they wait to see July sales and the full impact the stock market crash really had,�� said a Shanghai-based executive at a major U.S. carmaker.China’s auto manufacturing body said it more than halved its 2015 sales forecast because of the crash’s impact on sentiment, while consultancy Automotive Foresight last week demonstrated a correlation between money locked in stocks and falling sales.Audi AG sales chief Christian Klingler, in a conference call on Thursday, said China will turn “into a bumpy road in the next few months��.The government took several measures to stabilise share prices, but they continue to fluctuate wildly with last week seeing the steepest single-day fall since 2007.Analysts expect car sales will continue to be weak at least until stocks stabilise as fear of another tumble cloud consumers�� future finances in uncertainty.Automakers, many of whom have already flagged slowing sales, start reporting China figures on Monday, beginning with Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers releases overall market data next week.Toyota and compatriots like Honda Motor Co Ltd look likely to lead the pack due to strong sales of new sports utility vehicles (SUVs) as many middle-class Chinese trade up from sedans.Automakers without top-selling SUVs, such as Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co, have fared less well and may need to further cut costs and prices, analysts said. On Wednesday, Peugeot SA said it would review costs.Mazda Motor Corp, one of this year’s front-runners, said it is concerned over-capacity may force automakers to offer more buying incentives and even sell at a loss.“The rate of growth is stalling... On top of that is the stock market fall. Consumers are mentally chilled,�� said Masahiro Moro, Mazda’s managing executive officer and head of global marketing. “Up to now it’s been growth and growth.”An executive at Audi said automakers need to expand their financing, insurance and used car businesses.��(Dealers) reflect that the glory days are over of selling cars above list price,�� the executive said. “It’s now a competitive market like Western Europe.��	-11.68343595

WARSAW, Dec 5 (Reuters) - New car registrations in Poland rose by 19.4 percent year-on-year in November, posting their 20th consecutive month of annual growth and the strongest November for 16 years, research institute Samar said on Monday.Passenger car and small truck registrations, a proxy for sales, stood at 42,165, up 14.3 percent from October.Year-to-date, registrations were up by 17 percent from the corresponding period last year.“As in the previous months, higher sales in November were primarily due to corporate (buying) activity,�� Samar said in a statement, adding that these purchases accounted for 68 percent of all purchases in November.The larger share of corporate car purchases meant a higher proportion of new cars sold were from the higher-priced, or premium, segment of the market, Samar said.“Compared to the corresponding month last year, there were 30 percent more premium cars registered (in November),�� Samar said.The top-selling car makers in Poland are Volkswagen and its Czech subsidiary Skoda, Toyota , General Motors�� Opel and Ford.

DENVER (Reuters) - Oil producer Hess Corp has turned to a manufacturing process developed by automaker Toyota Motor Corp to cut costs and boost production as crude oil prices lag.Deploying a process called Lean manufacturing, and used by only a handful of other oil producers, the move has shaved roughly $400,000 off the cost of each North Dakota well in the past eight months, a savings that comes even as Hess adds more sand and frac stages on each well.It has also sharply cut the time needed to drill a new well.By mirroring Toyota, which pushed its employees relentlessly each day to focus on ways to produce cars cheaply and more efficiently, steps that helped it rival Detroit automakers, Hess hopes to emerge from the oil price slump stronger than peers.The New York-based company believes that by using Lean manufacturing its 1,200 operated Bakken wells can remain profitable with U.S. crude oil prices above $40 per barrel, roughly $9 below current levels.Hess also said it could go so far as to survive with oil around those levels for the next five years.“This stuff really does work when you have a culture that is behind it,�� Hess President Greg Hill said in an interview on the sidelines of the DUG Conference in Denver. “We haven’t even scratched the surface.”Hill, who joined Hess from Shell in 2009, has data to back up his use of Lean manufacturing. Since the first quarter of 2012, the company’s well costs have dropped 47 percent in the Bakken to about $7.1 million. For 2015, Hess hopes to cut that to $6.8 million.In the same timeframe, the time spent to drill a new well has dropped 51 percent.Hess management has been encouraging employees to eliminate waste by focusing daily on what did and did not work and quickly learn from mistakes.Not as concrete or final as other methods, such as layoffs or contract cancellations, the process stresses softer metrics and personal accountability.Contractors, especially, are pushed to improve efficiency and cut costs, a key part of the program like Toyota, which controls much of its manufacturing. Hess relies on Halliburton, Baker Hughes and other contractors to perform the heavy lifting needed to extract oil.As part of finding what methods work best, for instance, Hess saw that using expensive ceramic proppant as part of its fracking process was not cost effective.So, it stopped, Hill said.“We are more optimistic and more excited than we’ve ever been on the Bakken,�� Hill said.	1.55781049
* Toyota execs mull repositioning of 10-year-old brand* One option: reinvention as a premium small car brand* Scion also looks at hybrid, crossover, 4-door sedan* Brand’s 2012 sales were less than half its 2006 peakBy Ben KlaymanDETROIT, April 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp executives are weighing repositioning Scion as a line of premium small cars as they debate the youth brand’s future in the United States.A decade after its launch as a way to lure younger buyers into Toyota showrooms, Scion is still a work in progress as it looks to rebound from low sales during the recession. The brand is a relatively small seller for Toyota, with its five models selling 73,500 vehicles last year. That compares with Toyota’s four-car Prius line, which sold almost 237,000.The Japanese automaker’s top executives concede that Scion is at a crossroads of sorts.“There’s still debate on where we should go from here,�� Jim Lentz, Toyota’s newly appointed chief executive of North America, told Reuters in a recent interview.“One of the alternatives is we’ve always felt that there’s going to be a big segment created of premium small cars in the U.S.,�� he added. Lentz cited the push by the German luxury brands into lower-cost entries such as the Mercedes-Benz CLA that will sell for less than $30,000.As part of the effort to boost sales, Scion at the New York auto show last week showed off a redesigned tC coupe that will go on sale in late May. However, the brand’s future is already being discussed and options include adding a hybrid vehicle, a crossover or even a four-door sedan.“Any of them could happen,�� Lentz said.Scion’s sales total last year was less than half of its 2006 peak, but far improved from 2010’s nadir of about 46,000 vehicles. Officials expect to sell about 80,000 this year and research firm LMC Automotive forecasts the brand to hit 108,000 in 2020, but company officials insist the brand has never been about the numbers.Introduced as concept vehicles at the New York show in 2002, Scion began selling cars the following year with the idea of appealing to Generation Y buyers who perceived Toyota vehicles as too stodgy. The brand’s buyers are 37 years old, on average - the youngest in the industry - compared with age 50 for Toyota, and 75 percent of Scion buyers are new to the Toyota family, company officials said.What Scion - whose name means “heir�� and which refers to the brand’s cars and owners - stands for remains unclear to many analysts and consumers, however. Some industry analysts were confused last year when Scion introduced the FR-S sports coupe at a higher price than the brand’s other four models.“Toyota still hasn’t found its feet with Scion,�� said Art Spinella, president of research firm CNW Research. “They’re still hunting and pecking around, trying to figure out what the heck the darn thing is.”Lincoln Merrihew, auto analyst with Compete, a unit of WPP Plc’s Kantar Media, said Scion is “at a fork in the road.”Is the brand all about sporty coupes like the tC and FR-S that go in and out of fashion relatively quickly? Or is it quirky, yet functional boxy vehicles like the xB wagon, he said. Scion also sells the xD four-door hatchback and iQ urban minicar.Most Scion vehicles range from about $16,000 to $20,000. The FR-S, which starts at $25,000, is a strange fit in the portfolio for many analysts, some of whom insist the car would be a better fit under the Toyota brand.Rapidly expanding Scion does not seem to be in the cards. “If we could add a sixth, we can probably manage that. I don’t see us doing 10,�� Scion Vice President Doug Murtha said at the New York show.As the market changes, however, so might Scion, Lentz said. That discussion is not new.“The Prius C, quite frankly, could have been a Scion product,�� he said. “We kind of debated which channel makes more sense.�� The car was placed with Toyota in the end because younger buyers favor better audio systems or wheels, and it made more sense financially to market all the Prius vehicles together.Toyota’s mistake with Scion was targeting a young demographic instead of creating a brand that appealed across many demographics with a common psychological pull like BMW’s Mini cars, LMC senior analyst Joe Langley said.“Toyota still needs to develop a more clear identity and direction for the brand,�� he said.	8.89898703
TOYOTA CITY, Japan/TOKYO, April 16 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is set to post record growth for the year just ended - with a likely $10 billion surge in operating profit - but the mood at its HQ in Japan’s prosperous automotive heartland is cautious as executives warn of a leaner year ahead.Japan’s most valuable listed company is shifting to a new phase of much slower but more stable growth, senior executives said, as the burst of gains from a weak yen and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus policies fades.That trend, fed also by an increase in Japan’s sales tax and slowdowns in key overseas markets such as Thailand, could see the world’s largest carmaker eventually losing its crown to an ascendant Volkswagen AG.“Last year’s pace was abnormal in the context of sustainable growth,�� said a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We don’t want people to be up on cloud nine just because we hit a record.”Added another: “We need to be cautious.”A slowdown for the country’s biggest manufacturing profit earner will bode poorly for Japan’s economic outlook.Three senior Toyota executives spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, discussing the company’s outlook for the fiscal year from April 1 ahead of the release of official guidance on May 8. They did not give any financial details.Separately, a source close to Toyota said it may project a fall in profit for this fiscal year, a view echoed by some analysts, who note its typically conservative stance.The consensus from a survey by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S of 26 analysts, however, calls for Toyota’s operating profit to rise to another record of 2.66 trillion yen ($26 billion), albeit with growth of a much more modest 10 percent after last year’s estimated 80 percent surge.“We cannot rule out the possibility operating profit guidance will be flat or down year-on-year,�� Tokyo-based Barclays autos analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said in a report, though he himself forecasted growth. Much will depend on currency rates and other assumptions, he said.Toyota declined to comment on financial results or forecasts ahead of the actual announcement.The dollar has surged more than 25 percent against the yen over the past 17 months, spurred by Abe’s easy-money policies, and the auto industry has been a big beneficiary, especially export-oriented Toyota, Mazda Motor Corp and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.In 2013, Japan’s auto exports jumped 13 percent to 10.4 trillion yen, while their share of the country’s total exports edged up 0.5 percentage point to 14.9 percent.Currency gains lifted operating profit at Japan’s seven car makers by 1.6 trillion yen in the nine months to December. At Toyota, yen weakness will account for more than four-fifths of its expected operating profit rise in 2013/14.In the current year from April 1, however, Barclays�� Yoshida forecast that currency moves would cut Toyota’s operating profit by 20 billion yen.The hit to auto-sector profits could sap momentum in what has been a particularly resilient sector in Japanese manufacturing.Nagoya and the surrounding region of central Japan, home to Toyota and its suppliers, is one of the country’s best-performing regional economies, according to a recent Bank of Japan report.Toyota also set the benchmark for a series of wage increases this spring sought by the prime minister to take his “Abenomics�� policies beyond the initial burst of stimulus into a sustainable cycle of income, spending and investment growth.But the Toyota executives interviewed over the past week, with their guarded outlook, were in no mood to spend freely.“If we make plans based on the pace of growth we have experienced over the last few years, things will not turn out well,�� one executive said, warning of the risk of over-expansion and overcapacity.The slow-and-steady pace is consistent with the conservative stance taken by President Akio Toyoda, the 57-year-old grandson of the car maker’s founder, since he took the helm five years ago.Toyoda has led a recovery from losses suffered in the global financial crisis and a hit to the company’s reputation from a global recall after cases of unintended acceleration.He blamed overly aggressive expansion for the problems behind the recall and for overcapacity at the car maker, even as it rose to number one in the global industry.The company has since stopped emphasising numerical sales targets, in contrast to Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn’s aggressive target, set seven years ago, of selling 10 million cars a year by 2018.Both companies now look set to hit the 10 million cars milestone this year, and Volkswagen could overtake Toyota within the next few years, said Satomi Hamada, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive.She said the pace of growth in traditional Toyota strongholds such as Japan, Thailand and North America would slow. In China, however, now the world’s biggest car market with growth expected to remain brisk, Volkswagen is a dominant player, outdistancing Toyota and other Japanese carmakers.President Toyoda’s comments suggest he is likely unfazed by that prospect.“If a tree suddenly grows very fast, the rings of the trunk will be unstable and the tree weak,�� he told reporters in December. “Growing constantly at a steady pace is what helps to build a strong trunk.�� ($1 = 101.8500 Japanese Yen) (Editing by Edmund Klamann and Alex Richardson)	1.050981838
(Adds quotes, background)JAKARTA, March 16 (Reuters) - Car sales in Indonesia leapt 24.2 percent year-on-year in February as increased supply met pent-up demand among consumers in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.Sales of cars in February rose to 86,407 cars, led by Toyota, Daihatsu, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, and Nissan, according to data from the Indonesia’s Automotive Manufacturers Association (Gaikindo) on Friday.Sales of cars and motorbikes are an important indicator of consumption in Indonesia, a country with 6.5 percent growth in 2011 and a rapidly expanding middle class.On a monthly basis, domestic car sales grew 13.2 percent, said the association and revised January sales to 76,365 cars. Average car sales growth in 2011 stood at 18.2 percent.“It’s more about supply issues. Toyota has delivered its new variant to consumers and Honda has started to recover after supply disruption from Thailand,�� Adrian Joezer, analyst at Mandiri Sekuritas told Reuters on Friday.Data from Indonesia’s main auto assembler PT Astra International Tbk showed that Toyota sold a total of 33,593 cars in February and grew 15 percent from a month earlier. Sales of Honda rose 22.6 percent month-on-month in February to 1,904 cars.On Friday, the government and Bank Indonesia issued regulations that set minimum down payments for loans of private cars and motorbikes, both for banks and multifinances.The regulations came a week after the government proposed a fuel price hike plan to parliament to help the state cope with the rising cost of subsidies amid increasing crude oil prices.“Most of the consumers are first time buyers. In 2008, when fuel was hiked by 30 percent, the impact was only for a month and then rebounded afterwards,�� said Joezer, adding that buyers of cars are more sensitive to financing liquidity issues.Last year the country booked a new sales record of 894,180 cars, up 16 percent from 2010.“The issue of rising lending rates will give negative sentiment. In February, consumers were still waiting to see the impact of fuel policies,�� said Akhmad Nurcahyadi, an analyst at Jakarta-based BNI Sekuritas.The worries about increasing transportation costs will likely be seen after the implementation of the new fuel policy and could affect sales in March or April, said Nurcahyadi.

BERLIN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Volkswagen is hoping a sleek makeover will keep its Golf in the best-selling compact car spot, helping the German automaker overtake Toyota and GM as the world leaders.But the mid-range vehicle faces an onslaught of competition from cheaper and premium models, just as car makers grapple with an economic slump in Europe and slowing growth in China.VW has reported record deliveries and higher profits while rivals have struggled. However the seventh-generation Golf, to be unveiled in Berlin on Tuesday, may not be enough to keep Europe’s biggest automaker on its winning streak, analysts say.“Success of the new Golf is absolutely critical to VW’s expansion targets but the new version will be battling in a tough environment,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne, Germany.Volkswagen is on course to bump General Motors into the world no.3 ranking this year. It aims to sell a world-leading 10 million vehicles by 2018, up from the 8.36 million recorded last year, and push past Toyota.The new hatchback will boast a range of features aimed at luring buyers away from cheaper rivals made by Hyundai, Skoda and Seat, volume makers including Peugeot Citroen and GM’s Opel division, as well as from Audi and BMW at the top end.Pricing has not yet been announced for the new Golf, which will be sleeker and more than 100 kilograms lighter than its predecessor, thanks to increased use of ultra-strong steel, making it cheaper to run and cutting emissions.The 140-horsepower petrol version will produce an average 112 grams of CO2 per kilometer, complying with European Union targets. It will also be 2.24 inches longer and 0.52 inches wider than its predecessor, enlarging the interior to compete more effectively with SUVs and minivans.To attract luxury buyers, VW is touting a higher quality cockpit finish with more screens and driving assistance gadgets aimed at fending off a sporty replacement of Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz A-Class and the new BMW 1-Series introduced last year.This may still not be enough to keep the competition at bay.“The European (compact) market is fully saturated and the Golf keeps attracting competition, even from within the VW group,�� said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, citing the Audi, Skoda and Seat brands.“It’s no synonym for future growth.”Research firm IHS Automotive is confident the Golf, with over 29 million global sales since its 1974 launch as the iconic Beetle’s successor, will keep the top spot.Sales will rise 17.3 percent to 630,000 units by 2017, it predicts, followed by Toyota’s Prius with an 18.7 percent gain to 488,000 and Ford’s Focus with a 2.4 percent decline to 443,000.But there are signs the company is worried.With its affiliate Kia Motors, Hyundai is the envy of global rivals such as VW, outgrowing the market during a severe downturn by offering stylish models at affordable prices backed by savvy - if sometimes risky - promotions and helped by a cheaper currency.VW views Hyundai as a serious contender. Checking out a Hyundai model at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, chief executive Martin Winterkorn was caught on camera examining the steering wheel adjustment, and saying: “Nothing rattles ... Why can they do it? BMW can’t. We can’t.”The YouTube video has had almost 1.8 million hits.A risk for VW is that it is building its updated bread-and-butter car on a new modular platform, that will allow it to enhance parts-sharing among its car brands.While the new technology aims to make production of 3.5 million small- and mid-sized cars 20 percent cheaper, and shorten assembly by 30 percent, the scaling up means any defects could expose VW to the kind of mass recalls that blighted Toyota Motor Corp in 2009-2010.The updated Audi A3 compact, a competitor from within the VW family stable, will be built using the same cost-saving architecture.The Golf is so crucial to VW’s success that it is the only model the company builds on four continents.VW expanded production of the Golf to a new plant in Osnabrueck, Germany last year, even as the financial crisis exposed chronic overcapacity elsewhere in Europe, forcing rivals Fiat and Opel to close factories in Sicily and Belgium.“The Golf has a preeminent role at VW because of its high production volumes,�� VW brand development chief Ulrich Hackenberg said recently. “It’s the face of VW.��	0.3175409628

DETROIT (Reuters) - The top six automakers sold more cars and trucks in November than analysts expected, with a healthy economy, generous discounts and low fuel prices luring consumers into U.S. showrooms.The industry’s annualized sales rate in November was about 17.2 million vehicles, according to industry consultant Autodata Corp. That is the best pace for that month since 2003 and well ahead of the estimated 16.7 million in a Thomson Reuters survey of 41 industry economists and analysts.November sales totaled 1.3 million, up 4.6 percent from a year ago and higher than analysts�� expectations of 1.27 million.“This sustained demand for new vehicles was building for years during the recession, and it should continue unless a major shift in economic stability occurs,�� said analyst Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book.General Motors Co, Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co all reported year-to-year sales gains in November, while Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd had modest declines. All six topped forecasts from analysts surveyed by Reuters.Early buzz and promotions tied to the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday�� retail blitz helped spur car sales, according to John Krafcik, president of online shopping service TrueCar.com. Krafcik said average transaction prices on full-size pickups in November topped $40,000 for the first time.GM on Tuesday said November sales rose 6.5 percent to 225,818 vehicles. Sales of GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups climbed 34 percent to 65,343.“Lower gasoline prices are helping the entire market, not just SUVs and trucks,�� said GM spokesman Jim Cain, who also cited improving consumer confidence, higher wages and lower unemployment.Chrysler Group sales rose 20.1 percent to 170,839 vehicles on strong showings by its Jeep utility vehicles and Ram trucks. Ram pickup sales were up 21 percent, while Jeep SUV sales jumped 27 percent.Ford reported a slight decline in sales to 186,334 vehicles, about what analysts had expected. Sales of the best-selling F-150 pickup were down 10 percent to 59,049 as the automaker began a changeover to the redesigned 2015 model.Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said plunging fuel prices have provided a “financial windfall�� for buyers, bolstered by still-low interest rates.“By any measure, households are reaping significant disposable income gains each week at current gas prices,�� she said.Toyota said sales rose 3 percent to 183,343, while Honda reported an increase of nearly 9 percent to 121,814. Nissan said sales were down 3 percent to 103,188. All three companies beat analysts�� expectations.	-1.597369039

(Reuters) - Sebastien Loeb became at 46 the oldest driver to lead a round of the world rally championship after ending Friday’s opening leg of Rally Turkey with a 1.2 seconds advantage over Hyundai team mate Thierry Neuville.The Frenchman, a nine times world champion and three times Rally Turkey winner who now races only in selected events, was competing for the first time since January’s Monte Carlo season-opener.Turkey is the fifth round of the championship.“I didn’t expect to be leading tonight,�� he told the wrc.com website after the two short and dusty evening speed tests totalling a mere 25.22km.“The last stage, I had a lot of pressure at the start because we didn’t find the road so good. I had precise notes so I was able to do it and leading the rally tonight is the best thing that can happen.”Toyota’s championship leader Sebastien Ogier, who won six titles in a row after compatriot Loeb retired from full-time rallying, was in third place and a tenth of a second behind Neuville.Team mates Elfyn Evans and Kalle Rovanpera were fourth and fifth.Estonian world champion Ott Tanak was in seventh place for Hyundai but only 4.8 seconds off the lead.Saturday is the rally’s longest leg, covering 107.38km west of Marmaris with a loop of three coastal stages in the morning and repeated again in the afternoon with a service stop in between.The overall positions after leg one are reversed to set the road order for the second leg.“Running first on the road, it was slippery like we expected so it was definitely challenging,�� said Ogier.	-0.2591068435

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Nikkei average is expected to open stronger and test a 20-month high on Thursday, led by exporters, as the new Japanese prime minister’s vow to battle deflation and a strong currency sent the yen to a more than two-year low against the dollar.Separately, Finance Minister Taro Aso said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has ordered him to compile a stimulus package without adhering to a previously agreed cap on new bond issuance, signaling a more aggressive policy to kick-start the ailing economy.The Nikkei .N225 is likely to trade between 10,250 and 10,400, strategists said, while Nikkei futures in Chicago closed at 10,330 on Wednesday, up 0.9 percent from the Osaka close of 10,240.“The Nikkei will test the year-to-date’s high. Nikkei futures already cleared above 10,300 in yesterday’s night session,�� said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Inc. “The yen depreciation continues.”Hiroki said expectations of further gains in the new year would likely deter investors from sharp profit-taking on Friday, the last trading day of the year.The yen was quoted at 85.50 to the dollar on Thursday after hitting a more than two-year low of 85.735 yen on Wednesday.On Wednesday, the Nikkei climbed 1.4 percent to 10,230.36, hitting a nine-month high and coming close to this year's high of 10,255.15 reached in late March. The broader Topix .TOPX index advanced 1.2 percent to 847.71.The benchmark Nikkei has rallied 18.1 percent over the past six weeks, taking the year-to-date gain for the Nikkei to 21 percent, outpacing a 12.9 percent rise in the U.S. S&amp;P 500 .INX and a 14.7 percent gain in the pan-European STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX.Japanese equities carry a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.6, slightly cheaper than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.8 but more expensive than STOXX Europe 600’s 11.5, data from Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.&gt; Wall St drops for 3rd day, led by retailers .N &gt; Yen falls sharply as Japan's Abe vows to weaken it FRX &gt; Treasuries gain as U.S. fiscal deadline approaches &lt;US/&gt; &gt; Gold up in thin post-Christmas trade; US budget in focus&lt;GOL/&gt; &gt; Oil jumps to 9-week high on U.S. fiscal talks, technicals&lt;O/R&gt;-- TOYOTA MOTOR CORP 7203.TToyota has agreed to pay as much as $1.4 billion to settle U.S. litigation over claims that its vehicles suddenly and unintentionally accelerated, according to court filings made public on Wednesday.-- MITSUBISHI UFJ FINANCIAL GROUP 8306.TVietinBank CTG.HM, Vietnam's second-biggest partly private lender by assets, is set to sign a deal to sell shares to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, making the Japanese lender its strategic investor, a VietinBank official said on Wednesday.	6.352368305
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to announce on Tuesday it is finalizing its effort to roll back Obama era vehicle emissions rules and will mandate average annual increases in fuel efficiency standards of 1.5% through 2026, three people briefed on the matter said.In August 2018, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through 2026, reversing Obama-era standards that called for about 5% annual increases.The new rules, which must be finalized by April 1 in order to revise the 2022 model year requirements, is a jump over the initial proposal but will still result in significantly lower overall fleet fuel efficiency, environmentalists said.Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler said on Twitter on Monday that the final rule will raise U.S. fleet fuel economy, reduce air pollution and “make new vehicles more affordable.”California and 22 other U.S. states plan to challenge the rewrite. They previously challenged the Trump administration’s decision to revoke California’s authority to set stiff vehicle tailpipe emissions rules.Court battles will leave automakers in limbo. The fate of vehicle emissions standards may rest on who wins the Nov. 3 presidential election. Democratic candidate Joe Biden vows to toughen fuel economy standards to ensure ��100% of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be electrified.”U.S. Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said, “This legally flawed rule means more uncertainty and more litigation. This rule will not provide regulatory relief to automakers, it will do just the opposite.”The Obama standards, adopted in 2012, sought to raise fuel efficiency standards to an estimated 46.7 mpg by 2026, which officials had said would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and eliminate 2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.Carper said earlier this year the draft proposal would result in a 40.5 mpg average for the combined fleet by 2030.A draft final proposal circulated by the administration this year proposed to increase requirements by about 1.5% per year. It is not clear what additional compliance flexibilities the administration will include.John Bozzella, who heads an automotive trade representing nearly all major automakers including General Motors Co GM.N, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, said automakers would review the final rule when published.“A lot of the planning for these model years has already been done,�� Bozzella said, adding policymakers should now look at longer-term requirements beyond 2026.Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, called the expected final regulation “a massive transfer of tens of billions of dollars from drivers to oil companies, as consumers will spend more on gasoline due to less efficient cars.��	3.034597749
* Nikkei pulls back from 17,000 resistance as yen pares losses* Suzuki shares rise on news of possible Toyota tie-upTOKYO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average gave up early gains and slipped on Thursday as the yen clawed back ground it had lost to the dollar.The Nikkei slipped 0.4 percent by midday to 16,774.26, moving away from last Friday’s five-week highs.“Resistance for the Nikkei lies around 17,000 today, and it is foreign exchange that largely determines whether or not it would be broken,�� said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.The dollar skidded 0.5 percent to 103.59 yen, moving away from its Wednesday high of 104.49 yen, which was its highest level since late July.The greenback had gotten a lift overnight after minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting showed several voting policy members believed a rate hike would be warranted “relatively soon�� if the U.S. economy continued to strengthen.“The minutes last night boosted sentiment for a sooner-rather-than-later rate hike in the states,�� which lifted the dollar, said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading in Hong Kong.“So 17,000 has been very much a resistance level, and given the fact this morning that the yen had already broken down through the 104 handle, there just wasn’t that momentum.”Domestic economic concerns also remained.These were underscored by a report in the Sankei newspaper on Thursday that said the Bank of Japan was likely to cut its consumer inflation forecast for the 2017 fiscal year to the lower 1 percent zone, from its current 1.7 percent for the fiscal year starting in April, as a stronger yen, weak oil prices and sluggish consumer spending curb inflation.Downbeat data from China was likely to weigh on sentiment in the afternoon session. China’s September exports fell 10 percent from a year earlier, more than markets had expected, while imports also fell 1.9 percent, official data showed on Thursday.Shares of Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp rose 0.2 percent and 2 percent, respectively, after the two automakers said on Wednesday that they plan to explore a possible partnership, citing technological challenges and the need to keep up with consolidation in the global auto industry.Hoya Corp shares fell 1.9 percent after the Japanese optical device maker said on Wednesday that it will acquire Performance Optics of the U.S. for about $476 million.The broader Topix was down 0.1 percent at midday at 1,340.48.The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 slipped 0.2 percent to 11,993.87.

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Shinzo Abe’s so-so victory in Japanese elections over the weekend will keep his focus on the Japanese economy, where it should be. The prime minister’s ruling coalition won a majority in Japan’s upper house, but slack turnout denied him enough seats to scrap the country’s constitutional commitment to pacifism. That clears away an unhelpful political distraction.The world’s third-largest economy is having a rough year. Better workforce participation, inflation and business investment have been offset by trade war tensions. The benchmark Topix index is down roughly 5% from the year’s peak in April. U.S. President Donald Trump has deemed automobile imports a security risk, threatening an industry that is one of Japan’s largest employers. And Toyko has unwisely lowered itself into a trade spat with South Korea, a major market for Japanese products ranging from electronics to beer.A strengthening yen is a bigger potential headache. The soft currency supported Japanese exporters, and also helped the country sustain its unorthodox monetary policy. Stock market heavyweights like $187 billion automaker Toyota Motor have baked exchange rates of around 110 yen to the dollar into their sales forecasts - and Topix-listed companies earn two-thirds of their revenue overseas, according to Wisdomtree estimates. If the yen firms, the reported value of sales outside from Japan mathematically decreases �� more bad news for equities.The risk of a further yen rally rises as other central banks consider easing, as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and European Central Bank have signalled. Japan’s benchmark interest rates are around zero so they can’t really go lower. Lower yields on U.S. sovereign bonds will increase the relative attractiveness of their Japanese equivalents to investors, pushing the currency up further. That will make it even harder for Japan to put rates up and prune massive government debts incurred by stimulus efforts. A weak economy could also throw a wrench into Abe’s plans to hike the sales tax.Had Abe’s coalition won two-thirds of the upper house, his administration might have turned to pushing through a controversial constitutional amendment releasing the Japanese army from pacifist constraints. But trade wars, not real wars, are the areas in which his efforts are best focused.	-0.9608052463
BRUSSELS, Nov 14 (Reuters) - EU competition regulators gave Japanese conglomerate Toyota Tsusho Corp (TTC) the go-ahead on Wednesday for its acquisition of trading company CFAO.The European Commission, which acts as competition watchdog for the 27-member country European Union, said it had no concerns about the acquisition of CFAO, which distributes vehicles and medicines in Africa and French overseas territories.The Commission said in a statement it had looked at the impact of the deal on the Toyota vehicle parts market in French Guiana.��...If the merged entity tried to raise its prices or cut back on supplies of Toyota spare parts to independent repairers, the latter would be able to source Toyota spare parts from other readily available channels in metropolitan France or other neighbouring countries, such as Suriname or the Caribbean,�� the Commission said.In July, Toyota Tsusho Corp acquired a 29.8 percent stake in CFAO held by luxury and retail group PPR and later launched a tender offer for the trading company.

* Japan automakers say almost no disruptions in Thai operations* Appetite for investment into Thailand still strong-lobby head (Adds Toyota quote, information on plant operations, auto sales figures)TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Thailand’s military coup is unlikely to pose major risks for Japanese car makers, the head of Japan’s auto lobby said on Tuesday, as companies say they have so far seen almost no impact on their operations in the country.Fumihiko Ike, chairman of Honda Motor Co and the head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, also said that even though auto sales have plunged over the last year after a subsidy programme ended, appetite for investment into Thailand, an export hub for Japanese automakers, remains strong.“Thailand of course poses risks as a country, but if you ask me whether they are major country risks, I personally do not think that they will have a very big impact on business activities,�� he told reporters.The auto sector in Thailand, dominated by Japanese car makers including Toyota Motor Corp, Honda and Nissan Motor Co, has been hit by a weakened economy and months of political unrest, topped by a coup last week when army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha took control of the government.Ike said that Thailand’s auto sales decline since May 2013 has largely been due to the fading effects of a government subsidy programme for first car buyers, which ended in 2012, rather than political unrest.Auto sales in April dropped 33.2 percent on the year, data from the Federation of Thai Industries showed.Toyota, the best selling car maker in Thailand, posted a 31 percent sales drop in January-April. Honda has been hit harder, with its January-March sales down 69 percent, and it has warned it could miss its sales target.Thailand accounted for 4.5 percent of Toyota’s global sales and 3.8 percent for Honda last financial year.Toyota’s Executive Vice President Nobuyori Kodaira also said on Tuesday that the company is watching the situation in Thailand closely.Toyota cancelled its night shift on May 22 when the coup took place but since then has been operating its plants as usual. Nissan said there has been no disruption to production and Honda is also running its factories as usual.Despite the political crisis and the drop in domestic sales, Thailand’s role as an export hub is unlikely to change anytime soon, said Honda’s Ike.While companies are increasingly investing in Indonesia and India, Thailand still has an edge with its strong supplier network built over decades and export-friendly policies, he said, adding: “I think appetite for investment still remains strong.�� (Reporting by Yoko Kubota; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim/Jeremy Gaunt)	8.124829406
WARSAW, April 5 (Reuters) - New car registrations in Poland jumped 24.6 percent last month from a year earlier to their highest in 17 years, data from the Samar research institute showed on Wednesday.New registrations totalled 55,526 in March, the most since December 1999 and up 28.9 percent from February, the privately-run institute said.“Institutional clients are currently the driving force of registrations,�� Samar said in a statement, adding individuals were predominantly buying used cars.Samar estimated about 9.5 percent of the cars were exported out of Poland shortly after their registration in March.Registrations have now risen in annual terms for 24 consecutive months and have been growing at double-digit percentage rates since November.Poland’s $450 billion economy grew at its fastest quarterly pace in a decade at the end of 2016, underpinned by record low unemployment, a new child benefit and signs the flow of European Union aid has accelerated after a sharp contraction.Top-selling car models in Poland this year have been the Skoda Fabia and Skoda Octavia, produced by Skoda, the Czech subsidiary of Volkswagen.These models were followed by the Opel Astra, produced by Germany’s Opel AG, and the Toyota Yaris.

(Reuters) - General Motors GM.N and Honda Motor Co 7267.T on Thursday revealed plans to team up in North America to make a range of vehicles, deepening their ties as the auto industry comes under greater pressure to share technology and costs to meet demands for cleaner vehicles.Under the alliance, Honda and GM said, the companies intend to share common vehicle platforms, including electrified and internal combustion propulsion systems.The companies still need to complete a definitive agreement and officials said greater details on expected cost savings would be available then, but a person familiar with the matter said the savings would run in the billions of dollars for each company.The partnership represents a significant expansion of existing collaborations between the two companies on electric and autonomous vehicles, connected vehicle technology and fuel cells. Honda is an investor in Cruise, the self-driving business that GM majority owns.“Overall, we believe this alliance would help both companies realize significant cost savings in the development of our vehicle portfolios,�� GM President Mark Reuss said in a statement.The deal marks another milestone in the consolidation of the global auto industry, as pressures to cut emissions and move toward EVs strain the capital and engineering resources of even the largest players.Former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) FCHA.MI Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne had for years pushed for consolidation in the global auto industry, arguing it was inevitable to manage prohibitive capital costs.FCA announced a $50 billion merger with France's PSA PEUP.PA last year to create the world's fourth largest carmaker, Stellantis, in a move to address cost and scale issues. That deal is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021.Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has been expanding ties with smaller Japanese automakers such as Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Subaru 9778.T. Ford Motor Co F.N and German automaker Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE have forged a wide-ranging alliance covering electric and commercial vehicles and autonomous driving technology. Analysts and GM investors have been pushing for a transformational change at the Detroit automaker, with repeated questions around the spinoff of its EV operations into a separate company. GM CEO Mary Barra has said such an option was not off the table.GM and Honda said in April they would jointly develop two new EVs for Honda and were planning to explore more ways to expand their alliance. They have already worked together on the design of an autonomous vehicle called Cruise Origin, and also collaborated on fuel cells and batteries.Honda has for years remained largely independent, staying clear of industry mergers. But the GM alliance will give it economies of scale it cannot achieve on its own, Honda Executive Vice President Seji Kuraishi said. North America is Honda’s largest market and GM’s second largest behind China.GM and Honda said joint development discussions will begin immediately, with engineering work starting in early 2021.The companies plan to explore vehicle platform-sharing possibilities in more than four core segments including crossovers and midsized pickup trucks, along with propulsion systems, infotainment and connectivity services, advanced driver-assist features, vehicle connectivity and other technology. They also will cooperate on purchasing.Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said in a research note that it was “encouraging�� to see the companies teaming up on gasoline-powered engines as that technology still requires investment even as the industry shifts to EVs.	-0.8034842682

BEIJING, March 3 (Reuters) - China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group said on Tuesday it was investing 2.27 billion yuan ($326 million) in a new satellite manufacturing plant, where it plans to build low-orbit satellites to provide more accurate data for self-driving cars.Geely, one of China’s most internationally-known companies due to its investments in Daimler, Volvo and Proton, is building the facilities in Taizhou, where it has car plants. It aims to produce 500 satellites a year by around 2025, with around 300 highly-skilled staff, it said in a statement.Geely’s technology development arm, Geely Technology Group, launched Geespace to research, launch, and operate low-orbit satellites in 2018.Geespace will begin the launch of its commercial low-orbit satellite network by the end of this year, Geely said.Geely said low-orbit satellites would offer high speed internet connectivity, precise navigation, and cloud computing capabilities to cars with autonomous driving technology.Geely, which sold 2.18 million cars last year, is among global automakers from Tesla to Toyota to pursue autonomous driving technologies.It is building low-orbit satellites to meet demand for high-speed connectivity capabilities that can deliver fast software updates.

(Rewrites headline and lead; adds details)BEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China’s vehicle market, the world’s biggest, may expand 7 percent this year, roughly matching last year’s growth, although just half the pace of 2013 as the economy slows, an industry body said on Monday.The slowdown has fuelled tension between global automakers and China’s car dealers, who accuse brands such as BMW and Toyota Motor Corp of setting unrealistic targets and forcing them to buy more cars than they can sell.China’s economy is embracing the “new normal�� of slower growth, and the auto market is also entering an era of “stable increase,�� the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) told a news conference in the capital.The CAAM forecasts China vehicle sales, which include passenger cars and commercial vehicles, to grow 7 percent to 25.1 million units this year, in line with economic growth. That is similar to the pace of 6.9 percent in 2014.But some analysts are more pessimistic, predicting weaker appetite for cars in an economy that may cool further this year, after expanding last year at its slowest in 24 years.China’s auto market growth could slow further this year, to 3 percent to 4 percent, said Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.“Growth figures will likely be ugly,�� he said, citing factors such as continued sluggishness of the economy, a larger comparative base, and dealers�� backlash against automakers.Chinese dealers of BMW, Porsche and a Toyota Chinese venture have banded together in talks with the carmakers over subsidies and sales targets, as they fight over who should bear the brunt of slower growth.Reflecting diverging fortunes, Volkswagen AG, which grabbed the top spot last year in a close race with General Motors Co, has said it is ramping up expansion in China to keep up with demand.Ford Motor Co, which has overtaken Japanese rival Toyota in China, also attributed a recent slowdown in sales there to a shortfall in production capacity.

Kyle Busch grabs overtime Xfinity win at BristolBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeBRISTOL, Tenn. -- When Chris Buescher’s Ford faltered on a green-white-checkered restart on Friday night at Bristol Motor Speedway, Kyle Busch took full advantage, as is his custom.In a Food City 300 that went to two laps of overtime at the .533-mile short track, Busch finished .427 of a second ahead of Kyle Larson, as Buescher faded to 11th after his car failed to pick up fuel off Turn 2 of the next-to-last lap.The victory was Busch’s third of the season in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, his eighth at Bristol and the 73rd of his career, extending his own series record.“This is home -- this is where I’m supposed to be,�� Busch said, standing outside the car in Victory Lane. “I wish I was here Wednesday night (after the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race), so we could continue the sweep lookout for (Saturday), but that was a second place. Oh, well.”Pole-sitter Denny Hamlin ran third, followed by Ty Dillon and Daniel Suarez, who got a bonus for his top-five run. As the highest finishing eligible driver in the Xfinity Dash 4 Cash program, Suarez picked up an extra $100,000.Pit strategy put Buescher at the front of the field under the fourth caution of the race, caused by Cale Conley’s spin in Turn 4. On older tires, Buescher nevertheless pulled away from Busch during a succession of restarts, as Busch saved his equipment for what he thought would be the inevitable late-race caution.“I let the 60 (Buescher) go,�� Busch said. “He ran out there to about a straightaway on us, and I was just trying to save and do what I could to keep my tires underneath me. I knew we were going to get some cautions at the end to bunch us back up, and fortunately we did.“I wasn’t sure they were going to make it on fuel (having pitted on lap 131 of 302), and obviously they cut it close -- a little too close.”Busch got the yellow he needed just in time. Brad Teague’s wreck on the frontstretch with five laps left set up the green-white-checkered and gave Busch the chance he needed.Buescher, who saw his series lead shrink to 19 points over Ty Dillon, knew he could have made it to the end on fuel had the race not gone to overtime.NASCAR Xfinity Series Race - Food City 300Bristol Motor SpeedwayBristol, TennesseeFriday, August 21, 20151.

WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - A group of 23 U.S. states led by California, the District of Columbia and some major cities are challenging a Trump administration decision to weaken Obama administration fuel efficiency standards.In March, the Trump administration issued final rules requiring 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - far weaker than the 5% increases in the discarded Obama-era rules - but abandoned its August 2018 proposal to freeze requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.Last week, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Toyota Motor Corp and others sided with the Trump administration on its plan and opposed a legal challenge to further weaken the requirements. Other automakers including Ford Motor Co are not backing the administration plan.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the revised requirements “will increase costs to consumers and allow the emission of dangerous pollutants that directly threaten the health of our communities.�� (Reporting by David Shepardson)	-1.145216578

TOYOTA CITY, Japan/IRVINE, California (Reuters) - In 1997, Toyota caught its competitors by surprise with the revolutionary Prius, the first commercially successful gasoline-electric hybrid car. Now, the Japanese firm is trying to do the same with a technology that seems straight out of science fiction.Toyota Motor Corp will next year launch a hydrogen-powered car in the United States, Japan and Europe. For now, people at Toyota are calling it the 2015 FC car, for fuel-cell.Fuel-cell cars use a “stack�� of cells that electro-chemically combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity that helps propel the car. Their only emission, bar heat, is water vapor, they can run five times longer than battery electric cars, and it takes just minutes to fill the tank with hydrogen - far quicker than even the most rapid charger can recharge a battery electric car.The 2015 launch culminates a 20-year zig-zag quest during which Toyota first struggled to get the technology to work and then strained to lower manufacturing costs enough to permit realistic pricing. It has also been playing catch-up to rival Honda Motor Co, which has set the early pace with its FCX Clarity, a sleek, purpose-built hydrogen car.The cost-cutting continues, though Toyota thinks it has cracked the code with incremental design improvements, such as using wider, flatter “fettuccine-style�� copper in coils that make the motor more powerful, and thus smaller and cheaper.“With the 2015 FC car we think we’ve achieved a degree of dominance over our rivals,�� Satoshi Ogiso, a Toyota managing director, said in a recent interview at the group’s global headquarters. “With the car, we make a first giant step�� toward making fuel-cell vehicles practical for everyday use.What’s more, executives and engineers say Toyota is willing to sell the car at a loss for a long while to popularize the new technology - just as it did with the Prius, which, with other hybrids, now accounts for 14 percent of Toyota’s annual sales, excluding group companies, of around 9 million vehicles.As a result, drivers in key “green�� markets such as California may be able to buy the car for a little more than $30,000-$40,000, after government subsidies - if management approves a pricing strategy put forward by a group of managers and engineers. General Motors Co’s Chevrolet Volt, a near-all-electric plug-in hybrid, for comparison, starts at around $35,000 in the United States.The stakes are high - for global automakers, oil producers, economies, and the environment.As with battery electric cars, a major challenge for fuel-cell automakers is a lack of infrastructure, with few hydrogen fuel stations in the world. Estimates vary, but it costs about $2 million to build a single hydrogen fuel station in the United States, according to Toyota executives.Safety is also a concern. Hydrogen is a highly flammable element when not handled properly.The Toyota launch pits fuel-cell technology against battery electric in a race to capture the hearts and wallets of drivers looking for engines that are easier on the environment. Automakers are under pressure to invest in so-called “zero-emission�� cars as tougher rules globally demand lower harmful emissions and better fuel economy.It’s a polarizing debate.Takeshi Uchiyamada, the 67-year-old “father of the Prius�� whose success catapulted him from mid-level engineer to Toyota board chairman, says technology inefficiencies will make the battery electric car little more than an “errands car�� - a small run-around for shopping, dropping the kids at school and other short-haul chores.Other global automakers in the fuel-cell camp include Daimler AG, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda, which plans to introduce an upgraded FCX Clarity next year with seating for five, a smaller fuel-cell stack, greater power and a longer driving range.Those betting on battery electric cars include Nissan Motor Co, Tesla Motors Inc, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, GM, Ford Motor Co and Chinese automakers backed by the country’s industrial policymakers. China offers generous purchase incentives for those buying battery electric cars and aims to have 5 million “new energy�� vehicles - mostly all-electric and near all-electric plug-in hybrids - on the road by 2020. Several of these will be exhibited at the Beijing auto show from April 20.Tesla chief Elon Musk has said hydrogen is an unsuitable fuel for cars. In a videotaped speech last year to employees and others at a new Tesla service center in Germany, Musk said: “Fuel-cell is so bullshit. Hydrogen is a quite dangerous gas. It’s suitable for the upper-stage rocket, but not for cars.”Even Toyota only expects tens of thousands of fuel-cell cars to be sold each year a decade from now as the new technology will need time to gain traction.It’s been a long road for Toyota to get this far.Ogiso, who was part of the team that came up with the Prius and now leads the development of hydrogen cars, likens the two-decade effort to “racing cars in dark tunnels.”�You don’t know whether you’re ahead or behind,�� said the 53-year-old engineer-turned executive.Just a decade ago, it cost more than $1 million to manufacture a fuel-cell vehicle propulsion system. Toyota has whittled down those costs and overcome technological hurdles, such as how to start the car in very cold weather.In October 2003, a materials researcher at Toyota’s tech center in Ann Arbor, Michigan gave a presentation in which he highlighted the difficulty his team faced in solving this issue. Shortly afterwards, rival Honda said it developed a fuel-cell car that could run in temperatures as low as minus 20 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). “It was embarrassing, and we were yelled at by the big bosses,�� recalled a person familiar with the incident.Five years later, there was more embarrassment at the hands of Honda - what Toyota fuel-cell engineers call the “Clarity shock�� - referring to Honda’s launch of the FCX Clarity. “Honda built every part of that from the ground up, and it had cool styling,�� said a Toyota engineer who has been on the fuel-cell team for more than a decade. “It sent shockwaves through our team.”On a single floor of Toyota’s research tower, across the street from the Tokyo headquarters, some 200 material scientists, chemists, computer programmers and mechanical engineers worked to nail down the hydrogen electric fuel-cell technology they needed.A sizeable chunk of the cost savings has come from using less platinum as a catalyst in the electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in fuel economies. Toyota says its 2015 hydrogen car should drive 700 km (435 miles) on a single tank, more than many conventional gasoline-engine cars, and a strong selling point to those worried about driving range.Ogiso and his engineers are reluctant to talk specifically about how they made their breakthrough, but noted Toyota’s expertise in nanotechnology, allowing them to shrink platinum particles to better combine oxygen and hydrogen and generate more electricity. That allowed them to reduce the size of the cell stack and use less fuel to make the car go farther.Ogiso says Toyota has cut the platinum use per car by more than two-thirds through nanotechnology and stack-design improvements, and he expects to trim that further. Engineer Hitoshi Nomasa said a hydrogen-powered Toyota SUV now uses around 30 grams of platinum in the fuel-cell, down from 100 grams previously. Platinum currently costs $1,437 an ounce (28 grams) on world markets.Toyota has also borrowed spare parts from the Prius and other gasoline-electric hybrids it sells around the world. While the fuel-cell car uses hydrogen as fuel, it otherwise resembles the hybrid models as both use electricity to power their motors.“Very roughly ... under the hood of the 2015 FC car lie more or less the exact same components used for the Prius and other hybrids,�� said another Toyota fuel-cell engineer, referring to the electric motor, “transaxle�� gear and hybrid battery pack, among the parts lifted from the hybrid spares bin.Even the incremental advance with the “fettuccine coils�� - the wide, flat-shaped copper wire can bind the coil more tightly and needs less space - took the Toyota team a decade to hone.While costs have come down significantly, Toyota says a hydrogen car’s fuel-cell propulsion system alone still costs it close to $50,000 to produce. That’s partly why some Toyota money managers want a more conservative pricing strategy - of $50,000-$100,000 - said one individual on the 2015 FC car launch team.“It might be tough to price it below $50,000,�� Ogiso said. “But anything is possible at this point.��	0.546195149

The shelf registration is effective for two years from Aug. 22, 2012.The ratings on Toyota Tsusho reflect the company’s stable earnings and good asset quality--both of which stem from its position as the trading arm of the Toyota Motor Corp. (AA-/Negative/A-1+) group--and our expectations that the company will generate stronger profits and diversify through expansion of its nonauto businesses in the medium term. The company’s low risk appetite, stringent risk management, and conservative financial policy make material deterioration in its financial risk profile unlikely, in our opinion. We also consider the company strategically important to Toyota Motor. At the same time, cash flow-related measures for Toyota Tsusho are weak for the current ratings, and we view this as a constraint on the ratings.	-1.164200825

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is looking at ways to expand its sport utility vehicle portfolio as SUVs grow to 40 percent of the U.S. light vehicle market by 2020 from about a third today, global sales chief Stephen Odell told Reuters.“As a segment gets that big, it’s probably going to fragment into different requirements,�� Odell said in an interview ahead of the unveiling on Tuesday in Los Angeles of the 2017 Ford Escape, a re-styled version of the company’s best-selling SUV model in the United States.Ford sells a smaller sport utility vehicle called the EcoSport in Europe and Latin America and has studied it for the U.S. market, Odell said. “It could at some point become a substantial part of the industry,�� he said.Separately, United Auto Workers union officials and analysts have said they expect Ford to use a factory in Wayne, Michigan to build a new SUV and a new pickup truck after production of the Ford Focus compact car is moved to Mexico in 2018.Sales of the current Escape in the United States should beat last year’s record of 306,212 vehicles, Odell said. But Escape sales are rising at a slower pace than several competitors, up just 1 percent for the year to date compared with 15 percent for Toyota Motor Corp’s RAV4 and 41 percent for Nissan Motor Co ��s Rogue.The intense competition Ford faces is reflected in decisions the company made as it revised the 2017 Escape, which goes on sale next year.Ford redesigned the exterior and interior of the 2017 Escape. But it won’t offer collision avoiding automatic emergency braking systems on the 2017 Escape, Odell said. Toyota said it will offer such collision avoiding systems as optional equipment for $300 to $500 on many 2017 models.“We think we’ve got more than enough safety technology on this product that’s relevant to the drivers that they would be prepared to pay for,�� Odell said. Vehicles in the Escape’s class have starting prices just under $24,000, and Japanese and European competitors currently have cheaper currencies to offset the cost of new features.Ford and several other automakers agreed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in September to make automatic emergency braking standard on future new vehicles for the U.S. market. But the automakers didn’t set a deadline. (Reporting By Joe White, additional reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Alan Crosby)	-0.4162997358

* Mexicans beat South Korea’s Ulsan 3-1* Egypt’s Al-Ahly face Corinthians in semi-finals (Adds second quarter-final, quotes)TOYOTA, Japan, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Argentine forward Cesar Delgado scored twice for Mexico’s Monterrey in a 3-1 win over South Koreans Ulsan Hyundai on Sunday to set up a Club World Cup semi-final against European champions Chelsea.African champions Al-Ahly beat Japan’s Sanfrecce Hiroshima 2-1 in blizzard-like conditions in the second quarter-final and will face Brazil’s Corinthians in the last four.Slick-passing Monterrey dominated Asian Champions League winners Ulsan in snow-sprinkled Toyota and showed to enough to suggest they will be no pushovers for Chelsea.“If we can play like we did today against Chelsea we will have a chance,�� Monterrey coach Victor Vucetich told reporters.Jesus Corona opened the scoring after nine minutes, finishing a superb three-man move from close range before his back-heel fell for Delgado to tap home in the 77th minute.Delgado smashed in his second seven minutes later to kill off the game, in which Hawk-Eye’s goal-line technology was being used for the first time, although Ulsan grabbed a late consolation through Lee Keun-ho.Ahly’s talismanic striker Mohamed Aboutrika, now in the twilight of his career, drilled home the winner 12 minutes into the second half to send the Egyptians through.They play Brazil’s Corinthians, holders of the Libertadores Cup, in the tournament’s first semi-final on Wednesday.“It was a very tough match,�� said Al-Ahly coach Hossam El Badry said. “Hiroshima were very organised but we had done our homework and I think we deserved to win.”Chelsea, under pressure to lift the trophy in Japan after becoming the first holders to exit the Champions League at the group stage, face Monterrey in Yokohama a day later.Elsayed Hamdi put the Egyptians ahead in the 15th minute, only for Hisato Sato to equalise with a fierce right-foot drive with snow falling heavily in Toyota.J-League champions Hiroshima lost goalkeeper Shusaku Nishikawa after three minutes, stretchered off with blood stains on his jersey after catching a knee in the face.Ahly captain Hossam Ghaly was then carried off with a knee injury with conditions rapidly deteriorating to be replaced by Aboutrika, famous in his home country for scoring the goal that won Egypt the 2008 African Cup of Nations.

"MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The last Australian-made six-cylinder Ford F.N Falcon rolled off an assembly line on Friday, marking the end of Ford's 91-year history of car-making in a country that simultaneously fell out of love with big cars and manufacturing.The end of operations - to be mirrored by GM Holden GM.N and Toyota 7203.T Australia next year - coincides with a move by the famed car company to close in Japan and Indonesia, where it sees ""no reasonable path to profitability"".The impending death of car manufacturing in Australia has sparked heated debate over the future of the economy and the role of government in propping up ailing sectors, after the governing center-right coalition cut subsidies to the sector.Dave Smith, national vehicle division secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, said the Ford workers “handled themselves with magnificent dignity�� on their last day.“It’s a shame for Australia because I think we lose so much when we no longer have vehicle manufacturing. But, you know, that’s part of history now,�� Smith told journalists at the Ford factory in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows.About 600 Ford workers are losing their jobs on Friday, all in the state of Victoria, where Ford’s Australian operations are headquartered. Separately, 160 Ford manufacturing employees are being redeployed to design and engineering roles with the company.Ford Australia chief executive Graeme Whickman said while it was a difficult day, it was an honor to see the last Falcon XR6 produced. He said the last manufactured cars would be put on show rather than sold privately.The decline of Australia’s manufacturing industry - employment in the sector out of total employment dropped from 13.4 percent in 2005 to 7.8 percent last year - has not been helped by changing tastes as motorists turn against the locally made, big passenger cars Ford and Holden are traditionally known for, for overseas-made small cars and sports utilities.Car manufacturers started making decisions to close down Australian operations in 2013 when the Australian dollar was above parity against the U.S. dollar, making local manufacturing uncompetitive.Retired Ford dealer Martin van Koldenhoven, from rural Western Australia, told Reuters the car-maker dominated sales in the 1980s with its sedans and “utes��, or utility vehicles, but then fell behind when buying trends changed.“Be it light commercial or four-wheel-drives or small cars, they seemed to be a step behind,�� van Koldenhoven said.“The market shifted and Ford didn’t shift fast enough.

Tokyo (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Aircraft said on Friday it will delay the maiden test flight of Japan’s first commercial jet in half a century by at least two weeks to fix a faulty pedal in the test plane’s cockpit.Already three years late, Mitsubishi Aircraft, which earlier this year pushed back the first test flight from June, is under pressure to get the aircraft ready for deliveries slated to start in June 2017 to Japan’s biggest carrier ANA Holdings.The rescheduled test flight will occur sometime during the second week of November, Mitsubishi Aircraft said in a press release.The Mitsubishi Heavy Industries subsidiary, in which Toyota Motor Corp is an investor, is building the $47-million regional jet with just under 100 seats in a bid to supplant Canada’s Bombardier Inc as the world’s second biggest maker of smaller passenger jetliners, behind Brazil’s Embraer SA.So far the jet, called the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), has secured 223 firm orders from airline operators including ANA, and the most recent for 32 planes in January from Japan Airlines. The biggest order, for 100 aircraft, with a further 100 options is from Trans State Holdings, a closely-held company that operates three regional U.S. airlines.	-1.76334477
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, the world's biggest automaker, will spend $1 billion to build a car factory in Mexico and plans to announce the investment on Wednesday, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.The 200,000-cars-a-year factory in the central state of Guanajuato will create about 2,400 direct jobs, one of the people told Reuters, declining to be identified because the plan was not yet public.Reuters reported earlier that the factory �� Toyota’s first to build passenger cars in Mexico - would produce the Corolla compact car from the summer of 2019, ending a self-imposed three-year freeze on new investments.President Enrique Pena Nieto will attend the announcement in Mexico on Wednesday, the people said.A Toyota spokeswoman in Tokyo said nothing had been decided.Toyota President Akio Toyoda had declared a pause on expansion to ensure growth did not come at the expense of quality, after the automaker was burned by a recall crisis in 2010.Toyota is vying with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and General Motors Co GM.N to claim the title of top-selling global automaker, with each selling about 10 million vehicles a year.Sources have said Toyota also plans to announce a new car factory in Guangzhou, China, this week.The planned factories in Guanajuato and Guangzhou will add up to 300,000 cars a year to Toyota’s annual production capacity, though not for a few years.The Guanajuato factory would serve as a benchmark for other plants in the region to improve efficiency, boost productivity, and reduce costs, one of the sources said.Under a new framework dubbed Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), Toyota is overhauling the way it develops and builds cars, and has said it would reduce new factory investments by about 40 percent compared with pre-financial crisis levels by making production lines simpler and leaner.	-0.5120438483
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp is in talks to invest $1 billion or more into Uber Technologies Inc’s self-driving vehicle unit, which would value the unit at $5 billion to $10 billion, said two people familiar with the talks.The investment would provide a cash injection for Uber’s self-driving program that is costing the money-losing startup hundreds of millions of dollars without generating revenue.It could also help underscore Uber’s value as the ride-hailing firm prepares for a stock market debut in which its value could top $100 billion.Uber and SoftBank declined to comment. A Toyota spokesman said the automaker “constantly reviews and considers various options for investment�� but does not have anything to announce.News of investment talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said a deal could be reached next month. SoftBank Group shares rose 4 percent in morning Tokyo trade whereas Toyota’s stock was flat.Japan’s largest automaker Toyota injected $500 million into Uber last year to work on self-driving cars, where both companies are seen as lagging rivals like Alphabet Inc’s self-driving unit Waymo.Uber, which last year lost about $3.3 billion, is betting on a transition to self-driving cars to eliminate the need to pay drivers.The nascent technology came under greater scrutiny last year after one of Uber’s self-driving cars struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year. Prosecutors last week declined to pursue criminal charges.The challenge of developing the technology is leading to previously unlikely alliances, with SoftBank and Toyota partnering up in Japan. SoftBank has invested $2.25 billion in General Motors Co’s self-driving unit Cruise, which has also received funds from Honda Motor Co Ltd.For a graphic on ties between automakers, ride-hailing firms and technology companies, click here tmsnrt.rs/2TOUqV9.	3.62786746

Kyle Busch was fourth, Paul Menard fifth, with Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano, Ryan Blaney, Chase Elliott and Jamie McMurray rounding out the top 10. Ford Fusions took seven of the top eight spots, with only Kyle Busch breaking up the string in a Toyota Camry. Elliott and McMurray were in Chevrolet Camaros.The race was delayed from its scheduled 2 p.m. ET start by more than 2 1/2 hours because of persistent rain in the area.Kurt Busch broke into the lead when the green flag finally waved and kept it until the first caution came out for competition reasons on Lap 30 as NASCAR wanted to check tire wear and other variables as is custom after rain washes a track “green�� before a race.Kurt Busch came out in front after the first round of pit stops and adjustments and stayed there even after a Lap 40 restart after a caution came out for a Darrell Wallace Jr. spin.But Blaney got to Kurt Busch and passed him on Lap 47 and cruised into the lead. Blaney held on for the Stage 1 win after another restart, with Kyle Larson second in his Chevrolet Camaro, Bowyer third, Harvick fourth, Denny Hamlin fifth in a Toyota Camry, Keselowski sixth and Busch seventh as the Ford Fusions dominated, taking five of the first seven spots.When the cars lined up to start Stage 2 after multiple pit stop strategies came into play, Kasey Kahne started up front, but Daniel Suarez spun and brought out another caution on Lap 67.Harvick came out second after pit stops on Lap 87 after a Larson spin brought out a caution a spot behind Menard, who didn’t pit.

TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks tumbled to a seven-week low on Tuesday as the yen’s rising strength against the dollar cast a shadow over corporate earnings that have come to rely on yen weakness to supercharge export revenue.The Nikkei share average tumbled 2.4 percent to 15,732.82, its lowest close since Feb. 12.The U.S. dollar lost 0.5 percent against the yen during Asia trade on Tuesday, putting downward pressure on the share prices of Japanese exporters.Shares of Toyota Motor Corp and Bridgestone Corp each ended the day 3.3 percent lower, while Nissan Motor Co Ltd fell 3.1 percent.The Topix subindex for iron and steel shares ended 3.1 percent lower after Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry forecast a year-on-year decline in crude steel output for the April-June quarter.The broader Topix shed 2.6 percent to end the day at 1,268.37 with each of its 33 subindexes in negative territory.The JPX-Nikkei Index 400 fell 2.6 percent to 11,440.39.

BERLIN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Volkswagen has promised to continue to set sensible sales targets for its car dealers in China to ensure a financially healthy distribution network in a slowing market.The German group said on Monday it would continue to pursue a “mutually beneficial and sustainable partnership�� with Chinese dealers based on an agreement the carmaker has reached with distributors in the world’s No. 1 auto market.“Satisfied dealers create satisfied customers,�� a spokeswoman for VW’s China operations said by email. “Through close cooperation and constant exchange with our dealerships in China, we constantly develop the VW brand together with our sales partners.”Chinese auto dealers have complained to the government that inflexible targets set during a market boom obliged them to buy too much stock and bear the brunt of a drop in demand. Growth of China’s auto market halved to 6.9 percent in 2014.Earlier this month, China’s dealers�� association said it had persuaded Germany’s BMW to pay 5.1 billion yuan ($815.54 million) in subsidies to dealers, while VW’s Porsche and Toyota Motor Corp are also negotiating with their Chinese dealers over subsidies and sales targets.	4.347826087
* Hits one-month low, records biggest fall in 3 months* Shipper, airliners hit most; yen gain hurts exporters* Oil companies gain on higher crude pricesTOKYO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell to a one-month low on Monday as selloff gripped the market on the first trading day of 2020 on fears of an escalation in U.S-Iran tensions.U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened a “major retaliation�� against Iran if Tehran were to hit back for the killing of one of its top military commanders.The Nikkei share average fell 1.91% to 23,204.86, breaking below two-major support levels - 25-day moving average around 23,600 and 50-day average around 23,350 - to its lowest level since Dec. 4.The broader Topix lost 1.39% to 1,697.49, its lowest close since late November. The Tokyo stock market was closed from Tuesday to Friday last week for New Year holidays.Both the Nikkei and Topix marked their biggest fall in three months, with 1,835 out of 2,161 listed stocks on the main board in the red, the highest ratio in three months.“The market will have to go through some correction. It was a bit overvalued to begin with, but the problems in the Middle East are the main drag now,�� said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities.Concerns about a further escalation in the Middle East tension hit shippers and airlines, which fell 3.5% and 2.8%, respectively.Two Nikkei heavyweights, SoftBank and Fast Retailing, also posted fairly large fall of 3.9% and 3%.As the yen gained on safe-haven buying, a wide range of exporter shares took a hit. Honda Motor fell 3.0%, while Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.9%.Meanwhile, a spike in oil prices helped oil companies, with the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s oil and coal producer index rising 2.9%. Inpex rose 4.1% while JXTG gained 3.4%.Nissan Motor fell 1.7%, in line with the overall market, to an eight-year low. Its former chairman Carlos Ghosn fled Japan while on bail during Japan’s market holidays.Ghosn faced four charges - which he has denied - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan had sacked him as chairman saying internal investigations revealed misconduct including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.

LOS ANGELES, April 20 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has won the tentative dismissal of some claims in the class-action lawsuit brought by owners of its vehicles over problems with sudden acceleration.In what would be a victory for Toyota if the ruling becomes definitive, U.S. District Judge James Selna in Santa Ana, California, said New York and Florida class representatives cannot bring claims under their states�� laws for lost value in their vehicles due to Toyota’s recalls for sudden, unintended acceleration.Toyota, which had filed a motion to dismiss the claims, said it does not comment on tentative rulings.Selna is expected to rule definitively sometime after hearing oral arguments on Monday.“As set forth herein, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants Motion to Dismiss,�� said Selna in court documents filed on Friday.The case consolidates class actions across various states.Selna in December dismissed a U.S. lawsuit brought by owners in 14 other countries who said their Toyotas lost value because of the sudden acceleration problems.Last June, Selna ruled that Toyota owners outside California who seek to recover losses from their vehicles�� value cannot pursue their claims under California law. California consumer protection laws are more favorable for plaintiffs than those of most other states.Toyota has recalled several million vehicles for problems since late 2009, that owners have linked to unintended acceleration.The recalls led to hundreds of state and federal lawsuits, including claims over alleged injuries and deaths and “economic loss�� claims tied to lost resale value.Selna handles most of the federal cases.The case is in re:Toyota Motor Corp Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 10-ml-2151.	-3.436988543
(Adds comment from PSA)PARIS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - PSA Group and Toyota have decided to end joint production of small cars by 2021 but will add cooperation in light commercial vehicles, French newspaper Les Echos reported on Thursday.Toyota will acquire PSA’s stake in the joint venture created by the two carmakers and will integrate the Czech plant of Kolin into its industrial apparatus, the newspaper wrote without citing sources.The two groups will expand cooperation in the production of light commercial vehicles in France and Spain, Les Echos added.PSA would go on assembling commercial vehicles for Toyota at its Sevelnord plant in northern France, while the group’s Spanish factory in Vigo would produce new Toyota vehicles.“Regarding Kolin, the initial agreement of the joint venture which was signed in January 2002 includes a close which enables each partner to review its position at a given moment.

MANILA, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Philippines plans to set aside around $600 million to help fund projects and incentives for its shrinking auto industry as part of a development programme now under review with the office of President Benigno Aquino, a senior government official said on Tuesday.The government and the local auto industry have been deliberating for more than two years on how best to expand the sector, including offering incentives, to make local manufacturers more competitive with others in Southeast Asia.“You are going to set aside a huge amount, a big amount of money, $600 mln for the programme...maybe more, maybe less,�� Rene Almendras, secretary to the cabinet, told reporters on the sidelines of an economic briefing in a description of the plans.“We want to make sure that the impact of the money we will put there will not just be one year, two years,�� he said.Automakers are hoping to capitalise on the government roadmap to boost local production, after sales hit record highs for several months this year on robust consumer spending. Vehicle ownership in the country remains the lowest among Southeast Asia’s five biggest economies at around just 35 per 1,000 people.Almendras said the government was still discussing how best to deploy the money to be allotted to the sector, but stressed that the roadmap will likely be finalised this year.“The gameplan is to create an industry that will generate jobs. To get there, you need to make sure that you have the right parameters,�� Almendras said, adding the roadmap now needs only some fine tuning.Some automakers, such as the local units of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Motors, are waiting for the roadmap before they finalise expansion plans in the country.“The passage of this roadmap is a big factor and crucial to the continued operation and future investment plans of Toyota in the Philippines,�� said Rommel Gutierrez, a spokesman for Toyota Philippines and president of auto industry group CAMPI.	4.029147021
* Japan firms fail to make significant European inroads* South Korea’s Hyundai, Kia boost sales, market share* Japan firms try to boost local production amid strong yenPARIS, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers, battered by a strong yen, are hunkering down in a stormy Europe, taking tentative steps to stand up to their aggressive South Korean rivals, in a market they see as challenging but worth the effort.Western Europe sales of all Japanese carmakers declined in the eight months to August from a year ago, ranging from Toyota Motor Corp’s 0.9 percent dip to Mitsubishi Motors Corp’s 34.5 percent tumble.That compares with South Korean Hyundai Motor Co’s 9.3 percent rise and the 25.1 percent jump of its affiliate, Kia Motors Corp, as aggressive marketing of their stylish, affordable cars paid off, helped by a weak won and a free trade agreement between South Korea and the European Union.Hyundai’s market share grew to 3.2 percent in Western Europe through August from 1.8 percent in 2007, while Kia’s rose to 2.4 percent from 1.5 percent.“It’s a tough region for Japanese companies to do well, and also if we use cars from Japan, of course it’s very difficult in terms of export,�� Karl Schlicht, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Europe, told reporters on Wednesday, a day before the Paris auto show opened to the media.So why do Japanese carmakers bother?In fact, some don’t. Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd, part of the Toyota group, will stop selling new cars in Europe in January 2013, blaming the high costs needed to meet Europe’s tough environmental regulations and the strong yen.But for many automakers, Europe’s tough regulatory requirements are part of the answer.“This is where all global standards for cars are set. If we don’t fight here, we can’t fight anywhere else,�� Hiroshi Harunari, executive vice President of Mitsubishi, told Reuters this week. Many Japanese automakers welcome Europe’s tough emissions and technological standards because they feel they help them compete better in other parts of the world.Executives cited standards such as the European Union’s Euro 5 and Euro 6, which cap emissions allowed from various kinds of vehicles.The European market may be struggling as austerity measures, high unemployment and fears about the future keep customers away from showrooms, but it still represents a major chunk of global auto sales.The 27 EU member states accounted for 19 percent of worldwide motor vehicle registrations - or 15.1 million vehicles - in 2011, according to data published on the website of European industry association ACEA.At a tough time for the region, Japanese automakers can count themselves lucky their presence in Europe is limited, said Christopher Richter, a senior analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific markets based in Tokyo.“Their exposure to the region, compared to the state of the German makers or the American makers, is very small. And given the state of economy and the state of the vehicle market there, that’s not such a bad thing.”Despite their decades-long presence, most Japanese carmakers have failed to make significant inroads in the highly competitive market, which is dominated by Western brands such as Volkswagen, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault and Ford.The exception is Nissan Motor Co, which has an alliance with Renault, receiving diesel engines and manual transmissions popular in Europe from the French firm. It is the only major Japanese carmaker whose market share has grown in Western Europe in the last five years.It rose to 3.4 percent in 2012 from 2.0 percent in 2007.Nissan also produces about 80 percent of its products sold in Europe within the region, a higher rate than that of Toyota at around 67 percent and Honda at 60 percent.Japanese firms suffered as the yen soared to about 77 against the dollar from 120 to the dollar five years ago, making it more expensive to export from Japan. Supply chains were also disrupted by the 2011 Japanese earthquake and Thai floods.Honda Motor Co Ltd, whose market share in Western Europe shrank to 1.0 percent this year from 1.9 percent five years ago, has seen its European business lose money for three years in a row and is not optimistic about a quick recovery.Toyota, whose market share dropped to 4.2 percent from 5.8 percent in 2007, brought its European business back to profit two years ago thanks to its financial services business.Mazda Motor Corp CEO Takashi Yamanouchi told reporters on Thursday the automaker wants to boost sales of cars in Europe from the current 185,000 vehicles to 300,000 within several years.In common with its peers, one of its strategies to help European operations is reducing reliance on imports. Toyota is investing $350 million to build the new Auris compact hatchback in Britain and the Corolla in Turkey.“It’s very easy to lose money here in Europe. So we have to be careful, and we want to go step by step,�� said Toyota’s Schlicht. “There is no bravado or nobody is saying we need to do crazy things in Europe.”Toyota aims to start making money this year in European car manufacturing.Nissan is investing 900 million pounds ($1.45 billion) in projects at its Sunderland plant in Britain, including production of the Qashqai crossover, Note compact car, and the LEAF electric vehicle.Meanwhile, Mitsubishi agreed to sell a plant in the Netherlands for 1 euro to a local bus maker on condition that employees did not lose their jobs, giving up a sluggish operation that had troubled it for years.The carmaker will start selling the Outlander SUV and the Mirage compact car in Europe soon.“We are currently on the defensive, but as we introduce new products into the market, we will also be on the offensive,�� said Mitsubishi’s Harunari. “We shouldn’t be pessimistic.��	-1.324672016
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N announced plans on Thursday to shore up its finances amid the coronavirus pandemic, aiming to generate more cash by resuming production next month of its most profitable vehicles while saving money through further cost cuts.To generate cash, the No. 2 U.S. automaker was poised to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back such profitable vehicles as its top-selling F-150 full-sized pickup, the Transit commercial van and SUVs.To conserve cash, Ford announced belt-tightening moves, including temporarily cutting top executives�� salaries. This came a day after Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded the Dearborn, Michigan-based company’s debt to “junk�� status and warned more downgrades could be necessary.“The actions we’re taking now are wide-ranging and substantial,�� Chief Executive Jim Hackett told employees in an email early on Thursday. “We hope they will be enough to give Ford the financial flexibility to ride out the economic and business effects of the coronavirus.”The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 21,000 people globally, has forced the shutdown of auto plants around the world.The outbreak has put pressure on companies, including Ford, which previously drew down credit lines to build its cash position and suspended its dividend.The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a $2 trillion economic rescue package to help unemployed workers and companies, including the auto industry, hit hard by the outbreak.U.S. President Donald Trump, concerned about the economic repercussions of an extended shutdown, has said he wants America to get back to business by Easter, or April 12.To get more cash coming in, Ford said Thursday it would restart key plants, while introducing additional safety measures to protect returning workers from the coronavirus. It said it would detail the additional measures later.Ford also took additional moves to conserve cash, announcing its top 300 executives would defer 20% to 50% of salaries for at least five months starting May 1, with the executive chairman deferring his entire salary. Hackett will defer half his salary.Hackett said Ford’s goal was to avoid layoffs during the crisis, but warned that could change if the impact of the outbreak is more severe than anticipated.Other actions Ford is taking to conserve cash include deferring salary increases more broadly, suspending overtime for salaried employees and freezing hiring in non-critical areas, Hackett said.However, Ford employees will continue to get healthcare coverage and those exposed to the virus and placed in quarantine will get paid time off, he added.General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA)FCHA.MIFCAU.N previously said they would shut their North American operations through March 30 and then reassess after that.FCA on Thursday extended its shutdown through April 13, while its parts distribution centers will continue to operate with paid volunteers. Mexico’s status is subject to a separate announcement.GM on Thursday extended its shutdown indefinitely with no firm restart dates, but said it would evaluate the situation on a week-to-week basis.The automaker said near-term programs like its redesigned full-size SUVs, electric vehicles such as the Cruise Origin, and new Ultium battery “will continue as planned.�� But it will adjust timing and milestones of other future programs “as necessary�� to conserve cash, it added.United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble said Thursday the union viewed announcements like Ford’s with concern, and any decision to restart production should be based on data and each state’s position with regards to the coronavirus outbreak.“The only guideline in a boardroom should be management asking themselves, ‘Would I send my family - my own son or daughter - into that plant and be 100% certain they are safe?’� he said in a statement.The UAW has said three union members who worked at FCA plants have died due to the coronavirus.Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an order on Monday barring non-essential businesses from operating until April 13.Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T said on Thursday it would resume work at its U.S. and Canadian plants on April 7.Meanwhile, Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it would extend a shutdown of its North American plants for two weeks, through April 17.Ford plans to begin production on one shift at its Hermosillo, Mexico, assembly plant, where it builds the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans.It will restart production on April 14 at its Dearborn plant that builds the F-150 and a Kentucky plant that makes the Super Duty version of the pickup as well as the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. Other assembly and parts plants will restart then as well.Ford shares closed down 2.4%, while GM rose 4.8%.	-2.389185791
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto sales rose nearly 4 percent in February, delivering a better-than-expected performance as strength in the housing market tempered worries over the wave of federal spending cuts due to begin on Friday.The annual auto sales pace for February was 15.38 million vehicles, according to Autodata, better than the 15.1 million rate expected by economists polled by Thomson Reuters.This marked the fourth month in a row that the sales pace held above the 15 million-vehicle mark, a sign that rising home values are helping American consumers feel more confident about buying a new vehicle.""The escalator is heading up and not down,"" said Kurt McNeil, head of U.S. sales operations for General Motors Co GM.N, which posted a better-than-expected sales gain.This boost in housing comes at a time when the average vehicle on the road is at an all-time high of more than 11 years old and pushing past the point of repair.Increased housing construction helped boost sales of pickup trucks during the month. GM’s truck sales to small business owners were up 40 percent, giving a “strong vote of confidence in the underlying economy,�� McNeil said.GM, the largest U.S. automaker, posted a nearly 30 percent jump in sales of its Chevrolet Silverado trucks, while Ford Motor Co's F.N F-Series gained 15.3 percent.Improvements in the housing market and pent-up demand for new vehicles offset the risks posed to the broader economy by the across-the-board “sequestration�� U.S. budget cuts, Ford and GM executives said during conference calls on Friday.U.S. consumers are showing “nerves of steel�� in the face of the budget cuts, Ford Chief Economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick said, adding that the cuts would lop off about a half a percentage point from GDP growth if fully realized.Auto sales each month are an early indicator of economic health. The auto industry is in the midst of its fourth year of recovery from an economic downturn that pushed GM and its smaller U.S. rival, Chrysler Group LLC, into bankruptcy in 2009.GM’s U.S. sales rose 7 percent in February to 224,314 cars and trucks, while Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, saw sales rise 9 percent to a weaker-than-expected 195,822 vehicles.U.S. auto sales in 2012 rose more than 13 percent to 14.5 million cars and trucks. Sales rose 14 percent in January to an annual sales rate of 15.3 million.Like January, February is typically a slow sales month for the industry, so a small change in sales can have a large impact on the annual rate for the month.Sales at Chrysler, majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA FIA.MI, rose 4 percent to 139,015 vehicles, slightly less than some analysts expected.Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T each posted weaker-than-expected sales last month. Toyota's sales rose 4.3 percent, while Honda fell 2 percent and Nissan dropped 6.6 percent.GM shares closed 6 cents higher at $27.21 and Ford shares were unchanged at $12.61 on Friday."	-1.190941039
* Toyota, other top firms to offer 3 pct pay raises* Overall increases 1 pct, less than sales tax hike* Solid wage gains needed for economy to escape deflationTOKYO, March 12 (Reuters) - Big Japanese companies such as Toyota Motor Corp will offer the most generous pay raises in years on Wednesday, but workers will still struggle to offset a sales tax increase, highlighting the difficulties the government is facing in overcoming entrenched deflation.Toyota, Hitachi Ltd and Panasonic Corp will be among the firms announcing their responses to union pay demands after a year of soaring profits thanks to the weak yen and massive stimulus policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.But this first batch of companies in Japan’s annual “spring labour offensive�� represent the bluest of the blue chips; the vast majority of Japanese employees work for smaller companies that haven’t benefited as much from “Abenomics.”�It’s impossible for wage hikes to totally offset the impact of the sales tax hike,�� said Hisashi Yamada, chief economist at the Japan Research Institute. “It’s hard to think wage hikes would spread among small firms as much as big firms.”Government spending and the Bank of Japan’s enormous asset purchases have made a start in dragging the world’s third-biggest economy out of 15 years of deflation and uncertain growth, but a durable recovery needs a cycle of rising profits, wages and prices.Abe’s government has been publicly pressuring companies to do their part and raise wages. Economy Minister Akira Amari on Tuesday appear to threaten government action against firms that don’t comply.“Companies that don’t make any response, despite having higher profits, despite the government front-loading corporate tax cuts and transferring capital to them, are being uncooperative in contributing to a positive economic cycle,�� Amari said.“The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will take some kind of response.”Toyota will offer total compensation - base pay, seniority increases and bonuses - worth 7.6 percent more than last year, said a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations. This represents a comfortable lift for employees at the world’s biggest carmarker. Excluding the bonus, it would mark the company’s biggest pay raise in 21 years.For major firms generally, though, total increases are likely to be around 3 percent, analysts say, just enough to cover the sales tax hike going into effect in April but not to offset the modest inflation the BOJ is trying to generate.For the thousands of companies below the top tier - which employ the vast majority of Japanese workers - compensation is likely to be less generous.For example, when big car makers such as Toyota raise base pay for their workers, they can squeeze suppliers to cut costs, putting downward pressure on their wages and diluting the economic lift of the wage gains at the top.Including smaller firms - which have seen import costs rise due to the weak yen and which employ many part-timers and other irregular workers - Japanese workers overall may see their pay packets grow just 1 percent or so, analysts said.“Purchasing power may at best break even for those at major firms,�� said economist Naoki Iizuka at Citigroup Global Markets Japan.“A virtuous economic cycle needed for Abenomics goal of sustaining growth is not working at Japan Inc, and it is hard to imagine this year’s wage talks will lead to such move.”Because bonuses rise and fall with the economy, a sustainable recovery will require solid gains in base pay so that people feel secure enough to increase spending, economists say.Toyota will offer to raise base pay by 2,700 yen ($26.15) a month, or 0.8 percent, the first rise in this key compensation component in six years, the source said. But that is well below the 4,000 yen sought by workers.Many Japanese firms remain wary of raising base pay due to doubts about over the recovery’s sustainability and concern about higher fixed personnel costs, which are hard to shed during downturns.Rengo, Japan’s top labour federation, is calling this year for higher base pay for the first time in five years, citing the economic recovery. Japan’s most influential business lobby, Keidanren, has also given a nod to raising base pay for the first time in six years.Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, NEC Corp, Panasonic and Fujitsu will all offer 1,000-2,000 yen raises in monthly base pay, versus union demands of 4,000 yen from the electronics companies.

June 17 (Reuters) - The Malaysia unit of Japan’s biggest automaker Toyota Motor Corp. plans to setup a 2.5 billion ringgit ($667 million) programme to raise funds via both conventional and Islamic bonds, a regulatory filing showed.The proposed programme from Toyota Capital Malaysia Sdn Bhd was rated AAA by RAM Ratings, and follows a 1 billion ringgit sukuk programme setup in 2008 that matured earlier this month.The Malaysia unit has two other conventional debt programmes that can raise a combined 1.8 billion ringgit; It sold a debut sukuk in 2008.The move comes at a time when Japanese firms are renewing efforts in the sector, with Japan’s financial regulator relaxing rules for domestic banks to use Islamic financial products.Over the past year, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan’s largest lender, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp have expanded their Islamic finance activities overseas.

"(Reuters) - U.S. supermarket operator Kroger Co KR.N said it will start testing driverless grocery delivery on Thursday with technology partner Nuro at a single Fry's Food Store in Scottsdale, Arizona.Kroger and rival Walmart Inc WMT.N each have teamed up with autonomous vehicle companies in a bid to lower the high-cost of ""last-mile"" deliveries to customer doorsteps, as online retailer Amazon.com AMZN.O rolls out free Whole Foods delivery for subscribers to its Prime perks program.“Kroger wants to bring more customers the convenience of affordable grocery delivery,�� said Kroger Chief Digital Officer Yael Cosset, who added that the test will also gauge consumer demand for the service.The first phase of the test will use a fleet of Toyota Prius cars equipped with Nuro technology. Those cars have seats for humans who can override autonomous systems in the event of an error or emergency. Nuro’s R1 driverless delivery van, which has no seats, will begin testing this autumn, the companies said.“While we compete final certification and testing of the R1, the Prius will be delivering groceries and helping us improve the overall service,�� a Nuro spokeswoman said.Self-driving car delivery from the Fry’s store will cost $5.95 with no minimum order. It is only available at addresses within the store’s zip code of 85257, Kroger said.Walmart and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O self-driving car company Waymo are partnering to test a service that shuttles Phoenix shoppers to stores to collect online grocery orders."	-0.6489292667
(Adds Toyota comment in paragraphs 4 and 5)TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s head of public relations, an American and its first female senior executive, was arrested on Thursday on a suspected violation of Japan’s drug laws for sending a painkiller through the mail.Julie Hamp, an American appointed in April as the carmaker’s chief communications officer, its first female managing officer, was arrested after the painkiller Oxycodone was mailed from the United States to Tokyo’s Narita Airport, Tokyo police said.Hamp said she did not think she had imported an illegal substance, a spokesman for Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police Department said, while Toyota stood by the Tokyo-based executive.“Toyota has been made aware of Ms. Hamp’s arrest but has no further facts in light of the ongoing investigation by the authorities,�� Toyota spokesman Shino Yamada said in an emailed statement.“We will continue to cooperate fully with the investigation. We are confident, however, that once the investigation is complete, it will be revealed that there was no intention on Ms. Hamp’s part to violate any law.”Oxycodone, an addictive painkiller, is a prescription drug in the United States. In Japan, the police said, only specially designated parties were allowed to import the drug.Hamp’s promotion in April, along with the appointment of Toyota Europe chief Didier Leroy as executive vice president and African-American Christopher Reynolds as a managing officer, marked the acceleration of a diversification drive for a management team long dominated by Japanese men.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called on corporate Japan to appoint women to 30 percent of top jobs by 2020. Women account for only 11 percent of mid- to senior-level management jobs in Japan and 1 percent of executive committee members, according to researcher McKinsey.	1.134159081

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s tax chief is preparing to press criminal charges against some of the biggest companies operating in the country as part of an enforcement crusade, telling Reuters that officials had opened “four or five�� cases of tax fraud this year alone.The campaign has already squeezed hundreds of millions of dollars from retailer Walmart Inc's Mexico unit WALMEX.MX and Coca-Cola bottler Femsa FMSAUBD.MX, with other firms under scrutiny in the country with the lowest take in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Raquel Buenrostro, chief of the Tax Administration Service (SAT), said past administrations were too lenient with powerful firms, depriving the government of needed income.“There was tax fraud in the past, and it never led to criminal procedures,�� Buenrostro said on Monday in an interview at her spartan office, decorated with a Mexican flag and a framed photo of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.“Executives now know that if they commit tax fraud, we will have to open a criminal procedure,�� Buenrostro said.She declined to reveal which companies were facing criminal charges, but said the biggest debtors were in industries including steel, food, autos, pharmaceuticals, finance, mining, retail and energy.Lopez Obrador tapped Buenrostro as tax chief in January, after she earned a reputation as a trusted aide - along with the nickname ‘Iron Lady�� - during a clampdown on federal procurement that cut spending by $9 billion in a year.The president, a leftist, runs a tight budget and has promised no new taxes for three years. Instead he wants to increase revenue through more efficient collection and has threatened to expose 15 companies he says owe a total of $2 billion.On Tuesday he said Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T was bringing its payments up to date, but that some Canadian mining companies were seeking international arbitration rather than pay what the government said they owed. It was not clear if they were on the president's list of 15 companies behind on taxes. Toyota did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Buenrostro said the list of 15 represented just a handful of the companies in arrears.When asked how many criminal complaints had been opened against large companies, Buenrostro said: “From big taxpayers we have four or five... for tax fraud, this year, plus others that have accumulated.”She did not say how many overall companies were targeted in the new complaints.Walmart de Mexico paid $358 million to the SAT last month after negotiations over matters including the 2014 sale of a restaurant chain. The company said the amount was arrived at in collaboration with the SAT.Walmart de Mexico’s corporate affairs director previously said the retailer did not have knowledge of a criminal complaint. The company declined to comment in response to questions from Reuters on Tuesday.Mexican conglomerate Femsa, one of the world’s largest Coca-Cola bottlers, followed days later with its own agreement with the SAT, pledging to pay $398 million. The company said the payment resolved interpretative differences over taxes paid outside Mexico.Femsa was not presented with a criminal charge, a corporate communications representative said.Buenrostro said she welcomed reaching a deal with companies without resorting to charges.“Our aim is not to send people to jail,�� she said.Buenrostro declined to say whether Walmart and Femsa were threatened with, or faced, criminal charges.The strategy appears to be yielding results. Large taxpayers forked over more than 50 billion pesos ($2.3 billion) in total from January to May, compared with only 37 billion pesos during all of last year.Buenrostro also said the SAT, with 1,300 audits underway, has focused on cases where it was confident of proving a tax obligation, rather than entering the complicated world of tax law interpretation.The SAT is reviewing recent transactions, typically from within the past five to seven years, she said.“We selected not only the biggest debts, but also the easiest ones to recover,�� Buenrostro said.($1 = 21.8634 Mexican pesos)	-4.610335089
CONCORD, N.C. - Drivers who hoped to learn as much as they could about NASCAR’s new lower-horsepower, higher-drag competition package for Saturday night’s Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race were still guessing on Friday afternoon, after rain washed out all but a few minutes of practice at Charlotte Motor Speedway.As a result, drivers and crew chiefs have no certain idea what racing with the radically different package will look like when the elite of the Cup series compete for the $1 million top prize on the 1.5-mile intermediate speedway.With restrictor plates on the engines and super-sized spoilers on the rear of the Cup cars, Kurt Busch expects to see pack racing a la Talladega.“I’m anticipating it,�� said Busch, who ran a total of four laps in Friday’s practice, which was interrupted by one deluge and halted by a second. “I don’t know how active it will be with the draft, but the way we approached our car on the 41 was in the area that was slightly different than one of the other cars at Stewart-Haas, and another car went their route.“We’re trying to gather data as fast as we can and then be able to still zero in on what we believe will be the trend. I’m anticipating pack drafting. Here we are at a 1.5-mile race track with a restrictor plate, trying to create a drafting style package, because data shows that Talladega and Daytona are the two most appreciated races because of lead changes, position swaps and action on track.”Busch was second fastest at 169.502 mph in the abbreviated practice session. Teammate Kevin Harvick, winner of the last two Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series points races, posted the fastest lap at 170.406 mph. Ford drivers claimed five of the top six positions on the speed chart, the one exception being Denny Hamlin, whose No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota clocked in as third fastest (169.428 mph).Twelve races into the 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series schedule, and Kyle Busch has already won 25 percent of the points events in NASCAR’s premier series.Compared with the success Harvick has enjoyed, however, three victories aren’t quite good enough. Harvick claimed trophies in five of the first dozen races, including the last two, and the No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford shows no signs of slacking off.As a consequence, Busch is looking for still more speed in his No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota.“We’ve got to catch up a little bit on speed overall, I’d say,�� Busch acknowledged on Friday at Charlotte Motor Speedway, after running the better part of one lap in opening All-Star Race practice. “I think our Toyotas are close, but it seems the Blue Ovals (Fords) have got a little bit of an advantage this year. You kind of see it weekly. You look at the rundown on the pylon, and it’s lots of Fords lined up in the top-12 spots.“So it’s pretty obvious based just off of last year and looking at the pylon and kind of seeing a little bit more spread there between Chevys, Fords and Toyotas. All in all, we’ve just got to go to work and figure out what we got to do in order to get better. I think some of the aero changes that have kind of come down this year have benefited them a little bit more so than us, and we’re trying to work through some of those things as we go right here throughout the season.”JEFF GORDON TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE NASCAR HALL OF FAME NODIf there’s one name on the ballot considered a shoo-in for the next NASCAR Hall of Fame class, it belongs to four-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon, who occupies the third rung on the all-time victory list with 93.Gordon is taking nothing for granted with respect to the upcoming vote on Wednesday. In fact, he’s trying to keep the possibility of Hall of Fame election in the back of his mind.“On the one hand, I’m excited,�� Gordon said during a Friday press conference at Charlotte Motor Speedway to unveil the throwback rainbow paint scheme on the car William Byron will drive later this season at Darlington. “On the other hand, I’m too young to be in a Hall of Fame or have a throwback paint scheme.“I’m really just kind of waiting till next week and trying not to think too much about it. I’ve gone to the Hall of Fame for the inductions many times and seen some great speeches and legends of our sport. So whenever that day comes, it’s a huge honor.��--By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service. Special to Field Level Media.	-0.2198607549
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's TSLA.O high-end Model S sedan lost its ""recommended"" rating and the electric carmaker slid overall by six spots to almost the bottom in Consumer Reports magazine's annual reliability survey.Every domestic automaker landed in the bottom half of the magazine’s new-car reliability rankings, which include data collected for more than 500,000 vehicles. The survey, which ranked 29 brands in the U.S. market, was released on Wednesday.“It’s the complexities that have really dragged down Tesla,�� said Jake Fisher, the magazine’s director of auto testing. “The majority of the problems that we’re seeing with Tesla truly are mechanical issues.”The Model S appears similar to the model launched six years ago, but Tesla has made significant mechanical and software changes over the past few years, including making air suspension and all-wheel-drive standard, he said. That can hurt reliability as more complexity is added.Tesla said it had streamlined and simplified Model S configurations, not made them more complex. It also said the issues cited by owners in the Consumer Reports survey had previously been addressed by the carmaker, including with over-the-air software updates.“Not only are our cars the safest and best performing vehicles available today, but we take feedback from our customers very seriously and quickly implement improvements,�� the company said in a statement.Tesla said that was why the Model S has been top ranked on Consumer Reports�� owner satisfaction survey every year since 2013, when the carmaker was first included.Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus and Toyota brands took the top two spots in the survey, as they have for six consecutive years. The survey results can be found at CR.org/reliability.The magazine’s annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.Tesla's ranking slid to No. 27, ahead of only General Motors Co's GM.N Cadillac brand and Volvo. The Model S, which starts at $74,500, dropped to “Below Average�� from “Above Average�� last year, and its overall score denied it Consumer Reports�� “Recommended�� tag. Owners reported suspension problems and other issues, including problems with the extending door handle, the magazine said.Tesla’s Model X SUV remained “Much Worse Than Average�� with ongoing problems, including with the falcon-wing doors and center display screen. The Model 3 sedan, seen as key to Tesla’s profitability, debuted with “Average�� reliability.In May, Consumer Reports recommended the Model 3 after its latest tests showed a software update improved the car’s braking. It has maintained that rating.Tesla was scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday.Other domestic brand rankings included: Ford Motor Co's F.N Ford and Lincoln brands at No. 18 and 20; GM's Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands at No. 19, 23 and 25; and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MI Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and Ram brands at No. 21, 22, 24 and 26, respectively.Rounding out the survey's top five were Japan's Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, which registered the biggest gain, by nine spots; Subaru 7270.T and Hyundai Motor Co's 005380.KS Kia brand."	3.95165438
The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.Carmakers are on something of a roll as they convene in Detroit. In the years to come, however, technology could make the ride rougher.As the North American International Auto Show kicked off on Monday, shares of leading manufacturers were getting little, if any, credit for profit growth. BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen all fetch between eight and 10 times this year’s expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Daimler and Fiat Chrysler come in a bit higher.The rule of thumb is that anything lower than 10 times earnings suggests a degree of stagnancy. In fact, however, that’s often not the case. Toyota, for one, is seen growing its bottom line by 10 percent in each of the next three years.Recalls, currency fears and geopolitics are all to blame. The respective ignition and airbag fiascos at GM, Honda and Takata are a big factor. A weakening yen also has given Japanese companies a $3,000-a-vehicle pricing advantage in the United States over Detroit’s Big Three, according to Morgan Stanley. Problems in Russia and Latin America, a lackluster recovery in Europe and the prospect of slowing sales in China add to concerns.Bigger trends could further restrain valuations. The rise of connected cars and, eventually perhaps, driverless ones pose three big problems for industry titans.First, they’re not the obvious leaders for technological innovation. Incumbents are apt to yield in software, which may comprise a third of the $60 billion of connected car-related revenue by 2030, according to consultancy firm Roland Berger.Second, manufacturers have more to fear than just Tesla and Google. Ford, Fiat and others are required to improve fuel standards. European laws demand that CO2 emissions be slashed by a quarter to 95 grams a kilometer within seven years. Volkswagen reckons each gram of reduction costs it 100 million euros, or $118 million.Finally, carmakers are bound to be squeezed by the price of technology and the growing negotiating power of patent holders. Customers, for example, may be willing to pay up to $5,000 for assisted driving features, according to Boston Consulting Group, but the cost of producing them can be much higher. As far as automaker valuations go, tech may be driving them down a dead end.	4.279724705

* Toyota to drop diesel from new C-HR compact* Carmakers rewriting strategic plans post “dieselgate�� (Adds context)PARIS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Toyota has decided to drop diesel engines from its new C-HR compact in the wake of Volkswagen’s emissions scandal and will probably do the same for future model renewals, the carmaker’s second-ranking global executive said on Thursday.The Japanese automaker decided “within the last six to 12 months�� not to offer a diesel version of the car, unveiled at the Paris auto show, because demand for the powertrain technology is falling sharply, Executive Vice President Didier Leroy told Reuters in an interview.If faced with a renewal decision today for other models up to and including the larger Auris compact, a Toyota staple, “we would probably do the same thing��, Leroy added.Toyota’s decision is the latest example of how the so-called “dieselgate�� scandal is forcing carmakers to rewrite strategic plans that will shape their futures for years to come.Reuters reported this month that Renault expects diesel engines to disappear from most of its European cars after the French automaker reviewed the costs of meeting tighter emissions standards following Volkswagen’s scandal.While the scandal centred on the German carmaker’s cheat software, it also focused public attention on an industry-wide disparity between nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions on the road and those recorded in regulatory tests.Mass-market diesels that meet legal NOx limits in approval tests commonly emit at least five times as much in everyday use.Renault has said it complied strictly with regulations and that its cars were not equipped with emissions falsifying software.From 2019, vehicle approvals will depend on emissions performance during real driving. This is compelling manufacturers to install costlier emissions treatment systems. (Reporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by Richard Lough and Mark Potter)	-0.3446493193

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - After a less-than-stellar rollout of last year’s NASCAR Cup Series Camaros, Chevrolet teams are optimistic that changes to the car will result in improved performance in 2020.So far, the results seem to bear that out. Chevrolet driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. of JTG Daugherty Racing won the pole for Sunday’s Daytona 500 (2:30 p.m. ET on FOX, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Alex Bowman of Hendrick Motorsports grabbed the other locked-in position on the outside of the front row.In Thursday night’s second Bluegreen Vacations Duel 150-mile qualifying race, Hendrick’s William Byron visited Victory Lane for the first time in NASCAR’s top series, leading a 1-2-3 sweep by Chevrolets.“I feel like, last year, Chevy came -- they just missed the ball,�� said NASCAR Hall of Famer Richard Petty, who fields the No. 43 Camaros driven by Bubba Wallace. “This year, they corrected a lot of those mistakes. We hope that they corrected it enough that we’re going to be competitive wherever we go.“Right now, I think Chevrolet’s probably got the best overall program. ... I think they’re totally, totally committed to racing. We want to be right along in there with somebody that’s as dedicated to racing as we are.”Saturday’s Chevrolet owners press conference in the Daytona International Speedway media center covered a broad range of topics, with the following highlights:??Rick Hendrick expressed his commitment to making seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson’s final full-time season in the NASCAR Cup Series as successful as possible. “Jimmie is fired up,�� Hendrick said. “I think they’re going to have a really good year with the new car. ... I’ve never seen Jimmie so energized. We going to give him everything we’ve got, leave nothing on the table.��??The new Chevrolet engine block and headers are ready to go. “It’s done,�� said Jim Campbell, Chevrolet’s U.S. vice president for performance vehicles and motorsports. “It’s rotated when it’s ready. Typically, on the engine side, we do that when the pool of current engines is at the point where you can rotate them out.��??Chip Ganassi was predictably close-mouthed about the prospects of re-signing driver Kyle Larson, who is in the final year of his current contract. Larson has expressed interest in listening to offers from other owners. “I think it’s always important to keep good people around, whether it’s a driver, crew chief, engineer, whatever,�� said Ganassi, who didn’t elaborate. But as that question was asked, Hendrick reached for his wallet and eyed Ganassi with a knowing look.??Richard Childress is happy with his 2020 NASCAR Cup Series driver lineup, with two-time NASCAR Xfinity Series champion Tyler Reddick having moved up to the premier series.“We feel good about it,�� Childress said. “We moved Tyler up. He earned the right to move up. Excited about having him. He and Austin (Dillon) are going to make good teammates, work together so far as everything I’ve seen.”TOYOTA RELYING ON QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY IN NASCAR CUP SERIESOne only needs to take a quick mental inventory of the 19 race trophies and big shiny championship hardware that Joe Gibbs Racing organization earned in 2019 to see the realized potential of Toyota in the NASCAR Cup Series.It remains great motivation in 2020 for Toyota teams that represent a smaller group of drivers than the Cup Series�� other two car manufacturers but have certainly proven themselves up for the challenge.Quality over quantity has served Toyota well.Not only did Toyota have three drivers in the four-driver championship finale field, it won the manufacturer’s title before the last green flag of 2019 even flew.“I’ll start by saying that the hardest thing in pro sports is to stay up there because there’s so many obviously great teams, competitors and so for our team, like tomorrow (Daytona 500), we’ll be the smallest group out there and so we really need to work together,�� Gibbs said of Toyota’s efforts. “It’s a huge deal for us.“Last year was phenomenal. I have learned that for sure, in pro sports, when you start the next year, last year didn’t buy you anything and so we’re going to be going after it as hard as we can. It was a thrill last year, but we realize the challenge in front of us.”Not only is Gibbs�� driver Kyle Busch the reigning series champion, but teammate Denny Hamlin is the defending Daytona 500 winner -- giving Toyota plenty of good feelings heading into Sunday’s race and into the season. Their teammate, Martin Truex Jr., won the 2017 championship. And the fourth JGR teammate, Erik Jones, earned his first Cup victory at Daytona in the 2018 summer race and then won the exhibition Busch Clash race here last weekend.Leavine Family Racing has a new driver behind the wheel of its No. 95 Toyota -- highly-touted rookie Christopher Bell, who put up an impressive eight NASCAR Xfinity Series wins in 2019 -- he won 15 races in just the last two seasons. And the 2016 NASCAR Xfinity Series champion, Daniel Suarez, will drive a third Toyota team car, the No. 96 Gaunt Bros. Racing Toyota Camry -- although an accident in Thursday’s 150-mile Duel qualifying race eliminated him from this year’s Daytona 500 field.The three teams represent different levels of Toyota involvement -- from long-time success of Gibbs to Leavine, who has fielded Toyotas for three years now, and the newcomer, Gaunt.“We have gradually progressed and last year with Toyota and TRD and Coach Gibbs, we raised our level with Matt (DiBenedetto) driving the car (in 2019) and this year we feel like we’ve done it again,�� co-owner Bob Leavine said. “So, you know, expectations I don’t like to put out there, but yeah, we do have higher expectations and it’s enjoyable.”Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson will be competing in his final full-time NASCAR season in 2020, but the two-time Daytona 500 winner would not go so far as to declare Sunday’s Daytona 500 his absolute last.The popular champion said he’s not ready to give up racing altogether, and unlike some of his retired contemporaries, has no immediate plans to move into the television booth.“It could be down the road,�� Johnson said. “I feel like I still have things I want to do and accomplish behind the wheel. And when that fades, I would say maybe there’s a chance (to do TV). I haven’t pursued that or put much time or effort into it. I still have stuff I want to accomplish behind the wheel.”Johnson has mentioned numerous times that he will be open to all racing once he steps aside from this fulltime NASCAR duties--from off-road racing to IMSA sportscars to occasional NASCAR Cup Starts at certain venues. He did rule out the Indianapolis 500 but was open to an IndyCar road course event, perhaps.“It could be my last 500 (on Sunday), I don’t know,�� Johnson said. “I am officially retiring from 38 weekends a year at the end of the season. I do know that, but the right situation, I would certainly consider it. I know that I can’t shut off my competitive nature at the end of the year and call it good.”Johnson finished runner-up in his Duel 150 qualifying race on Thursday and will start Sunday’s Daytona 500 sixth in his No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro.Daytona International Speedway has made special plans to honor Johnson prior to Sunday’s green flag. There has been a kiosk in the infield throughout the weekend showing highlights of Johnson’s two Daytona 500 wins in 2006 and 2013.There will be a video tribute to Johnson prior to the race highlighting his championship career accomplishments and showing various tributes from other drivers. A long introduction will take place during the “driver intros�� portion of pre-race and Johnson will lead the field on one of the warm-up laps prior to the race start.--On Saturday morning, Daytona International Speedway announced the debut of SoccerFest on July 4 weekend in 2021. By process of elimination, that means the summer NASCAR Cup race won’t return to its traditional July 4 weekend position on the schedule. The Coke Zero 400 takes on additional prominence on this year’s schedule as the cutoff race for the Playoffs.--In cool. Overcast conditions, 26 of the 40 drivers set to compete in Sunday’s Daytona 500 participated in Saturday’s final practice session for the Great American Race. Ford drivers dominated the session, securing the top eight positions on the speed chart. Joey Logano, the 2015 Daytona 500 winner, posted the fastest lap at 200.516 mph, with 2007 winner Kevin Harvick close behind at 200.512 mph.--By Reid Spencer and Holly Cain.

CANTON, Mississippi (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co said it will add workers and start production of the Sentra compact sedan at its Canton plant in Mississippi later this year.Adding Sentra production along with two previously announced vehicles by the end of the year will mean 1,000 more jobs at the plant, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said at an event held at the Canton plant on Thursday.Nissan officials said 400 of those jobs have already been added to prepare for production of the Xterra mid-sized SUV and the mid-sized pickup truck Frontier, which is starting in November.Total employment at the Canton plant will rise to 4,500 by year’s end, Nissan officials said.The move comes amid efforts already under way by the United Auto Workers union to organize the existing 3,900 workers at the Nissan plant.The UAW, along with some Mississippi politicians and the head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), early this month announced an effort to organize the Canton Nissan workers.The Canton plant near the Mississippi state capital of Jackson is also the production site of Nissan’s best-selling Altima mid-sized sedan.The Sentra will be the second all-new model to hit U.S. dealerships in the next 15 months, Nissan said. Sales began a few weeks ago for the 2013 Altima, the first of those five new vehicles.By the year’s end, seven different vehicles will be made at the Canton plant, which Bryant said was a “remarkable�� accomplishment.Bill Krueger, vice chairman of Nissan Americas, said that in 2011, 69 percent of the Nissans sold in the United States were made in North America, and that by 2015, that figure will rise to 85 percent.Prior to the announcement on Thursday of the addition of Sentra production, Nissan had invested $2.06 billion at the plant, which opened in 2003. Krueger said Nissan will spend more than $20 million on capital improvements at the plant to add the new production.Production at Canton by next year will be 450,000 vehicles annually, up from the current capacity of 400,000, Krueger said.Last year, when Toyota Motor Corp opened a new plant near Tupelo in northern Mississippi, Bryant, then governor-elect, said he would resist UAW efforts to organize auto workers. He took the same stance on Thursday in Canton, but said that he will not spend state money to do so. Rather, he will support professional organizations that resist the union.“I don’t believe, personally, that we’d see this growth in the automobile industry to include Toyota and Nissan and the many suppliers if we had union growth in the state of Mississippi,�� Bryant told reporters at the Canton plant.The UAW has tried unsuccessfully to organize Nissan workers before. In 2001, workers at Nissan’s Smyrna, Tennessee plant voted overwhelmingly against joining the union.Companies looking to hire workers who are likely to be wooed by union organizers will carefully screen applicants, said Kristin Dziczek, labor relations expert at the Center for Automotive Research.“It is typical for firms to work very closely to screen their new workers for skills and characteristics,�� Dziczek said on Thursday.“I would expect these new workers to be screened for characteristics like gender balance and diversity and be screened for their union proclivities. The union knows it. The company knows it,�� said Dziczek.Nissan’s Krueger said: “We’re looking for great workers with a great attitude and willingness to learn, that’s really the key.”Nissan is aggressively adding to its production of vehicles at the Canton plant, its plant in Smyrna, Tennessee and in Mexico to boost the No. 2 Japanese automaker’s profile in the competitive U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets.Nissan’s goal is to achieve a 10-percent market share, up from 8.2 percent in 2011 and 6.2 percent in 2006, Krueger said.The Sentra for the North American market is now made at the Nissan plant in Aguascalientes in Mexico. Production of the Sentra will continue at Aguascalientes, Nissan officials said.Sentra sales fell 18 percent in the United States through May this year to 46,773, while Altima sales rose 21 percent to 135,289. Overall, Nissan sales, including its luxury Infiniti brand, rose 12 percent through May, less than the auto industry’s gain of 13 percent.In the United States, Nissan is the sixth-largest automaker and the third-biggest import brand after Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd.(Additional reporting by Bijoy Koyitty in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel, Supriya Kurane; editing by Carol Bishopric)	-6.225149105

MEXICO CITY, April 22 (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co is planning to spend $550 million on a new tire plant in Mexico, a person familiar with the matter said, the latest in a string of investment pledges in the country’s booming auto sector.The Goodyear plant, which will begin operations in 2017, will produce tires primarily for the domestic market, said the person, who declined to be named as the investment was not yet public.The company is expected to announce the investment at a joint event with the government on Friday in Mexico City, the person said. Goodyear spokesman Eduardo Arguelles declined to comment.The investment comes shortly after automakers Toyota , Ford and Volkswagen unveiled major expansion plans in Mexico, taking advantage of Mexico’s low wages, free trade agreements and proximity to the United States.Last week, Toyota said it would spend $1 billion on a passenger car plant, and Ford said it would spend $2.5 billion on engine and transmission operations. German Volkswagen said last month it will invest about $1 billion to expand its vehicle assembly plant in Mexico’s Puebla state. (Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)	-2.361199745
"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government defended Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T on Friday as an ""important corporate citizen"" of the United States, after President-elect Donald Trump singled out the automaker and threatened to slap punitive tariffs on its Mexico-built cars.Trump has repeatedly hit out at U.S. companies for using lower-cost factories abroad at the expense of jobs at home. He has slammed U.S. automakers, including Ford F.N which this week scrapped a planned $1.6 billion Mexico plant.But the attack overnight on Toyota is his first against a foreign automaker. “Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,�� Trump tweeted.Toyota shares fell more than 3 percent before recovering, and Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T slid around 2 percent - even as the government and analysts sought to brush off the impact of the attack. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Friday that Toyota was an “important corporate citizen��, while Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko stressed the contribution of Japanese companies to U.S. employment.“We think the impact on business performance is limited,�� Akira Kishimoto, a senior analyst at JP Morgan, said in a note.“A cool judgement is needed.”Toyota’s exposure to Mexico is limited, Kishimoto said, adding that even an “extreme case�� tariff of 20 percent would hit its operating profit by around 6 percent. Trump has threatened a 35 percent tariff on cars imported from Mexico.Toyota is just one of a host of companies operating in Mexico. It has an assembly plant in Baja California, where it produces the Tacoma pick-up truck, and where it could increase production.Trump’s tweet, however, confused Toyota’s existing Baja plant with the planned $1 billion plant in Guanajuato, where construction got under way in November, days after the election.The Guanajuato plant will build Corollas and have an annual capacity of 200,000 when it comes online in 2019, shifting production of the small car from Canada.Baja produces around 100,000 pick-up trucks and truck beds annually. Toyota said in September it would increase output of pick-up trucks by more than 60,000 units annually.Other Japanese automakers and suppliers in Mexico include Nissan, which has been in Mexico for decades after choosing it as the site for its first assembly plant outside Asia. Nissan has two facilities there, producing 830,000 units in the year to March 2016.Honda operates two assembly and engine plants with a total annual capacity of 263,000 vehicles, and a transmission plant with an annual capacity of 350,000 units.Aisin Seiki Co 7259.T and Denso Corp 6902.T, both suppliers to Toyota and other carmakers, have two and three plants, respectively, in Mexico. Parts makers tend to cluster near assembly plants under the industry's ""just-in-time"" production philosophy. "	-5.677183052
NAIROBI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The number of vehicles assembled in Kenya fell by nearly a third between January and April compared with a year earlier, as high interest rates and a slowdown in government projects pushed down demand, data showed.Kenya assembled 2,258 vehicles, down 31 percent compared with January to April 2015, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said.That was in line with a July report from the Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers Association (KVMA) showing vehicle sales fell 30 percent in the first half.Kenya mostly assembles trucks, pick-ups and buses from kits supplied by foreign manufacturers.“The economics are challenging,�� KVMA Chairwoman Rita Kavashe said on Thursday, citing high interest rates and a slowdown in government spending which has meant few projects for contractors in sectors like road construction.Buyers of new vehicles generally rely on bank financing, and rates were as high as 24 percent during the period.Kavashe, who is also managing director of General Motors East Africa, said a real estate lull had also contributed.Other brands assembled in Kenya include Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Isuzu.

SEOUL, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers saw their combined South Korean vehicle sales slump in July, data showed on Monday, after Japan’s export curbs to Korea sparked a consumer backlash.Toyota Motor saw its July sales slump 32% from a year earlier in South Korea, while Honda’s sales skidded 34%, according to data from the Korea Automobile Importers &amp; Distributors Association (KAIDA).In July, Japan tightened controls on exports to South Korea, escalating a row over wartime forced labourers and sparking a boycott of Japanese products by South Korean consumers.

* Nikkei surrenders modest gains, ends day down 0.09%* Lingering trade war concerns, Brexit woes cap market* Recruit slides after announcing share sales, weighs on NikkeiTOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average edged lower on Thursday, as an early Wall Street-led bounce gave way to lingering concerns that trade conflicts and political risks would hurt the global economy.The Nikkei ended the session down 0.09% at 20,460.93, having advanced a modest 0.15% the previous day. The index rose as much as 0.2% in early trade after all three of the major U.S. stock indexes posted gains overnight.But the Nikkei’s rise sputtered on underlying concerns about another flare-up in the U.S.-China trade war and latest developments in the Brexit saga pointing to fresh turbulence in the financial markets ahead.“The market can’t get much of a lift as it waits for Sept. 1 to see if extra U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports actually kick in,�� said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.“U.S. trade adviser (Peter) Navarro’s cautious comments on trade issues also weighed on sentiment,�� Miura said.Global markets remain on edge after the latest flurry of tit-for-tat tariffs between Washington and Beijing, and the lack of firm details on the next round of trade talks between the two countries did little to ease nerves.“I can tell you that it’s unlikely anything quick will happen given the structural basis of the problems,�� White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in an interview with Fox Business Network on Wednesday.There were 127 advancers on the Nikkei index against 87 decliners.The largest percentage decliner was staffing services company Recruit Holdings Co, which retreated 4.8% after it announced plans to sell approximately 7.16% of its outstanding shares through a secondary offering.The biggest percentage gainers were Rakuten Inc, up 2.4%, followed by Taisei Corp for a gain of 2.3% and Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd up by 2.2%.Suzuki Motor Corp rose 1.5%, helped by the carmaker announcing a capital tie-up with Toyota Motor Corp.Shares of Toyota, which will pay around 96 billion yen ($910.90 million) for a 4.94% stake in Suzuki, closed little changed on the day.The broader Topix inched down 0.01% to 1,490.17.The volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board was 0.77 billion, compared to the average of 1.11 billion yen in the past 30 days.

(Repeats story published late on Tuesday with no changes to text.)SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil, March 26 (Reuters) - Meeting in Brazil this week, auto executives from Toyota to GM talked up traditional fuel sources like ethanol, natural gas and diesel, underlining how South America’s protected auto market is likely to resist a broader global move towards electric vehicles for years to come.Even as automakers revamp their global businesses to focus on electric cars in Europe, North America and Asia, executives who oversee production in Brazil and Argentina are still prioritizing internal combustion engines - in part because of subsidies for locally plentiful fuels.“The future of Argentina’s energy is natural gas,�� said Cristiano Rattazzi, who heads the country’s unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, as well as its automakers trade group. He added that diesel fuel, out of favor in much of the world, also still has potential in Argentina.Argentina’s natural gas production is expected to increase dramatically as foreign oil companies and state-owned YPF pour investment into Vaca Muerta, one of the world’s largest shale gas reserves.Aurelio Santana, executive director of Brazil’s auto trade group, had similar things to say about ethanol, which powers many of Brazil’s cars.“It’s very important that the government supports investments in research and development involving ethanol,�� Santana said. “We need to maintain what we already have here.”The desire to stick to what they know underscores the political sway of local energy producers. Recently, Brazil’s legislature issued a series of tax incentives, dubbed Rota 2030, which offer significant benefits to car makers who choose to invest in ethanol research.The event took place in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the historic home of Brazil’s auto industry, which is still reeling from the shock earlier this year that Ford Motor Co would be shutting its plant in the city.Toyota Motor Corp is so far the only automaker to announce that it plans to make even a hybrid model in South America, featuring an engine that can run on electricity or either pure ethanol or gasoline.“It’s the best solution for our region,�� said Celso Simomura, Vice President for Toyota’s Brazil operation.General Motors Co earlier this month announced an investment of 10 billion reais ($2.58 billion) in Brazil over the next five years, but none of that will go to electric cars, said Carlos Zarlenga, GM’s chief for South America.GM will start importing electric vehicles this year to test the market, he added, but there are no plans yet to build them domestically.Volkswagen AG’s top executive for South America and the Caribbean, Pablo Di Si, said the German automaker was going to import six electric or hybrid models to Brazil by 2023. But he also said there were no plans to produce them locally.“In Latin America, we need to consider all the caveats,�� Di Si said, pointing to the lack of a legal framework for electric vehicles and not enough charging infrastructure. Volkswagen wants to sell 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025.Fiat’s Rattazzi was confident that the old ways would survive in South America in the medium term.“In 2030,�� he predicted, “the combustion engine will still have a place.�� ($1 = 3.8768 reais) (Reporting by Marcelo Rochabrun; editing by Christian Plumb and Rosalba O’Brien)	3.9808516

(Reuters) - The auto industry’s air bag troubles deepened on Saturday as U.S. federal safety regulators said three big automakers will recall about 2.1 million older vehicles to fix defects that could cause air bags to deploy when they are not supposed to.The vehicles involved in the recall announced by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are made by Toyota Motor Corp, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co.There have been about 400 reported cases of inadvertent air bag deployments in the recalled vehicles, NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said. The incidents have caused some minor injuries, but no known deaths, he told reporters.The recall concerned a defective chip in air bag systems and the fix involved replacing the entire air bag module, including circuits manufactured by parts maker TRW Automotive Holdings , Rosekind said.The automakers involved had issued three earlier recalls to fix the chip problems. But the NHTSA said it had reports that 39 vehicles fixed under those actions had experienced inadvertent air bag deployments, hence the new recall.It was not related to millions of vehicles recalled over Takata Corp air bags. U.S. safety regulators have said defective Takata air bag inflators in certain vehicles can rupture and spray metal fragments inside the vehicle.Air bag failures were also central to the controversy last year over General Motors Co’s delay in recalling millions of vehicles with defective ignition switches that could unexpectedly cut off power to the safety systems.Honda said that approximately 374,000 Honda and Acura vehicles are affected in the United States.“Honda has received a small number of complaints of inadvertent airbag deployment in these vehicles after the original recall repair was completed,�� Honda said in a statement. “No crashes have been reported to Honda related to this issue.”Noting potential consumer concerns about air bags, the NHTSA said the chances of being involved in a crash in which an air bag could prevent serious injury or death were far greater than the risk of serious injury from an inadvertent bag deployment.NHTSA blamed the problems it reported on Saturday on “electrical noise�� in the air bag system. It said a fully effective solution might not be available until late this year.The agency said the models affected were: 2002-2003 Jeep Liberty and 2002-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees (about 750,000 vehicles); 2003-2004 Honda Odyssey; and 2003 Acura MDX (about 370,000 vehicles) and 2003-2004 Pontiac Vibe; Dodge Viper; and Toyota Corolla, Toyota Matrix, and Toyota Avalon (about 1 million vehicles, not all of which were sold in the United States.)The agency said the affected models had a part called an electronic control unit that controls deployment of its air bags. TRW supplied control units containing the same control circuit to all three automakers.Although the recalls were not related to the Takata cases, the NHTSA said there was an overlap, in that about 1 million of the vehicles affected were also covered in separate recalls of Takata air bag inflator systems.The recall highlights the difficulty automakers and regulators have with increasingly complex electronic systems. The agency said in a statement it could take several months for the companies to obtain enough parts to fix all the vehicles involved.In the Takata cases, Honda on Friday said it has confirmed that a Takata air bag inflator ruptured in a Jan. 18 crash in Texas that killed the driver. Prior to that incident, air bags made by the Japanese company had been linked to at least five deaths. (Additional reporting by Will Dunham in Washington)	2.898550725
(Refiles to include omitted title for Chris Valasek, paragraph 3)BOSTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Two security experts who a year ago exposed methods for hacking the Toyota Prius and Ford Escape say they have developed technology that would keep automobiles safe from cyber attacks.At last summer’s Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas, the two researchers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller, described ways to launch dangerous attacks, including manipulating the brakes of the moving Prius and the Ford Escape.Valasek, director of vehicle security research at the consulting firm IOActive, told Reuters on Tuesday that he and Miller will show off a prototype vehicle “intrusion prevention device�� at next month’s Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas.They built the device with about $150 in electronics parts, though the real “secret sauce�� is a set of computer algorithms that listen to traffic in a car’s network to understand how things are supposed to work. When an attack occurs, the device identifies traffic anomalies and blocks rogue activity, Valasek said.The two well-known computer experts decided to pursue the project because they wanted to help automakers identify ways to defend against security vulnerabilities in their products.“I really don’t care if you hack my browser and steal my credit card,�� Valasek said. “But crashing a car is life or death. It is dramatic. We wanted to be part of the solution.”The research the two have released on the Ford and Toyota cars, as well as work by other experts on different types of vehicles, has raised concerns that somebody might one day try to replicate their work to launch a real-life attack.Yet the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement on Tuesday that it is not aware of any incidents of consumer vehicle control systems having been hacked.The auto industry has beefed up efforts to identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity risks over the past few years.“Cyber security is a global concern and it is a growing threat for all industries, including the automotive,�� said Jack Pokrzywa, manager of global ground vehicle standards with SAE International, a group that represents industry engineers.Pokrzywa declined to comment on the specifics of the new technology from Valasek and Miller, though he said “Any viable solution reducing cyber threats is a step in the right direction.”A representative for Ford said she had no immediate comment on the device. Officials with Toyota could not be reached for comment. (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Dan Grebler)	-3.777852237
GAYDON, England (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, will halt production at its British factories for a week in November, its boss said on Thursday, joining BMW and Toyota in plans to help mitigate any immediate disruption from a no-deal Brexit.The industry, Britain’s biggest exporter of goods, has been vocal about its concerns that a disorderly departure from the European Union could disrupt the flow of components and vehicles, ruining production processes and damaging the viability of factories.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU, with or without an exit deal, on Oct. 31. However, it remains unclear whether that will actually happen or if Brexit will be delayed, put back to a referendum or even cancelled.Chief Executive Ralf Speth said that Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)had to make plans now, including a stop to production at its four British factories during the first week of November.“We cannot think about it, we just have to do it,�� he told reporters at an event in Gaydon, central England, to mark the opening of a new advanced product creation centre.“I need 20 million parts a day and that means I have to make commitments to my suppliers, I have to have every and each part available and I have to have it just in time,�� he said.The move will affect the firm’s three car factories, which built just under a third of Britain’s 1.5 million cars last year, and its engine facility in Wolverhampton.Japanese carmarker Toyota said in August it would not build cars at its British factory on Nov. 1 while BMW will halt production at its Oxford plant on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1.Speth said JLR would also change shift patterns at its Halewood factory near Liverpool leading to a cut in output due to the “cyclical challenge�� facing the car industry, which has prompted profit warnings and forecast cuts at a number of firms.Speth, who has led JLR for nearly a decade, has taken the company through a rapid expansion overseas but more recently the firm has posted losses due to a slowdown in China and a hit to diesel sales, particularly in Europe.Speth’s current term at JLR is due to end next year, a source previously told Reuters.Speth said he was still enjoying his time at the carmaker.“I started here in 2010 and all my predecessors only survived for two years or so,�� he said.“Working for this iconic and authentic brand is a lot of fun, so as long as it’s fun, it’s just wonderful to be there.��	1.511593778
WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Four automakers agreed to a $553 million settlement to address class-action economic loss claims covering owners of nearly 16 million recalled vehicles with potentially defective Takata airbag inflators, court documents filed on Thursday showed.Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T share of the settlement costs is $278.5 million, followed by BMW AG BMWG.DE at $131 million, Mazda Motor Co 7261.T at $76 million and Subaru Corp 7270.T at $68 million.While the settlement does not mean an end to legal headaches faced by Takata Corp 7312.T or its car maker clients, the resolution could help the embattled Japanese air bag maker's efforts to search for a financial sponsor by removing one litigation uncertainty.Shares of Takata, which was not named as a plaintiff in the case, jumped 20 percent in Tokyo on Friday. Takata has been searching for more than a year to find a financial sponsor to pay for costs to replace its inflators which are at the center of the auto industry’s biggest-ever recall.U.S. auto components maker Key Safety Systems (KSS) and private equity fund Bain Capital are trying to strike a rescue deal worth around 200 billion yen with Takata’s steering committee and its automaker customers.The settlement highlights the knock-on effect of the recalls, which began around 2008 and covers around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers.Takata’s inflators can explode with excessive force and unleash metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks, and are blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide.“This is a settlement between us and our customers,�� said a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Mazda.Lawsuits against Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Ford Motor Co F.N and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T have not been settled, lawyers said.Takata declined to comment on the settlement.The four automakers who settled said in a joint statement they agreed to the deal “given the size, scope and severity of the Takata recall,�� but did not admit fault or liability. The automakers said the settlements, if approved by a Florida judge, will be overseen by a court-appointed administrator.The settlement includes an outreach program to contact owners; compensation for economic losses including out-of-pocket expenses; a possible residual distribution payment of up to $500; rental cars for some owners; and a customer support program for repairs and adjustments, including an extended warranty.In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to U.S. charges of criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a federal investigation into its inflators. The majority of the air bag-related fatalities and injuries have occurred in the United States.Automakers have recalled 46 million Takata air bag inflators in 29 million U.S. vehicles. By 2019, automakers will recall 64 million to 69 million U.S. inflators in 42 million vehicles, regulators said in December. Most inflators have not been fixed.	-2.658981034
TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States will begin an investigation into whether thermoplastic components used in some Japanese and German vehicle models sold in the country violate its patent laws, trade authorities said late last week.The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) on Friday listed 25 companies in the probe, including BMW, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Toyota Motor Corp, along with Japanese parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co Ltd and Denso Corp.The probe was initiated by patent holding firm Intellectual Ventures II, which in March filed a complaint alleging that thermoplastic parts used in motors, water pumps, electronic power steering units and other powertrain parts made by or used in vehicles sold by the companies infringe on its patents.Used in parts which come in contact with high-temperature auto components, thermoplastics are more lightweight and durable compared with other materials used in vehicle powertrains, helping to increase efficiency and improve fuel economy.The complaint affects vehicle models sold in the United States including the 2016 Toyota Camry, 2017 Honda Accord and the 2016 BMW 228i, according to the patent company.The USITC said it would set a target date to complete its investigation within 45 days of starting the probe.Shares in Honda and Toyota were little changed during the Tokyo session on Monday.A Toyota spokeswoman declined to comment on the issue, while officials in Japan at BMW, Honda, Aisin and Denso were not immediately available for comment.	-0.701754386
* Toyota says exit will affect about 2,500 jobs* Follows similar plans announced last year by GM, Ford* High costs, strong Aussie dollar hurt competitivenessSYDNEY, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Monday it would stop making cars and engines in Australia by the end of 2017, marking the end of an era for a once-vibrant auto production base and the loss of thousands of direct and indirect jobs.Toyota’s decision follows the planned exits of General Motors and Ford Motor announced last year and would leave no global automaker remaining in Australia as high costs and a strong currency make it an unattractive production base.“We did everything that we could to transform our business, but the reality is that there are too many factors beyond our control that make it unviable to build cars in Australia,�� Toyota Australia President Max Yasuda said in a statement.About 2,500 jobs will be affected when the plant stops building cars in 2017, the company said.Toyota’s exit from Australia after more than half a century there is a setback to Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s conservative government, which is seeking to manage a slowdown in the $1.5 trillion economy as a decade-long mining investment boom slows.“This is obviously devastating news for everyone involved with Toyota. It’s devastating for me and for the government,�� Abbott said in Canberra.Union leaders were more vocal in their criticism of the government’s handling of the auto industry’s woes.“The loss of the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia will have far reaching consequences around the country and throughout the economy,�� said Australia Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Secretary David Oliver.“They’ve (the government) done absolutely nothing to keep Toyota in this country,�� he added, warning that A$21 billion ($18.80 billion) would be wiped from the economy and that some regions would go into recession.The ACTU groups the main Australian trade unions under an umbrella group.A pullout by Toyota had been widely feared because of the blow to the parts supply base from the flight of GM and Ford.“It’s a huge moment for industry in Australia,�� Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane told reporters in Canberra after Toyota’s announcement.“Toyota have made no requests to us other than express their frustration with the difficulty they were having with the industrial relations process,�� he said, when asked whether Toyota had sought financial assistance or other forms of aid.Australia’s car industry includes about 150 companies working in sectors from components to tooling, design and engineering, with more than 45,000 people employed directly in the car and parts-making sectors, according to government data.While Australians bought a record 1.14 vehicles last year, according to the Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, the proportion made domestically was a record low at barely 10 percent. Toyota was the top-selling brand, holding nearly one-fifth of the market.Vehicle production in Australia has nearly halved in the past decade to just above 200,000 in 2012 from more than 400,000 in 2004. Sales of locally made vehicles have suffered in recent years as a stronger Australian dollar makes imported cars more competitive.In contrast, global automakers have been building new factories and ramping up capacity in countries like Indonesia, where a burgeoning middle class and lower costs make it an increasingly attractive production base.	-6.530404546
TOKYO (Reuters) - Metropolitan Tokyo asked some businesses to close and the ancient capital of Kyoto warned tourists to stay away as Japan battles a fast-spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus, amid fears the government’s measures are too little and too late.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said she was targeting a range of businesses for shutdowns from Saturday during a month-long emergency through May 6, after resolving a feud with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s team over the extent of the closures.Koike had wanted to move sooner but Abe has resisted measures likely to put greater pressure on an economy which is already tipped to fall into recession, fuelling concerns that the central government is putting business ahead of people’s lives.“This will be tough on residents but if we act swiftly, the pain will be short and the outbreak contained quickly,�� Koike told a task force meeting on Friday.Businesses including pachinko parlours and internet cafes are being asked to close and restaurants to shorten their hours. Department stores, home-furnishing centres and barber shops will be exempted, in a concession to the central government.Abe declared an emergency on Tuesday for Tokyo and six other prefectures but the details and timing of how life would change in the capital were thrashed out in tense inter-governmental talks.“I thought governors would get authority akin to a CEO but ... I feel more like a middle manager,�� Koike told reporters in a sign of frustration over central government pressure.Abe’s move came after a jump in coronavirus cases in Tokyo sparked concern that Japan was headed for the sort of explosive outbreak seen in many other countries.The number of cases in Japan rose to 6,003 on Friday, with 112 deaths, NHK said. Tokyo accounted for 1,708 cases, heightening concerns about sluggish action.The governor of Aichi in Japan’s industrial heartland, which hosts Toyota Motor Corp, declared its own state of emergency on Friday and has asked to be added to the government’s targeted regions. Gifu in central Japan was also poised to issue an emergency declaration and at least one other prefecture was set to do the same, media said.The governor of Kyoto prefecture and the mayor of the ancient capital also asked to be included in the national emergency, and urged tourists to stay away from the city’s famous palaces, temples and gardens.“I call on all people who love Kyoto and tourists from all over the world - until this situation is ended, to protect yourself and your families, please refrain from visiting Kyoto,�� Mayor Daisaku Kadokawa told a news conference.Critics say the Abe government’s cautious approach to business closures will undermine his goal to cut person-to-person contact by 80% to slow the spread of the pathogen.SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son took to twitter to query the government’s handling of the outbreak.“Why has Japan put its economy minister in charge?�� he asked, comparing the Japanese government’s response to the leadership of Antoni Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases in the United States.Tokyo Governor Koike had warned in March that the capital could face a full “lockdown�� if infections surged, although Japanese law does not mandate penalties for residents who refuse to stay home or businesses that stay open.Koike also said that businesses that met her requests to close would receive between 500,000 yen ($4,595) and 1 million yen from a fund set up by the metropolitan government.Abe has rejected calls to compensate such businesses from the central government’s purse.The new coronavirus has pushed 51 Japanese companies into bankruptcy with a spike in new cases seen in April, Tokyo Shoko Research said on Friday.Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.($1 = 108.8139 yen)	1.946231239
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.Squabbles over remote islands have sparked a Chinese backlash against Japanese brands. But China’s slowing economy is having an even bigger impact on Japan’s exports. And while China has toppled the U.S. as Japan’s biggest market, both nations face a common economic enemy in the form of plunging demand from Europe.The slump in Japan’s exports in September may seem a direct hit from violent anti-Japanese demonstrations last month over a disputed group of islands in the East China Sea. After Japanese auto dealerships were torched and a mob in Xi’an assaulted an unlucky Toyota Corolla owner, sales of Japanese cars have plummeted. Earlier this month, Toyota said China sales in September halved from the same month a year ago. That’s consistent with the 10 percent decline in overall Japanese exports and a 14 percent drop in shipments to China.But the protests are really a symptom of China’s deeper economic trouble �� a sharp slowdown in domestic growth combined with sluggish demand for its own exports. Economic pressure shortens the public fuse, and nationalism is an all-too-tempting way for politicians to deflect blame. Japanese exports to China have been falling since late last year �� they’re down 10 percent so far this year, and 12 percent in the third quarter.China is Japan’s largest export market, overtaking the European Union in 2006 and the United States in 2009. And while the country is a growing consumer of Japanese goods, most of what it imports is the heavy industrial machinery needed to make the products that Japan used to manufacture. The only bright spot for either country is a sluggish recovery in U.S. demand. Japan’s exports to the United States rose 5 percent in the third quarter; China’s were up 3 percent.If there is a word for what really ails Japanese exports it is neither Diaoyu nor Senkaku, but Europe. Japan’s exports to the European Union dropped 23 percent in the third quarter, their sharpest decline since 2009. China’s exports to the same destination were down 40 percent over the same period, the largest drop since at least 1990. When it comes to exports, China and Japan share a common foe.	10.20854789
TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Toyota Motor Corp executive Julie Hamp was freed from police custody on Wednesday after Tokyo prosecutors said they would not indict her for suspected illegal importing of the painkiller Oxycodone into Japan.Hamp, a U.S. citizen who became Toyota’s chief communications officer and first female managing officer in April, had been held since her June 18 arrest. She resigned from the world’s largest automaker last week.An official at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office told reporters that prosecutors had taken into account the “social penalty�� she had already incurred with her resignation from Toyota.Local media had said on Tuesday that Hamp was unlikely to be charged because prosecutors judged there was little criminal intent in the case, which arose when her father mailed her the pills to alleviate knee pain. The highly addictive Oxycodone pills, found in a small parcel labeled “necklaces��, had been placed in packets or buried at the bottom of the box, media reported.Wednesday was the last day that Hamp could be held without formal charges.Anticipating her release, dozens of journalists waited for hours outside the police station in Tokyo where she had been held but were only able to catch a glimpse of her as she was whisked into a Toyota Alphard minivan. Hamp, 55, held a black briefcase to her face as she emerged from the building.A former General Motors Co and PepsiCo Inc executive, Hamp was promoted to her executive post in Toyota in April as part of a drive to diversify Toyota’s male-dominated, mostly Japanese line-up of senior management. She joined Toyota’s North American unit in 2012 and had just relocated to Tokyo in June.Toyota in a statement apologized for the incident, repeating that it remained committed to “putting the right people in the right places�� regardless of nationality or gender. It added that Senior Managing Officer Shigeru Hayakawa had been appointed to replace Hamp as chief communications officer effective July 6.Oxycodone is a prescription drug in both the United States and Japan. Bringing it into Japan requires prior approval from the government and it must be carried by the individual.	1.436265709
LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Toyota said it will invest 240 million pounds ($294 million) in its British car plant to allow it to build vehicles on a new platform, helping to boost competitiveness and promote the use of locally-built components.But the firm, which currently its Auris hatchback and family Avensis car at its Burnaston plant in the north of England, warned that continued tariff-free access to the European single market remained crucial as Britain leaves the EU.“Our investment demonstrates that, as a company, we are doing all we can to raise the competitiveness of our Burnaston plant in Derbyshire,�� President and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe Dr Johan van Zyl said.“Continued tariff-and-barrier free market access between the UK and Europe that is predictable and uncomplicated will be vital for future success.��	-5.427323768
NEWPORT BEACH, California, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Monday said it will introduce its first mass-market fuel cell car in the United States next year, hoping to replicate the success of its Prius hybrid with a vehicle that runs on hydrogen instead of gasoline.The four-person sedan named Mirai, the Japanese word for “future��, will be at California dealerships in the fourth quarter of 2015. Only 200 will be available in the United States next year, with volumes increasing to 3,000 by 2017, executives said at a press conference in Newport Beach, California.The Mirai will cost $57,500, which could drop to $45,000 after federal and state incentives. Toyota expects most customers will choose a three-year lease for $499 a month.Fuel cell vehicles run on electricity from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen and emit only water vapor. But there are few hydrogen fuel stations in the world, and that lack of infrastructure is a major challenge for carmakers.Toyota is investing in fuel stations in both California and the Northeastern United States. California has pledged up to $200 million over the next 10 years to build 100 stations.Governments and consumers, concerned about high oil prices and climate-warming tailpipe emissions, have been pushing automakers to develop vehicles that use little or no gasoline.Toyota has benefited from that trend with its Prius hybrid.But rather than banking on mass adoption of battery electric vehicles, as rivals including Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Tesla Motors Inc have done, Toyota thinks fuel cells are the future because they can deliver a longer driving range.The company will put 700 Mirai cars in the market globally next year, rising to the “tens of thousands�� in the 2020s, Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada said.The Mirai can go 300 miles before refueling, according to executives.“This technology is going to change our world,�� Toyota Managing Officer Satoshi Ogiso said at the event.Toyota expects the Mirai’s trajectory will be similar to that of the Prius. It took a decade for Prius sales to reach 1 million units.There are currently only three fuel cell vehicles in the United States: the Honda FCX Clarity, Mercedes-Benz F-Cell and the Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Reuters) - Malaysian canning company, Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, has accepted a 1.46 billion ringgit ($442.42 million) takeover offer from private company Aspire Insight Sdn Bhd, according to a stock exchange filing late Monday.The acceptance comes despite Kian Joo getting a higher offer, on a per share basis, from Japan’s Toyota Tsusho Corp to buy 51 percent of the company earlier this month.Tsusho’s offer is 13 percent higher than the 3.30 ringgit per share offer from Aspire made in November last year.Kian Joo did not explain why it chose the Aspire offer but said the sale represented an opportunity for shareholders to realise their investments at a premium.Upon completion of the deal, Kian Joo said it would distribute the 1.46 billion ringgit proceeds to entitled shareholders in cash via a proposed capital reduction and repayment exercise.Kian Joo’s major shareholders include fellow canning company Can-One Bhd.($1 = 3.3000 Malaysian ringgit)	-1.309238429
* Nissan shifts focus from EVs to hybrids* Toyota considers hydrogen fuel cells* EV demand falls far short of expectationsTOKYO/DETROIT, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Are electric cars running out of juice again?Recent moves by Japan’s two largest automakers suggest that the electric car, after more than 100 years of development and several brief revivals, still is not ready for prime time - and may never be.In the meantime, the attention of automotive executives in Asia, Europe and North America is beginning to swing toward an unusual but promising new alternate power source: hydrogen.The reality is that consumers continue to show little interest in electric vehicles, or EVs, which dominated U.S. streets in the first decade of the 20th century before being displaced by gasoline-powered cars.Despite the promise of “green�� transportation - and despite billions of dollars in investment, most recently by Nissan Motor Co - EVs continue to be plagued by many of the problems that eventually scuttled electrics in the 1910s and more recently in the 1990s. Those include high cost, short driving range and lack of charging stations.The public’s lack of appetite for battery-powered cars persuaded the Obama administration last week to back away from its aggressive goal to put 1 million electric cars on U.S. roads by 2015.The tepid response to EVs also pushed Nissan’s high-profile chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, perhaps the industry’s most outspoken proponent of battery cars, to announce in December a major strategic shift toward more mainstream gasoline-electric hybrids, which overcome many of the shortcomings of pure EVs.The move was widely seen as a tacit acknowledgement by Ghosn that his all-or-nothing, multibillion-dollar bet on EVs is falling far short of his ambition to sell hundreds of thousands of battery-powered Nissan Leafs.Instead, Nissan plans to follow rival Toyota Motor Co , the world’s largest purveyor of hybrids, which now is poised to leapfrog pure EVs altogether to pursue what might be the next big green-tech breakthrough: pollution- and petroleum-free fuel-cell cars that convert hydrogen to electricity.Vice Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, the “father of the Prius�� who helped put hybrids on the map, said he believes fuel-cell vehicles hold far more promise than battery electric cars.“Because of its shortcomings - driving range, cost and recharging time - the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars,�� said Uchiyamada. “We need something entirely new.”In the race to identify the Next Big Thing in automotive technology, the stakes are enormous.For example, Nissan, with French partner Renault, has committed $5 billion for development and manufacture of EVs and batteries - a risky bet that could take years to pay off - while Toyota has spent an estimated $10 billion or more over the past 16 years to develop, build and market an ever-expanding range of hybrids, led by the popular and now profitable Prius.While neither Nissan nor Toyota is likely to pull the plug on electric cars, it is clear from their recent moves that both companies are looking beyond EVs to meet future transportation needs.Both automakers began advanced green-car engineering programs in the mid-1990s, with Toyota introducing the first-generation Prius hybrid and Nissan unveiling the battery-powered Altra in late 1997.Toyota brought the Prius to the United States in 2000, but it took Nissan another 10 years to follow the low-volume Altra and other modest electric-car projects such as the Hypermini with the handsomely funded 2010 launch of the Leaf.With Uchiyamada overseeing continuous refinement of the Prius, Toyota took a 10-year lead in the green-car derby. Along the way, though, Toyota effectively subsidized billions of dollars in development, manufacturing and marketing costs through the first two generations of the Prius, according to former Toyota executives.While it took the Toyota hybrid six years to catch fire with U.S. consumers, the latest sales data points to the widening chasm between the two companies�� radically different approaches to electrification.In the past year, Toyota has broadened its hybrid portfolio to 12 models, including four versions of the Prius, now in its third generation. Toyota in 2012 sold 327,413 hybrids in the United States and 1.2 million globally. Worldwide sales of its hybrids now approach 5 million.The Prius accounts for more than half of those sales, making it the most successful green car in history and one of the few exceptions to the public’s yawning indifference to green vehicles and technology.The Leaf, on the other hand, has been the rule rather than the exception.Nissan unveiled the Leaf two years ago and to date has sold just under 50,000 worldwide. It sold 9,819 last year in the United States, well under its target of 20,000.As part of a year-end sales push, Nissan slapped incentives of almost $6,000 on the Leaf, and in January slashed the starting price by more than $6,000, to $29,650. Some Nissan dealers in Los Angeles are advertising Leaf lease rates as low as $199 a month with $1,999 down, according to industry research firm TrueCar.“When new technologies are launched, sales do not grow as quickly as everyone expects,�� said Mitsuhiko Yamashita, Nissan executive vice president and head of research and development. But “with EV technologies continuously improving and with prices falling, there is a possibility that sales could explode.”That isn’t likely to happen anytime soon.Nissan may be mildly encouraged that the Leaf is the best-selling pure EV in the United States. But total EV sales last year were only 14,687, representing 0.1 percent of total U.S. sales of 14.5 million. In comparison, hybrid sales in 2012 climbed to 473,083, or roughly 3.3 percent of the market. And of every three hybrids sold last year in the United States, two were a Toyota or a Lexus.Fueled by government subsidies and tax incentives, hybrid sales in Japan have rocketed to 40 percent of the industry total, with the Prius a top seller. Hybrids, however, have been far less popular with consumers in such major markets as Europe and China.“WE ARE PRAGMATIC PEOPLE”The outlook for pure electric vehicles is even more cloudy.At the moment, Ghosn’s heady 2009 prediction that electric vehicles would capture 10 percent of the global market by 2020 - 6 million battery-powered cars a year or more - doesn’t seem remotely within reach.Yet the gradual tightening of global fuel-efficiency standards from 2020 on is forcing automakers to assess their options, including the application of advanced technology.Says Nissan’s Yamashita: “It is not possible to meet (future) regulations unless vehicles are electrified.”The harsh reality of the market and the public’s underwhelming demand for EVs, however, illuminate Nissan’s recent decision to shift more of its green-tech investment into hybrids.In December the company announced it plans to introduce 15 new hybrids globally by early 2017.At the time, Ghosn said, “We are going to continue to heavily promote electric cars, but at the same time, we are business people, we are pragmatic people. We will also develop and deliver hybrids because there are markets and consumers that require hybrids.”Last September, Toyota publicly walked away from plans to build several thousand electric cars, scaling back projected volume to a mere 100 battery-powered minicars.Both Japanese automakers, meanwhile, have forged new alliances to develop hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars, Toyota with BMW and, in a deal announced last week, Nissan with Daimler AG and Ford Motor Co.In the meantime, despite massive investments in battery technology and vehicles, even the most ardent EV adherents seem a bit ambivalent about the future of battery cars.“We don’t regret it yet,�� says Nissan’s Yamashita of the company’s multibillion-dollar gamble on EVs. “We might in a few years. No, we probably won’t.��	4.450738418
DETROIT (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry powered ahead in August, topping sales estimates and shrugging off gyrating stock markets as consumers continued to show their penchant for pickup trucks and SUVs.U.S. auto sales were the strongest in any month since July 2005. The annualized selling rate in August was 17.8 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp, well above expectations of 17.3 million.The six largest automakers in the U.S. market all beat the sales forecasts of industry analysts, with Toyota, Honda, Nissan and GM reporting declines that were not as severe as expected.Roller-coaster stock markets appeared to have no major impact on auto purchases, which each month are an early indicator of consumer spending.“All of the economic fundamentals that we look at, including job growth, disposable income and fuel prices, are in good shape and that should keep sales strong,�� said Kurt McNeil, head of U.S. sales for General Motors Co GM.N.Bill Fay, head of Toyota brand sales in the U.S. market, pointed out that U.S. consumer confidence in August was at its highest since January.GM, the No. 1 automaker in the U.S. market, reported that sales dropped 0.7 percent.Ford Motor Co F.N, the No. 2 U.S. automaker by vehicle sales, showed a gain of 5 percent, easily outdistancing expectations.Toyota Motor Corp 7203.TTM.N, No. 3 in U.S. sales, reported an 8.8 percent decline in August.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU.NFCHA.MI showed a rise of 2 percent, boosted by Jeep SUVs. Analysts had been looking for a decline in FCA sales.Honda Motor Co 7267.THMC.N reported a drop of 7 percent and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T a 1 percent dip.August industry sales were expected to be down largely based on a quirk in the calendar that put results over the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend into September sales.Although Labor Day is always in September, the U.S. auto industry usually counts the sales in August results.Ford said sales of its F-Series pickup trucks topped 70,000 for the first time this year - at 71,332, up 4.7 percent.Mark LeNeve, head of Ford’s U.S. sales, said Ford SUV and truck sales both rose about 12 percent while car sedan sales fell 7 percent.GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks together outsold Ford’s F-Series, at more than 76,000. Silverado sales rose 11.7 percent and Sierra sales were up 7 percent.	2.644108145

"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Monday it planned to build a prototype ""city of the future"" at the base of Japan's Mt. Fuji, powered by hydrogen fuel cells and functioning as a laboratory for autonomous cars, ""smart homes,"" artificial intelligence and other technologies.Toyota unveiled the audacious plan for what it will call “Woven City��, in a reference to its origins as a loom manufacturer, at the big annual technology industry show, CES.“It’s hard to learn something about a smart city if you are only building a smart block,�� James Kuffner, chief executive officer for the Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development, told Reuters.The “Woven City�� idea, under discussion for a year, is aimed at creating safer, cleaner, more fun cities and learning lessons that could be applied around the world, he added.It will have police, fire and ambulance services, schools and could be home to a mix of Toyota employees, retirees and others, Kuffner said.The development, to be built on the site of a car factory that is planned to be closed by the end of 2020, will begin with 2,000 residents in coming years, and also serve as a home to researchers.Toyota did not disclose costs for the project, whose construction is scheduled to start next year, and which seeks to re-imagine a city, but executives said it had been extensively vetted and had a budget.The plan for a futuristic community on 175 acres (71 hectares) is a big step beyond proposals from Toyota’s rivals.Executives at many major automakers have talked about how cities of the future could be designed to cut climate-changing emissions, reduce congestion and apply internet technology to everyday life.The company’s proposal showcases not only the ambition of Chief Executive Akio Toyoda, but also the financial and political resources Toyota can bring to bear, especially in its home country.“You know if you build it, they will come,�� said Toyoda, who called the project “my personal ‘field of dreams.’�Toyota Housing, a company unit, has sold more than 100,000 homes in Japan in 37 years.Toyota said it had commissioned Danish architect Bjarke Ingels to design the community. Ingels�� firm designed the 2 World Trade Center building in New York and technology giant Google’s offices in Silicon Valley and London.Toyota said it is open to partnerships with other companies seeking to use the project as a testing ground for technology.Still Toyoda acknowledged not all may see the wisdom of what could be an expensive and lengthy project.“You may be thinking, ‘Has this guy lost his mind?’� Toyoda asked an audience in Las Vegas, to laughter. “�Is he like a Japanese version of Willy Wonka?�� Perhaps.��"	1.653593386

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday gave final approval to the settlement of a class action lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corp by plaintiffs who claimed design defects caused some of the company’s vehicles to accelerate without warning.U.S. District Judge James Selna in California gave final approval during a court hearing on Friday, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. The settlement was initially approved in December.The terms include direct payments to customers as well as free installation of brake-override systems in an estimated 3.25 million eligible vehicles, and the establishment of a customer support program, according to court filings.Plaintiffs�� lawyers valued the deal at more than $1.6 billion, calling it “a landmark, if not a record, settlement in automobile defect class action litigation in the United States,�� according to court filings. The lawsuit was filed in 2010.Toyota, which has the third largest share of the U.S. auto market, announced in December that it would take a one-time pre-tax charge of $1.1 billion to cover the estimated settlement costs. It has denied any wrongdoing.“This agreement allows us to resolve a legacy legal issue in a way that provides significant value to our customers and demonstrates that they can depend on Toyota to stand behind our vehicles,�� Toyota spokeswoman Celeste Migliore said in a statement following the hearing Friday.Concerns about potential unintended acceleration issues caused Toyota to recall more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011. Plaintiffs said in the lawsuit that media reports and consumer complaints about the alleged defects caused the trade-in value for their vehicles to plummet.The settlement of the lawsuit covers economic losses stemming from the alleged safety defects, but does not include claims of wrongful death, personal injury or property damage.More than 22 million potential class members have been notified of the settlement, according to court filings. Owners of affected Toyota, Lexus and Scion models sold in the United States have until July 29 to decide whether to participate in the settlement and file claims, according to court filings.Plaintiffs�� lawyers are seeking $200 million in fees and $27 million for their expenses, the filings said.	-1.611665388
TOKYO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it planned for all four of its vehicle assembly plants in China to be in operation from next week after weeks of stoppages due to the coronavirus outbreak, although output at some plants would be limited.The Japanese auto maker said in a statement that production at its vehicle assembly plant in Chengdu, Sichuan province would resume from Monday.Toyota began partial production at plants in Tianjin Province and other regions this week.	-17.39162763
"GUANGZHOU, China/Shanghai (Reuters) - China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) market is likely to see a sales rebound next year as automakers roll out more new products to lure buyers, but more supportive government policies are needed, auto executives said.China has been a keen supporter of NEVs and has implemented production quota requirements for automakers. However it cut subsidies for NEVs substantialy this year as part of an overall plan to reduce subsidies, making the vehicles costlier. In October, NEV sales fell 45.6% from year-ago levels.Prior to the subsidy cut, China’s market for NEVs - which include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells - had been a bright spot, with sales jumping 62% last year.""For next year, we foresee the NEV market will continue to grow, maybe not as dramatic as it was in the past,"" Stephan Woellenstein, Volkswagen Group's VOWG_p.DE chief in China told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the Guangzhou Autoshow last week. A key part of the revival is linked to more big automakers launching NEV models, he said, as it help NEVs become more mainstream. “This normally makes a difference and will also change consumer perception and drive the market.”Carmakers such as Volkswagen, Toyota’s Lexus, Daimler’s Mercedes Benz and Tesla came out in force at the Guangzhou Autoshow to showcase newly launched electric vehicles with fresh designs.Brian Gu, president of Guangzhou-based electric vehicle start-up XPeng which just raised $400 million from Xiaomi and other investors, said he believed that improvements to the country’s charging infrastructure would help NEV sales to recover next year.Another positive is the falling prices of NEV as more automakers started producing vehicles, he added.“In about two years time, from my perspectives, electric vehicles will be significantly cheaper than ICEs (internal combustion engine cars), as battery costs come down very rapidly and volumes will drag down cost.”However, not all executives who spoke to Reuters were optimistic. Ma Fanglie, general manager of BAIC Group’s electric vehicle unit BAIC BluePark, said the industry is “feeling a lot of pressure�� and that more supportive policies were needed.Fu Bingfeng, executive vice chairman of China’s top auto industry body China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) told Reuters government bodies were discussing ways to support the industry in the mid-to-long term.“Our works now will focus on boosting real consumption-side demands, including improving infrastructures and supply chain.��"	-0.309924632
The author is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews. The opinions expressed are his own.Toyota Motor could make a handy tune-up with a buyout of Daihatsu Motor. The world’s biggest carmaker is considering taking out minority shareholders in its $5.4 billion subsidiary, in what amounts to a sensible bit of house-keeping. A bolder follow-up would be to take control of affiliate Subaru.Responding to a report in Japan’s Nikkei newspaper, Toyota says it constantly ponders its relationship with Daihatsu, of which it owns slightly more than half. That includes thinking about partnerships or a restructuring leading to whole ownership.A full buyout would be a long way from transformational for Toyota, whose own market value exceeds $190 billion. However, it would still eliminate inefficiencies. While Daihatsu’s focus on mini-vehicles caps profitability, greater purchasing power and cutting overlaps would help Toyota lift the unit’s 9 percent EBITDA margins closer to the group’s 15-percent-odd level. Plus small cars, vital to any push deeper into emerging markets, are something of a weak spot at Toyota.A deal would also eliminate one of the troublesome “parent-child�� relationships between listed parent and majority-owned subsidiary that are too prevalent in Japan. Investors in the parent tend to worry they don’t get all they might out of ownership; investors in the subsidiary fret that they can be short-changed in dealings between the two sides. Bringing the two together should in theory create value on both sides.Moreover, a share swap would be a good way to soak up some of Toyota’s huge store of treasury stock, which as of end-September was equivalent to nearly 9 percent of its outstanding shares.Further out, Toyota could try some bolder dealmaking. On Jan. 27 both it and Suzuki Motor roundly denied reports of a tie-up �� no surprise given the fiercely independent Suzuki has just extricated itself from a failed alliance with Volkswagen, and competes head-on with Daihatsu in Japan’s small “kei�� car market.A better option could be to buy Subaru from Fuji Heavy Industries. Toyota already owns 16.5 percent of Subaru, which has transformed itself into something approaching the Japanese Volvo: making rugged SUVs that sell well in North America. Not something you can say of Daihatsu’s tiddlers.	-10.35136066
Astralis completed the signing of Patrick “es3tag�� Hansen to their Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team, the Danish organization announced Wednesday.The 24-year-old es3tag, who agreed to join Astralis on March 22, is slated to return to activity for the first time in over three months. He joins Astralis on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract with Heroic.The agreement in March came with issue as the transfer of Heroic’s lineup to FunPlus Phoenix fell through despite the team having already been unveiled by the Chinese organization. Heroic CEO Erik Askered said in a statement at the time that Astralis had “acted in bad faith.”Es3tag had been with Heroic since June 2017 after stints with Team Orbit and Tricked Esport, among other teams. He helped Heroic win the Toyota Master CS:GO Bangkok 2018 and the DreamHack Open Atlanta 2019.Astralis�� roster is now comprised of seven players following the May signing of Jakob “JUGi�� Hansen.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Emperor Naruhito is set to proclaim his enthronement next week in a centuries-old ceremony attended by some 2,000 people, including heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 170 countries.Emperor Naruhito, 59, acceded to the throne in May after his father, Akihito, became the first monarch to abdicate in two centuries.Following are the main events planned for Oct. 22, a one-off national holiday.Emperor Naruhito, like his father nearly three decades ago, will wear a traditional robe and headdress to the ceremony that will start at 1:00 p.m. (0400 GMT) at the Imperial Palace’s Matsu no ma, or Hall of Pine, the most prestigious space in the palace.He will declare his enthronement from the “Takamikura�� - a 6.5-metre-high (21-foot) pavilion that weighs about 8 tonnes - with a sword and a jewel, two of the so-called Three Sacred Treasures, placed beside him.Together with a mirror called Yata-no-Kagami, kept at the Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest site in Japan’s Shinto religion, the ancient sword and jewel comprise the regalia that symbolizes the legitimacy of the emperor.Emperor Akihito pledged during the previous ceremony in 1990 to observe Japan’s pacifist constitution and fulfill his duty as a symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.Emperor Naruhito’s proclamation will be followed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s congratulatory address. Abe will then lead three cheers for the new emperor, bringing the 30-minute ceremony to a close.About 16.1 billion yen ($148 million) has been earmarked for succession-related ceremonies throughout the year, including the enthronement.Guests include Britain’s Prince Charles, who along with Princess Diana attended Akihito’s enthronement ceremony, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon.Also attending are Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Myanmar leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will also likely attend, according to domestic media reports, but their names were not on a list issued by the government on Friday.A court banquet will begin at 7:20 p.m., attended by foreign dignitaries and representatives of Japan’s executive, legislative and judicial branches, and their spouses.Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, his Harvard-educated, ex-diplomat wife, will host a tea party for foreign royalty the following afternoon.Abe will then host a banquet for about 900 foreign leaders and other delegation members at Tokyo’s Hotel New Otani in the evening.To mark the enthronement, the government plans to grant pardons to about 550,000 people who committed petty crimes, such as traffic violations, and were fined.Those pardoned will have restrictions on their legal rights lifted. In Japan, those who are convicted and fined are banned from obtaining licences to become physicians or nurses for five years.The government has postponed a procession due after the enthronement ceremony as the country grapples with the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, which hit over the weekend, causing the deaths of least 78.Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako are now scheduled to ride in an open-top Toyota Century limousine through central Tokyo from 3:00 p.m. on Nov. 10.Some 120,000 people, many waving national flags, lined the route to cheer Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko as they passed by in a Rolls-Royce Corniche III after his enthronement.	5.491371746
TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Former champions Toyota will return to the world rally championship in 2017 with a Yaris car prepared in Germany, the Japanese manufacturer announced on Friday.“It’s like I’m reuniting with a long-lost love after 18 years,�� Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda, an amateur race driver, told a news conference in Tokyo on Friday.Toyota won four drivers�� and three manufacturers�� world titles in the 1990s before leaving the series as champions in 1999.They were also banned for a year in 1995 after their car was found to be fitted with an illegal turbo restrictor.The world championship currently has three works teams -- Volkswagen, Citroen and Hyundai -- along with non-factory Fords prepared by M-Sport.The Yaris hatchback, called Vitz in some markets, is sold in 64 countries. Toyota said the rally car had already completed a preliminary test programme on asphalt and gravel stages throughout Europe.Frenchman Eric Camilli, 27, will carry out the development programme with compatriot Stephane Sarrazin and Finland’s Sebastian Lindholm.Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, said it remained committed to Le Mans and the world endurance championship that it won last year.“To run two works motorsport programmes simultaneously is of course a challenge but we believe we have the expertise and determination to succeed,�� said Cologne-based Toyota Motorsport president Yoshiaki Kinoshita.The WRC promoter welcomed Toyota’s return as “marvellous news for the sport��.“Toyota has a long and distinguished history in motorsport, particularly in world rallying, and we’re delighted to welcome one of the automobile industry’s giants back to WRC,�� Oliver Ciesla said in a statement.“There is a clear link between World Rally Cars and the vehicles we drive in the street and that’s a powerful marketing tool,�� he added.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Tuesday it is recalling about 5,850 cars, most of them in the United States, for possible loss of steering control.The Japanese automaker said it is recalling about 5,650 Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon and Avalon Hybrid cars from model year 2014 in the United States because the left front suspension lower arm could separate from a ball joint and cause the loss of steering control, which could increase the risk of an accident. The rest of the recalled cars were sold in Canada and the Middle East, a spokeswoman said.Toyota said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related to the issue.The company said dealers will replace the suspension arm at no cost and notification of the recall will begin in early December.	6.311279558
PARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Ford, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Toyota led European car sales to a new low in January, kicking off 2013 with an 8.5 percent decline, the Association of European carmakers said on Tuesday.Registrations fell to 918,280 new cars, the Brussels-based industry body said in a statement, the slowest January since its records began in 1990.Ford, which is cutting back its European production capacity with three plant closures to stem regional losses, recorded a 26 percent sales plunge to 61,544 cars. Peugeot and Toyota posted the next biggest declines among major automakers, dropping 16 percent each.After falling to a 17-year low in 2012, European car demand is expected to contract further this year, squeezing mass-market brands still harder between excess capacity and cutthroat pricing. Most carmakers see the regional market shrinking between 3 and 5 percent in 2013.Hopes for a broader euro zone economic upturn have yet to percolate to the car industry.Germany in particular is weighing on the outlook. After resisting much of last year’s slump, Europe’s biggest car market is in sharp decline, extended by an 8.6 percent drop in January.Despite weak demand at home, Volkswagen increased its share of European sales. Its registrations fell 5.5 percent in January, a more modest decline than the market’s, as the premium Audi nameplate fell just 2.1 percent.Its two German luxury rivals proved even more resilient, with BMW brand sales rising 9.4 percent and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz gaining 4.7 percent.South Korea’s Kia also fared well, with registrations surging 7.7 percent, while affiliate Hyundai’s sales fell just 2.2 percent.Italy’s Fiat posted a 12.4 percent sales decline, despite a more modest 4 percent drop for the Italian carmaker’s namesake brand.The upscale Alfa Romeo marque, upon which Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne is building his recovery strategy for the group, saw its European sales collapse 37 percent in January.	1.364655425

If you tout Denny Hamlin as a favorite to win the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship this season, don’t expect the driver of the No. 11 Joe Gibbs racing Toyota to contradict you.“We certainly have a great shot,�� Hamlin said Saturday at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina, site of Sunday’s Bojangles�� Southern 500 (6 p.m. ET on NBCSN, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). “I like our chances each and every weekend against anyone.”Recent results back up that assertion. Hamlin picked up his fourth victory of the season Aug. 17 at Bristol Motor Speedway, where he passed Matt DiBenedetto with 11 laps left and pulled away for the win. Hamlin has accumulated 23 playoff points, tied for second in the series with Joe Gibbs racing teammate Martin Truex Jr. and six behind leader Kyle Busch, another teammate.“We won’t have as many points at Kyle, unless we win the next two races, but we’ll be close,�� Hamlin said. “Certainly, closer than we’ve ever been as far as playoff points are concerned. That’s obviously very crucial to get you past those first couple rounds, if you have a bad race.”Hamlin hasn’t had many bad races recently. He’s riding a string of six straight top-five finishes that includes victories at Pocono and Bristol.Consequently, winning the next two events isn’t that far-fetched, especially considering his record at Darlington, where Hamlin has two Cup victories and an average finishing position of 6.2 -- not to mention five wins and nine top fives in 11 NASCAR Xfinity starts.“I want to win as many races I can, especially after not winning any last year,�� Hamlin said. “We want to take advantage of every single opportunity we can to win, and certainly over the last eight weeks, when you look at what we consider our best finishing-position potential, it’s all been a string of ��1s.�� I think certainly we want to capitalize on every single one.”Missing postseason a blessing for Johnson?Sure, Jimmie Johnson wants to qualify for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoffs this year.And, certainly, he’d like to keep intact his unique streak of advancing to the NASCAR postseason every year there has been a postseason.Realistically, though, the seven-time series champion faces an uphill battle if he hopes to race for the title this year. In the throes of an 83-race winless streak, Johnson is 18th in the standings, 26 points behind Daniel Suarez in 16th and 24 behind Clint Bowyer in 17th.Johnson would have to pass both drivers in the next two races to claim the 16th and final playoff spot, provided there are no new winners among those behind him in the standings. That’s a tall order.Should Johnson’s enviable playoff streak end, however, there might be a silver lining. He and new crew chief Cliff Daniels would have 10 races to work on improvements for 2020, the final year of Johnson’s contract with Hendrick Motorsports.“It’s really about building this team and getting it right for the next year -- for the 2020 season and getting back to Victory Lane,�� Johnson said. “The goals kind of stay the same, but we all know the pressure is looming on us heavily right now to make the playoffs. If that pressure does go away, then I think we will be able to speed up the learning process amongst each other.“I hope it doesn’t go away, because that means we made the playoffs and have to stay alive in the playoffs. We’d much rather have this pressure and keep evolving as a team than have it go away.”Clearly, keeping the playoff streak alive is the preferable outcome, and the driver of the No. 48 Chevrolet hopes to make the next two races memorable.“It’s a story,�� Johnson said. “I get it. Believe me, I want to keep my playoff streak alive, and I want to be a factor in the playoffs. I want to know what the outcome is, but it’s not that I want to hurry up and get through it and have it go away. I want to race. I want to get out there and earn another victory and earn my way into these playoffs.“That’s what we’re all here for. So, my optimism again, comes from that I just know where this team is right now, and I know where it’s going. Unfortunately, we don’t have any more time left, but we’re going to finish up the year strong and that brings me a lot of excitement regardless of how the Playoffs unfold.”Newman: No regrets about Bristol battle with DiBenedettoWith roughly 40 laps left in the Aug. 17 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Bristol Motor Speedway, Matt DiBenedetto held a 1.6-second lead over second-place Denny Hamlin when DiBenedetto caught Ryan Newman’s No. 6 Ford, the last car on the lead lap.DiBenedetto struggled to overtake Newman, generally regarded as one of the toughest drivers in the series to pass. Contact between the two vehicles tightened the handling of DiBenedetto’s No. 95 Toyota, whose lead had shrunk to .8 seconds by the time he cleared Newman’s Mustang.With 11 laps left, Hamlin caught and passed DiBenedetto for the win, spoiling a Cinderella story for the driver who had been told by Leavine Family Racing earlier in the week that his option wouldn’t be picked up for 2020.As might be expected, Newman received his share of criticism on social media, even though he was locked in close battle for a playoff spot and was fighting to stay on the lead lap.“I think Kyle Busch would tell you the best, there’s always going to be haters,�� Newman said on Friday at Darlington Raceway. “I did what I needed to do to be competitive. I haven’t seen any replays. I don’t know exactly how he hit me twice in two separate straightaways in the right rear going down the straightaway.“If I pinched him, or if he didn’t give himself enough room or what, but in the end there was nothing intentional by me.

LONDON (Reuters) - A cast of top drivers will race in a virtual 24 Hours of Le Mans in June but the postponed real-life version must also happen this year, even if without spectators, World Endurance Championship (WEC) boss Gerard Neveu said on Monday.The race at the Sarthe circuit in north-west France, now in its 88th edition, is the crowning glory of the WEC season and was attended by 250,000 people in 2019 with a large number coming from Britain.It has been rescheduled from June 13-14 to Sept 19-20 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but whether it will be held on those dates, and with a crowd, remains an open question.“Will it be a regular event or an event behind closed doors? It’s impossible to say now,�� Neveu told Reuters in a Zoom interview.“When you organise Le Mans, you want to organise Le Mans with the public because Le Mans is more than the race. It is really a celebration that you share with a lot of people. It’s a very special event.“It would be very frustrating if we have to do it behind closed doors.”The WEC chief executive said the key thing was to guarantee the race, which is run by the Automobile Club de L’Ouest who set the dates, would happen because many teams had built their business model around it.“If we cannot organise this race we will considerably affect and damage the business model and stability of many teams, many competitors,�� he said.“I am not speaking about the manufacturers, I think they have the capacity to jump from one year to another. But for the majority of the private teams it will be seriously a big problem.”The new coronavirus has also led to the restructuring of the WEC season, which will now start in March next year and end in November instead of September to June with Le Mans as the showcase finale.That will also allow coordination with the North American IMSA endurance season.“The super-season is a model that worked once because it was 16 months, it was very special,�� said Neveu of a 2018-19 championship that featured Le Mans twice.“It was following the sudden departure of Audi and Porsche in LMP1 (the top category). But now we are not facing the same situation. We have the Le Mans Hypercar (category) arriving in March and ready for next year.”Neveu said the main things the competing teams would be looking for in the coming months were stability and visibility.“It looks crystal clear that the target for everyone in coming months will be to save budget and spend the minimum money.”The esports event announced last week is also attracting plenty of interest.Neveu said the grid was already full, with a reserve list needed.“We will be able to do something very different from the real (race),�� he said.“The question is not to compare, it’s just to replace the empty box on the 13th and 14th of June by a real celebration of the Le Mans 24 with a very special race.“We already know that we will have Formula One, Formula E, Formula Two, sportscars, professional racers and top sim racers,�� he added.The event will be broadcast around the world, with plans also for a virtual concert in the night and VIPs visiting the virtual paddock.“It’s a fully dedicated event to celebrate Le Mans,�� said Neveu. “Professional teams will engage the drivers and manage the drivers.“Some will have the same simulator for four drivers in the same place, some others will manage the four drivers in different places all around the world.“I know that Toyota have drivers in Argentina, some others in Europe or New Zealand, but they will manage that very well.��	9.220098122
Aug 24 (Reuters) - Nikkei* Toyota Motor expects to lower its wholesale steel prices by around 5,000 yen ($45) in the October-March period- Nikkei Source text: s.nikkei.com/2woOIxz Further company coverage:	7.797184103
BEIJING/MUMBAI, July 14 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co takes the veil off the first car in its resurrected Datsun brand in New Delhi on Monday - a sub-400,000-rupee ($6,700) hatchback that is part of a foray by the Japanese auto maker into cheap cars for emerging markets.With the Datsun hatchback and other Datsun models to follow over the next three years - one of which could be priced as low as $4,000 (240,000 rupees) if Nissan can meet its aggressive manufacturing cost objectives - Nissan is treading ever so closer to the ultra-low-cost car market.That market in India is now famously occupied by the Tata Nano, a barebones car that retails for between 150,000 and 220,000 rupees.“We try to keep the price positioning for Datsun competitive, so that products are appealing�� to the lower half of the auto market in India where Nissan has few products competing today, Nissan’s programme director for Datsun, Ashwani Gupta, told Reuters in an interview.It is a move that has been generally resisted so far by other global auto giants, such as Toyota Motor Corp., out of concern a scruffy, ultra-cheap car model could tarnish their high-value brands.Top Toyota executives, including current chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, rejected a chief engineer’s design for a low-cost emerging market car several years ago, saying it was too cheap to be called a Toyota, an engineering executive said.The car has since undergone some design iterations and was finally launched in India in 2010 as the Toyota Etios sedan, which starts at 545,000 rupees. A hatchback version of the car, launched in 2011, starts at about 450,000 rupees.Since Nissan plans to market Datsun cars in India through its existing Nissan-branded dealerships, Datsun could expose the Japanese auto maker to similar risks, though executives downplay the possibility.They say use of a separate brand name should effectively shield Nissan’s brand image. Datsun, which Nissan once used for its cars outside Japan, has a history dating back to the 1930s.“We’re serving different customers�� with Datsun, said Tatjana Natarova, a Datsun spokeswoman. “That’s why we came up with a different brand.”To make Datsun cars affordable, Nissan has been aiming to reduce manufacturing costs to $3,000 to $5,000 per vehicle. The first car is due for a launch in India early next year and Gupta said the company has partially achieved the cost goals.Still, as price-competitive as that may be, it will face formidable competition from Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor Co, which together control two-thirds of India’s passenger car market, excluding SUVs and vans.Maruti has about 1,200 retail stores in India, while Hyundai operates a network of more than 350 stores. Nissan, by contrast, has only about 100 dealers, though it says it plans to triple the number of its stores to 300 by March 2017.Nissan said last year it would revive the Datsun name as a marquee for emerging markets, starting with India, Russia and Indonesia. Eventually, it wants to expand into Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.To make the new name stick, Nissan does not plan to stop with a sub-400,000-rupee car. It plans to expand the Datsun brand’s appeal by following its first car with a second model by the end of next year and a third vehicle by 2016.Nissan is still trying to meet the goal of producing a Datsun car for as little as $3,000 per vehicle, said an executive speaking on condition of anonymity.“If we met that, there would be a good possibility we could offer the car for $4,000 on the retail market,�� the executive said.That is not as cheap as the Nano, but Nissan is not aiming to compete head-on with the Nano any way, the executive said.By the year ending March 2017, Nissan wants to capture 10 percent of India’s overall passenger vehicle market that includes sedans, sport-utility vehicles and vans. Nissan had a market share of less than 1 percent as of May, data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers shows.By then, Datsun aims to generate one third to a half of overall sales in India, which bought 2.7 million passenger vehicles in the year ended March 2013, Gupta said.To achieve low manufacturing costs, the Datsun product team designed and engineered cars so that “nearly all�� the components needed to build them could be procured within India, Gupta said.India has a relatively limited auto parts supply base so procuring almost all the necessary components locally poses a challenge. Gupta said though that Nissan aims to pull off the feat not only in India, but in Indonesia and Russia as well.Gupta said Datsun cars would be stripped of features and functions that do not offer “value�� to customers in markets they target to make cars affordable.Nissan thus will likely avoid developing new technology. Instead, it will use tried technology, in particular vehicle underpinnings, engines and transmissions, which are costly to develop. It is also likely to pare down expensive features such as power-windows, navigation systems, and extra safety airbags. (Editing by Neil Fullick)	0.4319654428
TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks slipped on Wednesday morning as investors were cautious after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran.The focus locally was on major corporate earnings including from Toyota Motor, which will be released during trading hours for the first time. SoftBank and Mitsubishi Motors will announce their results after the market close.The Nikkei fell 0.5 percent to 22,399.00 in midmorning trade.Trump’s move raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. The news lifted mining stocks such as Inpex Corp and Japan Drilling by 2.3 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.“The short-term impact on the stock market may be limited, but worries over a mid-to-long term impact could lead to a risk-off stance from investors,�� said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.“If oil prices stay high, costs will rise and that will trigger price increase.”Toyota’s full-year result is scheduled to be released at GMT 0425, followed by a press conference. President Akio Toyoda will then talk about the firm’s long-term strategy from 0530GMT.Another potentially market-moving event could be Takeda Pharmaceutical CEO Christopher Weber’s press conference at 0300GMT, the day after it agreed to buy Shire for $62 billion.The M&amp;A news dented the pharmaceutical sector, which tumbled 2.4 percent and was the worst sectoral performer on the board, with traders citing passive investors�� selling. Investors will have to reduce weighting of other drugmakers to invest in Takeda, whose market capitalization has ballooned, traders said.Otsuka Holdings tumbled 4.2 percent, Daiichi Sankyo declined 3.5 percent and Eisai Co shed 1.4 percent.Elsewhere, Asahi Group Holdings soared 7.5 percent after its January-March net profit jumped 430 percent to 14.8 billion yen.The broader Topix dropped 0.5 percent to 1,770.77.

* 60 pct of Nissan cars to be in parts-sharing plan in 2016* Says taking measures to avoid quality problems* China sales improving daily despite recent Japan-China rowYOKOHAMA, Japan, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co plans to ramp up its programme of using the same parts in different models, as Japanese automakers try to catch up with rivals like Germany’s Volkswagen AG in a key money-saving strategy.Nissan plans to produce 60 percent of vehicles under its so-called Common Module Family (CMF) in 2016, up from 12 percent in 2013 when the first series of cars under the plan will roll out, Senior Vice President Yasuhiro Yamauchi told reporters on Monday.Using common parts can increase the risk of a big product recall, as a single faulty part could lead to pulling back a large number of cars. But Nissan said it was taking steps to avoid quality problems and supply chain glitches.“Our basic strategy is to avoid concentration of parts production at a single location, as well as by a single supplier,�� Hiroto Saikawa, Executive Vice President of Nissan, told reporters at the firm’s headquarters in Yokohama, Japan.A recent recall by Toyota was a reminder of the risks. The firm last week said it was recalling 7.4 million vehicles globally over a faulty power window switch produced by one supplier.Under the CMF, Nissan will double the use of common parts in its next generation cars to 80 percent.Toyota is also planning to build more cars using common parts.These programmes follow in the footsteps of Volkswagen, whose common-parts drive aims to produce 3.5 million small- and mid-sized cars around 20 percent more cheaply, and shorten assembly by 30 percent.Saikawa also said Nissan’s sales in China are improving day by day after they plummeted 34.6 percent in September from a year earlier, largely due to an upsurge of anti-Japanese sentiment sparked by a row over disputed islands.Nissan has the highest exposure to China among Japanese carmakers. Nissan’s sales in the world’s biggest auto market accounted for about 27 percent of its total sales in 2011.	3.802379721
TOKYO (Reuters) - Five Japanese automakers including Suzuki Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp on Friday said they would each invest 2% in the on-demand, self-driving car service venture set up by SoftBank Corp and Toyota Motor Corp.Suzuki, Mazda, Subaru Corp, Isuzu Motors Ltd and Toyota’s compact car unit Daihatsu will each invest 57.1 million yen ($530,620) in the venture - dubbed Monet - in return for a 2% stake, the companies said in a statement.SoftBank and Toyota will each retain their 35% stakes in the company, which is now capitalized at $26.6 million. The latest investors join Honda Motor Co Ltd and Hino Motors Ltd, Toyota’s truck-making operations, which each own 10% stakes.Launched in October, the venture plans to roll out on-demand bus and car services in Japan in the next year, and a services platform for electric vehicles in the country as early as 2023 based on Toyota’s boxy “e-palette�� multi-purpose vehicle.Monet is building up members as it joins the ride-sharing sphere which is dominated by startups such as Uber Technologies Inc, Didi Chuxing and Lyft Inc, as traditional automakers band together to compete in an industry which is placing growing emphasis on offering vehicle services rather than selling cars to individual drivers.Automakers are increasingly joining forces with technology companies as well as each other as they grapple with the massive investment and software expertise required to develop these new services for which demand has yet to be tested.The new investment will see Suzuki, Mazda and Subaru deepen their partnership with Toyota, as they have already agreed to tap the R&amp;D firepower of Japan’s biggest automaker for electric cars and other future vehicle technologies.Friday’s announcement comes after Monet’s chief executive told Reuters earlier this month it was planning to expand its investor base and start operating in Southeast Asia next year.($1 = 107.6100 yen)	6.242438906
DETROIT (Reuters) - An influential consumer magazine on Monday called on Toyota Motor Corp to recall about 177,500 older Camry hybrid sedans to address potential power brake defects.Consumer Reports, which many consumers use when studying what vehicles to buy, said the Japanese automaker’s decision to call for a service campaign or a warranty extension on two different problems covering cars from model years 2007 to 2011 does not go far enough. Under a service campaign, an automaker repairs cars as they are brought back to dealers by consumers.“Consumer Reports believes that Toyota should recall these cars,�� the magazine said. “What’s at issue here is a series of acknowledged defects in a crucial safety system.“A recall is more comprehensive and widely published than a mere service campaign, and owners don’t have to wait for a problem to happen before qualifying for the repair,�� Consumer Reports added. “Besides that, unlike extended warranties, recalls don’t expire and are performed proactively.”Toyota spokesman John Hanson said in an email statement that the automaker was working with the U.S. safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on a probe related to the issue.“We believe our actions to address this issue are appropriate, and we are continuing to cooperate with NHTSA in its investigation,�� he said.Consumer reports said Toyota’s decisions were prompted partly by consumer complaints filed with NHTSA. The complaints over the last several years have covered loss of braking performance, increased effort to press the brake pedal and other difficulties, the magazine said.NHTSA opened a “preliminary evaluation�� probe into an estimated 30,000 Camry hybrid sedans from model years 2007 and 2008 after receiving 59 complaints of intermittent loss of assisted braking, resulting in increased stopping distances.NHTSA said it continues to evaluate all data as part of the investigation and will take action as needed.A preliminary evaluation is the first step in a process that can lead to a recall if regulators determine a manufacturer needs to address a safety problem.Consumer Reports, which pointed out Toyota’s service campaign and extended warranty both broadened the scope of the potentially affected vehicles, said its review for the two model years NHTSA cited found power-brake complaints had risen to 269, with 14 crashes and five injuries.In the service campaign, a problem is potentially caused by a clogged brake-fluid reservoir filter and “front-brake assist could be temporarily lost,�� according to a Toyota notice to dealers. Instead of a recall, Toyota will alert owners to the campaign to install a new brake reservoir tank at no cost between now and June 30, 2017.In the other case, Toyota is extending warranty coverage of the anti-lock brake system’s brake actuator from the standard three years or 36,000 miles, to 10 years or 150,000 miles, according to a separate dealer notice. Remedies could include a new actuator or reprogramming of the skid control electronic control unit.	-5.100348316
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel will hold a hearing Tuesday on autonomous vehicles as lawmakers try to hammer out legislation to advance self-driving cars.An Energy and Commerce subcommittee overseeing automotive issues will hear from officials of trade groups representing automakers and tech companies, as well as safety advocates and a San Francisco transit official.Congress has worked for four years on legislation that would remove regulatory barriers but has not reached agreement. Last summer, a bipartisan group of lawmakers released sections of a draft self-driving car bill for discussion.The bills that have been under consideration would clear the way for automakers and tech firms to deploy tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles without human controls on U.S. roads if they could demonstrate the vehicles were at least as safe as human-driven vehicles. They would also bar states from setting performance standards for self-driving cars.“Manufacturers of autonomous vehicles and semi-autonomous technologies are working to transform the way we travel, and we must ensure that these technologies are rigorously tested and properly deployed with necessary safety oversight and accountability,�� said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone and Representative Jan Schakowsky, the subcommittee chair.The committee confirmed witnesses will include John Bozzella, who heads an auto trade association representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and others; Gary Shapiro, who heads the Consumer Technology Association, and Jeff Tumlin, director of transportation at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Significant self-driving car testing is occurring in San Francisco and the surrounding area.One key hurdle to approval has been concerns raised by trial lawyers that legislation could preempt lawsuits against self-driving cars that did not perform properly.Daniel Hinkle, who is state affairs counsel at the American Association of Justice, which represents plaintiffs attorneys, will testify.On Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave permission for autonomous vehicle startup Nuro Inc to deploy up to 5,000 low-speed electric delivery vehicles without human controls like mirrors, the first time the agency temporarily waived safety rules to allow deployment of self-driving vehicles.Supporters of legislation say Congress must act because the existing rules assume a human driver is in control, hindering widescale deployment.After an Uber test vehicle was involved in the first death caused by a self-driving car, the National Transportation Safety Board urged NHTSA to require testing operators of self-driving vehicles to submit a safety self-assessment.	-13.08748584
BUENOS AIRES, April 8 (Reuters) - Argentina’s auto production will hold steady or drop slightly this year as sales are hit by the steep recession in main trading partner Brazil, the ADEFA association of vehicle makers said on Friday.“The external situation will remain complicated,�� the president of ADEFA, Enrique Alemany, said in a statement published online. “There are no prospects for a Brazilian recovery.”Brazil is the No. 1 buyer of Argentine car exports.Alemany underscored measures taken by Argentina’s new, business-friendly government to improve the sector’s competitiveness such as cutting taxes on new cars and letting the peso float, resulting in a weaker and more competitive exchange rate.President Mauricio Macri won election last year on promises to reboot Argentina’s ailing economy.Auto production in the first quarter of 2016 dropped 18.1 percent on the year to 98,168 units, according to ADEFA.Vehicle production slumped 12 percent in 2015.Leading automakers operating in Argentina include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co Ltd , Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG, Peugeot SA and Renault SA.	4.246672762

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan cut its economic assessment for three of the country’s nine regions on Wednesday but remained cautiously optimistic that domestic demand could help offset a slowdown in exports and manufacturing.All of the regions kept their assessment on private consumption unchanged, despite fluctuations in spending patterns around the Oct. 1 sales tax hike, likely backing the BOJ’s rosy view that solid domestic demand will offset external headwinds.The BOJ’s optimism is likely to allow it to justify keeping monetary policy steady for the time being.“All nine regions reported that their economies were either expanding or recovering,�� the central bank said in the regional report. “Domestic demand continued on an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating in both the corporate and household sectors.”The downgrades for the northern region of Hokuriku, the central region of Tokai - home to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T - and the western area of Chugoku were due to weak exports and output caused by the global slowdown, which has slowed their rate of expansion.Still, Tokiko Shimizu, the Nagoya branch manager overseeing the Tokai region, said positive signs were emerging, while the impact of the sales tax hike will be limited.Demand for machine tools from the United States and China appeared to be bottoming out, adjustments in car output and inventories in China were making steady progress, and production of IT-related goods was recovering, she said.“A moderate expansion will continue in the Tokai region for the time being, but the economy will be getting on a firmer footing as factors weighing on output and exports taper from now on,�� she told reporters after the BOJ branch managers�� meeting.The central bank is likely to slightly revise up its economic forecasts for this fiscal year to March at its policy review next week, boosted by the government’s latest spending package, sources told Reuters.The more optimistic outlook comes from an improvement in domestic demand due to stronger corporate investment, solid household income and employment, and an expected boost from public spending.The BOJ’s nine-member board will also review its current forecasts for core consumer inflation to hit 1.1% in fiscal 2020 and to accelerate to 1.5% the following year, although big changes to these projections are seen as unlikely.Projections of tame inflation should further back market expectations that the BOJ will keep monetary policy ultra-loose to achieve its elusive 2% price goal.At the branch managers�� meeting, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda held to the BOJ’s view that the Japanese economy will see moderate growth despite weak exports and output, hit by the global slowdown and natural disasters at home.Kuroda dropped few hints on what steps the central bank might take next, while repeating his readiness to ease further as needed to achieve the inflation target.Kuroda also said consumer inflation, which is hovering around 0.5%, would accelerate toward 2%, even though it could be affected for the time being by falling oil prices.“We will adjust policy as necessary to maintain momentum towards our price stability target while examining risks,�� he said. “We will not hesitate to take additional easing steps if risks heighten to an extent that the momentum towards the price target is undermined.��	0.5668771527
SYDNEY, June 25 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks ended at a more than one-week low on Thursday, tracking losses on Wall Street, as rising coronavirus cases in the United States and many other countries dented hopes of a quick global economic recovery.The benchmark Nikkei average fell 1.2% to 22,259.79, its lowest closing level since June 15.Highly cyclical air transport, non-ferrous metals and iron and steel were among the worst performing sectors on the main bourse.Overnight, Wall Street’s three major indexes suffered their biggest daily percentage drop in almost two weeks as a surge in coronavirus cases intensified fears of another round of government lockdowns and worsening economic damage.E-mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 index were last quoted down 0.5% in late Asian trade.The broader Topix shed 1.2% to 1,561.85, its lowest closing since June 15, with all but one of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo exchange finishing lower.Blue-chip exporters led the declines, with Toyota Motor Corp shedding 2.6%, while Panasonic Corp and Nikon Corp lost 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively.SoftBank Group Corp slipped 0.5% as its founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son on Thursday told shareholders not to expect dividends for some time while share buyback plan is in progress.Bucking the overall weakness, Olympus Corp surged 11.2% to hit a four-month high after the company said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell its historic but unprofitable camera business to Japan Industrial Partners Inc.Analysts said the decision came as a positive surprise.NEC Corp advanced 2.4% after the company said on Thursday it would discuss forming a capital alliance with telecommunications company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) at its board meeting later in the day.

TOKYO, April 9 (Reuters) - Tokyoites will get a chance to zip around town on Toyota Motor Corp’s three-wheeled electric car-cum-motorbike from Friday, in a trial aimed at crafting a global business model to reduce gridlock and pollution.The world’s top-selling automaker will partner Japanese car-sharing service operator Park24 Co Ltd for a six-month experiment leasing the i-Road concept vehicle, with a view to setting up a green car-sharing business akin to Daimler AG’s car2go service.The pint-sized i-Road has two front wheels that move up and down independently of each other, allowing it to lean like a motorcycle but retain the stability of a car. Toyota has not yet decided whether to mass-produce it.“Our concept was to offer something that’s both fun and convenient for city driving,�� i-Road chief engineer Akihiro Yanaka told Reuters.Devising smarter ways to get around - known in the industry as “smart mobility�� - looks set to become a new battleground for automakers as urbanisation grows, pollution worsens, and more cars clog up cities in emerging markets.Germany’s Daimler has taken the lead with car2go, where its 1 million-plus members in 30 European and North American cities use a mobile app to reserve the tiny Smart Fortwo car, many of which are zero-emission. Drivers pay by the minute and can drop the car off at various spots around town.Ford Motor Co in January announced the Ford Smart Mobility initiative that would involve various types of trials around the world including a car-sharing service in London.Toyota also has car-sharing experiments underway in its namesake city as well as in France’s Grenoble, but Tokyo would be its first in a major metropolis, which it says would benefit most from the i-Road.“Data shows that about 70 percent of cars in big cities are occupied by one person, with most travelling less than 10 km (6.2 miles),�� said Toshiya Hayata, group manager of Toyota’s Smart Community department. “That means the mode of transportation doesn’t have to be a car.”In the upcoming trial, users can lease one of five i-Roads from the upmarket Ginza shopping district for 412 yen ($3) per 15 minutes, dropping it off at any of five spots in the capital.To turn the trial into a viable business, Toyota said it would need to slash costs both for the i-Road and for operating a car-sharing network.“But Daimler doesn’t have anything smaller than the Smart,�� Yanaka said. “If we can make it work, the i-Road could have an advantage.�� ($1 = 120.1500 yen) (Editing by Christopher Cushing)	-1.758273176
"DETROIT (Reuters) - Scion, Toyota Motor Co's 7203.T youth-oriented brand, is targeting an older, more mainstream audience as ""millennials"" delay car purchases, raising the possibility of weaker-than-expected sales growth this year.“Millennials are in fact buying cars, they have just waited longer to buy cars because they’ve come out of college with more financial debt than any other generation, so their decision making around durable goods is being delayed,�� said Andrew Gilleland, who took over as vice president of Scion in September.He said the brand expected to sell 70,000 to 80,000 cars this year, acknowledging the risk that sales may come up short of a previous forecast of 80,000.Scion is Toyota’s solution-in-progress to an ongoing slide in car ownership among young drivers, who are increasingly turning to ride-hailing apps and car-sharing services as an alternative to owning cars.Launched in 2003, the U.S. brand initially targeted drivers around the 18-35 age group, selling a small range of well-equipped, entry-level Toyota-made cars to millennials in hopes that they will graduate to the Toyota brand in the future.Gilleland said roughly half of all Scion buyers were under 35.They were no longer interested in quirky models including the compact xB that drove sales in the brand’s early years, and were now interested in the iM four-door hatchback and iA four-door sedan.“The customer is now very different from the people who were buying the xB, who wanted to stand out from the crowd,�� Gilleland said. “We’ve found that consumers are looking for something more mainstream now.”To win over a market in tune with hip hop, heavy metal and skateboarding, Scion has supplemented traditional car advertising with its own record label, online TV series and sponsored music events as it has tried to sculpt an image of an underground lifestyle brand.But the strategy has been slow to generate lasting sales growth. Annual sales fell 3.2 percent to around 56,000 vehicles in 2015, marking a fifth consecutive year of decline, and are less than a third what they were in 2006, when sales peaked around 173,000.Scion is counting on its first crossover model, the C-HR, which goes on sale in early 2017, as the brand bets on a general boom in U.S. demand for larger vehicles to lift sales to 100,000 next year."	-9.280842614
* Toyota sold 0.9 mln cars in China last yr, expects to hit 1 mln this yr* Expects China car sales to make up 15 pct of its global sales by 2015 (Adds more comments from executive)CHENGDU, China, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp aims to sell up to 1.8 million cars annually in China by 2015, up from about 900,000 cars it sold in the world’s biggest auto market last year, a senior executive said on Thursday.Executive vice president Atsushi Niimi, speaking at an auto conference in the southwestern city of Chengdu, said the Japanese car maker’s target this year is to sell 1 million cars in China.Niimi’s comments come after the Japanese car maker posted a second consecutive monthly fall in China sales in August, which company spokesman Takanori Yokoi said was due to a high base from last year.That 1 million level this year should account for about 12 percent of Toyota’s anticipated overall global sales this year.The company wants to push that ratio to 15 percent by 2015, Niimi said. That should translate into China-market sales of 1.5 million to 1.8 million cars by 2015, he added.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Friday it planned to build pickup trucks and possibly SUVs at a new plant in Mexico, a move that followed threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to penalize the company if it built small cars south of the border.Toyota initially planned to produce Corolla sedans at the plant it is building in the central state of Guanajuato but will now switch production of the small cars and a new Mazda SUV crossover to a new assembly plant planned for the United States.Trump threatened in January to impose a hefty fee on the world’s largest automaker if it built Corollas for the U.S. market in Mexico.Toyota de Mexico spokesman Luis Lozano said the global auto maker would study producing SUVs in Guanajuato, in addition to the Tacoma truck model.“We’re going to concentrate only on pickups at the beginning and are studying the potential for SUVs in the future,�� he said. Trucks and SUVs represented some 65 percent of the North American market, Lozano said.The decision came as Toyota planned to take a 5 percent share of smaller Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T as part of an alliance that will see the two build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant and work together on electric vehicles.A move to produce SUVs in Guanajuato would mark a continuation of a “burgeoning trend�� of Mexican manufacturing meeting quality standards needed to produce more expensive vehicles, said Christopher Wilson of the Woodrow Wilson International Center.“Instead of building lower value cars that generally offer smaller margins in Mexico and keeping high-value SUV and luxury model production in the U.S., they are moving in the opposite direction,�� said Wilson, deputy director of the think tank’s Mexico institute.“The moves by Toyota seem to be designed to reduce political pressure on the company from President Trump,�� he added.Toyota’s Lozano told a Mexico radio station later on Friday he expected the company’s level of investment in the region to remain similar despite the shift in plans.“The investment that we calculated when we announced the decision to make a plant for Corolla was for $1 billion dollars,�� he said.“At present, we don’t have a final figure for what this change means for our assessments. Up to now, it seems it won’t vary substantially,�� Lozano said.	-0.4468588452
NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Credit Corp , the lending arm of Toyota Motors Corp, could face an enforcement action from U.S. authorities over its pricing of auto loans through dealerships and could be forced to reimburse borrowers or pay a fine, the company said late Friday.On Nov. 25, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sent a letter to Toyota Motor Credit, saying that its auto lending practices “resulted in discriminatory pricing of loans to certain borrowers in contravention of applicable laws,�� the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Unless Toyota Motor Credit agrees to a resolution with the agencies voluntarily, which would include “monetary relief�� in addition to changes to its loan pricing policies, the Justice Department and the CFPB were prepared to bring an enforcement action, the filing said.Toyota Motor Credit added it would work with the agencies to reach a resolution.A spokesman for the CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In December 2013, Ally Financial Inc was forced to pay $98 million to resolve similar discriminatory loan pricing charges from the Justice Department and the CFPB.

March 26 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp plan to launch fuel-cell vehicles in the consumer market in 2015, with each producing about 1,000 eco-friendly cars a year, the Nikkei newspaper reported.The automakers now offer fuel-cell cars on lease, with users centering on municipalities and businesses, the daily said.Initial prices of these zero-emission vehicles, which cover longer distances than electric cars, will set below 10 million yen ($97,700), the Nikkei said.Honda is developing a sedan that it plans to roll out as early as November 2015, which will be able to travel about 500 kilometer on a single charge -- twice the range of an electric vehicle, the Nikkei reported.Honda intends to churn out 5,000 units over five years, selling them in Japan, the United States and Europe, the daily said.Toyota, the global leader in hybrid vehicles, intends to release a sedan in Japan, the United States and Europe in 2015, the Nikkei said, adding that by 2020, the automaker aims to lift annual output to tens of thousands of units.Toyota hopes to cut prices to between 3-5 million yen ($29,300-$48,900) in the 2020s, the Nikkei said, quoting an unnamed development staffer.Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of rival Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co, said in November carmakers would face obstacles in their plans to launch fuel-cell car sales over the next few years.

NEW YORK, May 22 (Reuters) - Toyota Research Institute, a wholly owned unit of Toyota Motor North America, said on Monday it has teamed up with MIT Media lab and five other companies to explore blockchain technology for the development of driverless cars.The project would enable businesses and consumers to securely share data on testing and driving as well as the sharing and usage of such cars to help set insurance rates, Toyota said in a statement.The database would use blockchain, a public online ledger of transactions that first became well known as the software underpinning bitcoin, the first digital currency.The growing use of computing power in vehicles is paving the way for self-driving cars, creating new rivalries and business opportunities for technology companies and automakers.“Hundreds of billions of miles of human driving data may be needed to develop safe and reliable autonomous vehicles,�� said Chris Ballinger, Toyota Research Institute’s director of mobility services and chief financial officer.“Blockchains and distributed ledgers may enable pooling data from vehicle owners, fleet managers, and manufacturers to shorten the time for reaching this goal.”Aside from MIT Media Lab, which is part of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, partners in the project include Berlin-based Bigchain DB, which is building the database. Oaken Innovations, based in Dallas and Toronto, is developing an application for car-sharing and payments, and Israeli startup Commuterz is creating car-pooling software.Toyota is also using blockchain to lower car insurance rates. By allowing a vehicle’s sensors to collect driving data and store in a blockchain, car owners may be eligible for lower insurance costs by giving their insurance companies increased transparency to reduce fraud.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Asian rivals Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Kia Motors 000270.KS unveiled concept sports cars this week that appear to target different demographics but share a common goal to add some sizzle to their brands.Toyota said the FT-1, a muscular-looking coupe unveiled Monday at the Detroit auto show, would deliver the type of heart-pumping performance CEO Akio Toyoda has complained is lacking in its fleet of reliable but predictably designed cars.Toyota said it was not sure whether it would take the car into production and did not disclose specifications. But analysts believe it is plotting a return to the segment after discontinuing the Supra more than a decade ago, and that it will likely produce a high-performance model catering to a well-heeled clientele.Kia, meanwhile, appears to have a younger client in mind with its 315-horsepower GT4 Stinger, which also had its debut at the auto show. It cited the Mazda MX5 and Scion FR-S - a Toyota offshoot brand focused on young customers - as possible competitors down the road.“I don’t see this concept competing with Porsche or Ferrari or Lamborghini or something. There are other mass market brands which offer sporty cars,�� Tom Kearns, Kia’s chief U.S. designer, told Reuters.Toyota, the world's largest automaker, and Kia, a much smaller South Korean affiliate of Hyundai Motors 005380.KS, are in vastly different stages of their development. But both see a sports car as a way to invigorate their brands.For Toyota launching a high-performance vehicle would bring an excitement into their line-up that has been largely missing since it called it quits on the Supra in the U.S. market in 1998, said Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell.“It has been accused of very boring, appliance-like cars. I think they need to do something to shake it up,�� Caldwell said, adding that she believes it should revive the Supra brand. “Older people remember it, they like it.”While Kia doesn’t have any track record in sports cars to build on, it could have success if it is priced under $25,000 - putting it in the same price range as the youth-focused FR-S, Caldwell said. She reckons Toyota might look to compete at a higher price point, somewhere between the FR-S and a Porsche.Both companies seemed resigned to forgo the pursuit of big profit margins in return for the elusive “halo effect�� a high-performance or trend-setting car can generate.Jim Lentz, head of Toyota’s North American operations, said Toyota has had good results with that strategy in the past, such as with the retro style FJ Cruiser SUV. But with sports cars demand can disappear quickly after an initial spurt, he warned.“Not to say that people don’t do sports cars because of the halo effect it has for brands. But in terms of the business of selling cars and making money on cars, sports cars don’t make a lot of sense,�� Lentz said.Hank Lee, vice chairman of Kia Motors, told reporters the sports car concept is part of its efforts to launch another attention-grabbing vehicle after its success with the Soul box car. He said it would decide whether to produce the GT4 Stinger after evaluating consumer response.The GT4 Stinger, which features Kia’s signature front grille, vertical LED headlights and a swooping roofline, is the next logical step in the company’s development in the U.S. market, Kearns said.While over the years Kia has transformed its image from a maker of low-priced cars, it needs more excitement to drive traffic to their showrooms, even if it means sacrificing some profits on producing a sports car, Kearns said.`“Even if you don’t make a huge amount of money, it doesn’t mean that it is a failure because the way it changes your image, and attracts a different type of customers that we don’t have now,�� he said.	-3.599229932

LONDON (Reuters) - British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt will on Monday seek to reassure Japanese carmaker Toyota that the government is focused on avoiding a no-deal exit from the European Union and ensuring tariff-tree trade between Britain and the EU.Hunt will meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Toyota representatives during a visit to Japan that his office said would give him chance to explain the latest Brexit developments.“The UK has always been an outward-looking, global power. That cannot change after Brexit. I look forward to our relationship with Japan getting even closer in the years after we leave the EU,�� Hunt said in a statement before the meetings.The statement said he would discuss Toyota’s recently announced plans to build a new car with Suzuki in Britain and “reassure them that UK Government is focussed on avoiding a no-deal Brexit and on agreeing a deal which that will ensure tariff-free frictionless trade between the EU and the UK��.Hunt will also meet telecommunications firm NTT DoCoMo.	-1.090432073

TAIZHOU, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese carmaker Geely plans to use a platform developed with input from Volvo to build new models in Malaysia for its partly owned Proton brand, a strategy that shows how it aims to accelerate its push to become China’s first global auto giant.The yet-to-be-finalised plans for Proton are just one strand of a Geely project to revamp factories at home and abroad using joint platforms it has been perfecting with Volvo since 2013. Geely bought the Swedish brand 10 years ago for $1.8 billion - a deal that raised its international profile and sent shockwaves through the global auto trade.Senior Geely officials and engineers told Reuters that a project dubbed Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) will allow them to develop, design and build different types of compact cars with similar mechanical layout faster than before - and at lower cost.They said CMA, along with a platform for smaller cars known as B-segment Modular Architecture (BMA) that Geely plans to roll out for Proton, allow them to harness the Swedish automaker’s technologies and Geely’s capabilities in cost control, supply chain management and local production.“CMA will be the core of Geely’s future architecture design ... We learn technologies and build up talents through developing it,�� said Li Li, vice president at Geely Automobile Research Institute, confirming the Proton plan during an interview in Ningbo, south of Shanghai. Li declined to disclose details of general investment, financial targets or a timetable for expansion plans.From its lowly foundation in 1986 in Taizhou on the east coast as a maker of refrigerator parts, Geely has grown into one of the biggest players in China, the world’s largest auto market accounting for nearly one in every three passenger cars sold around the planet. Geely now sells more than 2 million cars a year across all brands, ranking it not far from the world’s top 10 automakers by unit sales.The CMA platform in particular will allow Geely and Volvo to design vehicles more quickly and cost-effectively, Li said, providing a technological springboard towards a higher market share at a time when the auto industry must embrace a future featuring electric and autonomously driven transport.(Graphic: Pedal to the metal: Geely's car sales 2010-2020, )Like Geely - an anglicisation of the Chinese word for 'lucky' - domestic peers Great Wall Motor 601633.SS and GAC 601238.SS have branched out with their own versions of vehicle platforms, harbouring greater ambitions for selling cars in major Western markets.But grand plans have previously been delayed, or simply cancelled, amid a lack of practical preparedness, analysts have said, against a backdrop of years of trade tensions between China and the United States that have roiled the global economy. At the same time, attention has been diverted to deal with stalling sales at home as the pace of China’s growth has slowed.In its pursuit of global automaker status, Hangzhou-based Geely is now holding talks to merge the Volvo Cars business with its Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile 0175.HK - worth about $22 billion by market value, bigger then famed industry names like Fiat Chrysler Automobile FCHA.MI and Nissan Motor 7201.T.As well as the 49.9% stake it took in Proton three years ago, the broader Geely group - Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], led by Taizhou-born billionaire Li Shufu - now also comprises a 9.7% stake in Germany's Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and a majority stake in British sport car brand Lotus.And while giants from Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and General Motors Co GM.N have followed a similar shared platform projects for their respective brands, Geely's strategy is a first for a Chinese company. The automaker plans to develop all its future models for the Geely and Lynk &amp; Co brands on CMA or other related product platforms, like BMA. It is also developing a new architecture to accelerate the launch of pure battery electric vehicles with intelligent connectivity functions, said Li, a former Ford F.N engineer.In addition, Geely wants to shift development of next generations of some popular existing models, like Borui and Emgrand sedans, to those architectures, he said. It takes around 18 months for Geely to significantly change a CMA-based car, versus 24-30 months to do so on a non-CMA-based model.Using CMA, plant managers can switch production of different models to maintain smooth overall capacity utilisation rates at production lines, said Oskar Falk, the Volvo-trained head at Geely and Volvo’s first joint production site in Taizhou.The plant already exports Volvo Polestar 2 electric sedans to the United States and Europe, and is preparing to make Volvo’s first battery-powered electric vehicle, Falk said.Geely also plans to start exporting China-made Lynk &amp; Co 01 SUVs to Europe this year.	0.4288887187
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The display stands packed with glimmering sheet metal were smaller than usual and all-new models were scarce. Even most forecasts for a recovery in sales were modest, in keeping with the mood as the Sao Paulo Auto Show opened on Tuesday.It was a testament to the crisis wracking the Brazilian car market, once the world’s fourth-largest. Since reaching a record 3.8 million vehicles in 2012, the market has nearly halved in size.Executives put on brave faces. Most said the projected end of Brazil’s grinding recession next year would allow for single-digit market growth - the first sales upturn in five years.Yet few seemed ready to make big new bets on a market where automakers poured billions into new factories on the eve of the downturn. More than half of that capacity in Brazil now lies idle.Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE is cutting investments in Brazil in the five years through 2020 to 7 billion reais ($2.20 billion), down from 10 billion reais in the five years through 2018, said Volkswagen do Brasil Chief Executive David Powels. Ford Motor Co's F.N new chief executive for South America, Lyle Watters, said the U.S. automaker planned to rebound after its drop from fourth to sixth place in the market, but had little to say about how. “I don’t get out of bed in the morning to be in sixth place,�� Watters said. The only new model he announced, the Mustang, will start being imported to Brazil in 2018.Watters and other executives projecting a recovery in 2017 weighted their optimism to the second half of next year, once interest rates recede further from decade-highs and double-digit unemployment is expected to subside.The most aggressive forecasts came from brands positioned to capture a slice of the growing sport utility vehicle segment, especially compacts and crossovers.The Jeep division of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI aims to sell 90,000 vehicles in Brazil next year, up from 60,000 this year, as it adds domestic production of the Compass, according to Latin America director Sergio Ferreira. SUV sales are likely to grow to more than 17 percent of the Brazilian market next year, Ferreira said, up from 15 percent this year. That is more than twice the 7 percent growth seen in 2012, before Jeep built a plant in northeastern Brazil.The most upbeat outlook for the market, an outlier among other forecasts, came from General Motors Co GM.N, whose Chevrolet brand passed Fiat this year as the best-selling in Brazil for the first time in over a decade. GM, which is bringing its Tracker SUV to Brazil, expects Brazilians to buy 2.4 million new cars and light trucks in 2017, up from around 2.1 million this year, said Carlos Zarlenga, the head of GM in Brazil.That is still a far cry from 2012’s 3.8 million sales. “We think the market is going to accelerate in the second half of the year,�� said Zarlenga.Few are counting on such fast-paced growth in what Anfavea, the association that represents automakers in Brazil, says is now the world’s seventh-biggest car market.But Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, which tripled its market share in the crisis to 9 percent, has increased sales 1 percent this year and said on Tuesday it plans to increase them again by 1 percent next.Toyota’s top executive in Latin America, Steve St. Angelo, is among those counting on acceleration in a market long stuck in neutral or reverse.In an interview ahead of the car show, he told Reuters he expected to see the overall Brazilian market grow around 5 percent next year.	9.990161882

(Repeats to widen distribution)WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Days before a group of Republican lawmakers were due to discuss their party’s controversial proposal to tax all imports, Toyota Motor Corp sent an urgent message to its U.S. dealers - tell the politicians the tax would seriously hurt car buyers.Some of Toyota’s 1,500 dealers heeded the call and contacted members of the House of Representatives�� tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, urging them to rethink their proposal, according to people familiar with the effort. Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would force consumers to pay potentially thousands of dollars more for vehicles, they warned.The Japanese automaker’s mobilization of its army of dealers underscores the growing alarm among some of the world’s largest companies that sell imported goods in the United States. They fear a big tax on imports would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products.“Cost is going to go up, as a result demand is going to go down. As a result, we’re not going to able to employ as many as people as we do today. That’s my biggest fear,�� Toyota’s North America CEO Jim Lentz said in an interview.Toyota dealers employ more than 97,000 people in the United States.While companies and industry groups frequently lobby Congress, the threat of an import tax has mobilized an unusually broad swath of firms at home and abroad. That lobbying effort is taking place largely out of the public eye partly to avoid potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who has attacked companies for manufacturing abroad for U.S. consumers.Earlier this month Trump targeted Toyota, threatening to impose a hefty fee on the world’s largest automaker if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico.The White House said last week that a border tax is one option under review to pay for a wall with Mexico, although what exactly Trump is planning to do is still not clear. He has pledged to impose a “big border tax�� on Mexican imports.The plan proposed by House Republicans would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose the 20 percent tax on imports.Companies that rely heavily on imports say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax.As car dealers are reaching out to members of Congress in their districts, Toyota and other automakers are lobbying lawmakers in states where they have large manufacturing plants and employ thousands of workers.The No. 3 vehicle seller in the United States behind General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, Toyota imports about 1.2 million vehicles to the U.S. market annually, half of its 2.4 million U.S. sales. It employs 40,000 people directly.Toyota and the automakers are not alone in this lobbying effort.Target Corp’s chief executive, Brian Cornell, traveled to Washington to meet members of the House Ways and Means Committee. He told them an import tax could impact consumers�� ability to buy essential goods, such as baby supplies that are made overseas and imported to the United States, according to a person familiar with the talks. Target spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins confirmed the visit.The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy, headquartered down the road from Minneapolis-based Target, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers. It cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company’s projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss.The flyer, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, argues that foreign Internet sellers like China’s Alibaba.com would be able to avoid the tax by making sales online and shipping to U.S. consumers directly, “undercutting U.S. businesses.”Company officials have been handing out the flyer to lawmakers and their staff on Capitol Hill, Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman confirmed.Constellation Brands, which brews Corona and Modelo in Mexico, has been pushing lawmakers to exempt products like Mexican beer in any border tax “because it’s inherently a Mexican product,�� CEO Rob Sands said on an earnings call.But if that effort fails, Constellation is prepared to buy more raw materials from the United States instead of Mexico, Sands said.Koch Industries, the second-largest private U.S. company according to Forbes, said in a statement a border tax would have a “devastating�� impact on consumers. The company, owned by Republican donors Charles and David Koch, includes oil refining and manufacturing interests.Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political group founded by the billionaire brothers, told Reuters the powerful group has started to educate its network of activists about the tax, so they can lobby against it. AFP says it has two million activists.Not everyone in corporate America is worried about a new border tax.Several aerospace companies including Boeing Co, United Technologies Corp and Raytheon Co said in earnings calls last week that a border tax could be positive for net exporters like them.“We see the aerospace sector as fundamentally having an advantage in that regard,�� Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said.The American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA), however, called the proposal “heart stopping,�� in a letter last week to 9,500 dealers selling vehicles like Toyota, Volkswagen, and BMW.Opponents of the border tax may have already found some allies.Republican Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, where BMW has a large plant, said the importance of foreign automakers such as BMW and Toyota to the economy needs to be considered when making laws.“I cannot overstate how significant that industry is to my state,�� Gowdy said in an interview, adding that he and his wife both drive Toyotas.

DETROIT, March 7 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it is recalling more than 681,000 cars and trucks in the U.S. market to address potential problems.The Japanese automaker said it will recall about 495,000 Tacoma pickup trucks from model years 2005 to 2009 to replace a part in the steering wheel. It is also recalling about 70,500 Camry mid-sized cars and 116,000 Venza crossover vehicles from model years 2009 to 2011 to replace a stop lamp switch.Toyota said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries in either case.For the Tacoma, Toyota will replace the steering wheel spiral cable assembly because friction may occur over time involving that part, which may result in the driver’s side airbag being deactivated and not deploying in an accident.For the Camry and Venza, silicon grease during assembly may lead to increased electrical resistance that can cause the vehicle not to start or the shift lever not to move from the “park�� position, Toyota said.Both fixes will take about 30 minutes, the company said. Owners of the affected Tacomas will be notified in early April, while the others will be alerted as soon as Toyota has the necessary replacement parts.	-0.9936984973
BEIJING, June 3 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners sold a total of 81,136 automobiles in China in May on a preliminary estimated basis, up roughly 3 percent from a year earlier, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.That compares to 79,000 vehicles it sold in May 2013. Toyota’s sales in China rose 12.4 percent in April and 19 percent in March.During the first five months of the year, Japan’s biggest automaker sold a total of 394,902 vehicles, up 16 percent from a year earlier, the sources said.Toyota is scheduled to officially announce its overall China sales for May later on Tuesday.A China-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment.The sources said the pace of growth slowed in May chiefly because sales of the Corolla, a major product for Toyota’s manufacturing and sales joint venture with China FAW Group Corp, fell sharply ahead of the planned launch of a redesigned version of the Corolla this summer. They didn’t elaborate on specific reasons for the slowdown.Overall, however, they said Toyota is on track to be able to sell more than 1.1 million vehicles in China this year - a target the company set at the outset of the year. The company first targeted sales of 1 million vehicles a year in China in 2010.Last year, Toyota sold 917,500 vehicles in China.Toyota operates joint ventures in China with FAW Group and Guangzhou Automobile Group.

MANILA (Reuters) - Top Japanese automakers in the Philippines are threatening to shift production to cheaper Southeast Asian countries as the government drags its feet on a plan to rebuild its shrinking car manufacturing industry.The potential pullout of production lines by Toyota Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Motors, which have a combined 50,000 vehicle annual capacity in the country, would mean the Philippines could lose more than 1,000 jobs and millions of dollars worth of planned and existing investments.Time is running out, industry officials say, because there’s less than two years left in the term of President Benigno Aquino, who has been backing the plan.“I believe that if this does not get approved this quarter and signed by the president by the end of the year and even in the first quarter next year, then let’s forget about it because nothing will happen anymore,�� said Ferdinand Raquelsantos, head of the motor vehicle parts industry group MVPMAP.The original government plan includes tax incentives to help rebuild the country’s tiny auto industry and turn it into a major manufacturing hub.But two years of government and industry debates, revisions and disagreements over how best to grow the auto sector have carmakers saying they may move to cheaper countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.The reforms have also been delayed because Manila wants the industry to ramp up production first to produce 40,000 units of a single car model annually before they can use the incentives. Industry insiders say only Toyota could meet that requirement with no incentives.The carmakers had hoped to capitalize on the government roadmap to boost local production after car sales hit record highs for several months this year on robust consumer spending, and vehicle ownership remains the lowest among Southeast Asia’s five biggest economies at just around 35 per 1,000 people.“We have been telling the government, please issue the roadmap so there will be a clear policy direction and basis for Toyota’s investments in the Philippines,�� Rommel Gutierrez, spokesman of Toyota Philippines, told Reuters. Gutierrez also serves as president of the auto industry group CAMPI.“The mother company in Japan has many options, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia...As early as now, it is already scouting (for locations),�� Gutierrez said, adding it’s debating whether to continue production of Vios compact and Innova in the Philippines in the absence of clear policy direction.The Philippine unit of Mitsubishi Motors, which has been planning to more than triple its existing capacity after purchasing a former Ford Motors plant earlier this year, hasn’t decided on starting local production of new models.“Without the EO (executive order), I am not so sure if we will launch a new car or not,�� Hikosaburo Shibata, president and chief executive of Mitsubishi Philippines, told Reuters.Government officials declined to comment on a target date for the roadmap, but automakers say based on discussions with the government the plan will likely be released this year.“We have to balance. It’s always a cost-benefit trade-off,�� said Trade Secretary Gregory Domingo, adding the government is continuing consultations with industry and state agencies.Carmakers are hoping the plan will include adequate fiscal and non-fiscal incentives such as tax credits and common testing facilities for auto parts makers to ease manufacturing disadvantages. It costs around $1,800 to $2,000 more to produce a locally assembled car than it is to import a complete vehicle, according to industry estimates.The Philippines ceased being a car exporter after Ford closed local production in 2012 partly due to increasing imports of pre-owned cars, most of them smuggled, and tariff relaxation after trade deals.	2.789773709
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Intuition Robotics, an Israeli developer of artificial intelligence robots for use by the elderly, said on Tuesday it raised $14 million in an early stage funding round led by the Toyota Research Institute (TRI).OurCrowd, iRobot, Maniv Mobility, Terra Venture Partners, Bloomberg Beta and other private investors also participated.The investment in Intuition Robotics is TRI’s first outside investment in robotic technology specifically for older adults.Intuition Robotics�� product, ElliQ, is being developed to promote an active lifestyle, with the goal of helping older adults benefit from technology that is easy to use, the company said.“We believe Intuition Robotics�� technology in the field of cognitive computing has strong potential to positively impact the world’s aging population,�� said Gill Pratt, chief executive of Toyota’s research institute.	2.047874761
* Nikkei rises 0.09%, Topix adds 0.14%* Stocks recoup earlier losses as yen weakens to 2-mth lowTOKYO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average recouped early losses and ended marginally higher on Thursday, supported by a weaker yen which helped offset disappointment that the U.S. Federal Reserve is not embarking on a lengthy easing cycle.The Fed on Wednesday lowered rates for the first time since 2008, as widely expected, but Chairman Jerome Powell said the move was not the start of a long series of rate cuts, sending U.S. share markets lower.The Nikkei ended the day up 0.09% at 21,540.99 points.The index initially fell as much as 1% but clawed back ground as the yen slid to a two-month low against the dollar after the Fed proved less dovish than anticipated.“Prior to the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, the chief concern was that while a rate cut was expected to be good for equities, it could also end up strengthening the yen by weakening the dollar,�� said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.“But Powell’s views doused strong yen concerns, and that has been supportive for Japanese stocks.”Shares of exporters, which benefit from a weaker yen, advanced. Toyota Motor Corp rose 1%, Honda Motor Co edged up 0.4%, Canon Inc added 0.9% and Nintendo advanced 3.3%.Nomura Holdings rallied 9% as the investment bank said its first-quarter profit soared more than ten-fold after restructuring its portfolio.Other financial shares also rose with Daiwa Securities Group climbing 2.5% and Shinsei Bank advancing 3.8%.Takeda Pharmaceutical gained 7.4% after its sales in the April-June quarter increased 88.8%.Kao Corporation, on the other hand, fell 3.4% after the cosmetic product maker saw its January-June net profit decline 8.8%.The broader Topix rose 0.14% to 1,567.35.Of Tokyo’s 33 subindexes, 13 were in positive territory, led by securities.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government should disclose what post-Brexit reassurances it offered Japanese carmaker Toyota 7203.T ahead of a 240-million pound ($313 million) investment in its English car plant, two parliamentary committee heads said on Monday.On Friday, Reuters cited two sources saying that Britain had helped to secure an investment in the firm’s Burnaston car plant with a letter reassuring the Japanese automaker over future trading arrangements.The business ministry has confirmed the existence of a letter but has refused to release it.One of the sources said the letter to Toyota was similar to one sent to Japanese carmaker Nissan 7201.T last year when it decided to build two new models at its plant in northern England.The previous chairman of parliament’s Treasury Select Committee raised questions about the Nissan deal last year. Reuters contacted the new committee chairwoman on Monday for comment on the reported reassurances to Toyota.“To provide clarity to the public, as the assurances may cost the taxpayer money, and to other businesses, who are craving certainty to plan for Brexit, the letters should be published immediately,�� Nicky Morgan said in an emailed statement.“It remains to be seen what these assurances could have been that were robust enough for them to invest in the UK, but avoided any obligation to report to parliament,�� she said.A Toyota spokesman referred to the company’s statement from the day of the March 16 investment announcement which said the British government was providing up to 21.3 million pounds in funding for training and research and development.The chairwoman of parliament’s business committee, opposition Labour lawmaker Rachel Reeves, said it was unacceptable that the government had refused to disclose its private reassurances to Toyota.“It is vital that the government is not seen to be cutting sweetheart deals or granting special favors that could undermine our negotiating position,�� she said in a statement.“The government needs to swiftly develop an open and inclusive strategy when it comes to its Brexit negotiations that offer all sectors the best chance of success when it comes to creating jobs and securing investment.”A business ministry spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Business minister Greg Clark suggested last year that assurances offered to Nissan were available to other firms.The opposition Labour Party said “secretive, one-off deals were unfair and showed a lack of coherent strategy.“The government can’t go round making individual deals with some companies whilst leaving others out in the cold,�� said the party’s business spokeswoman Rebecca Long-Bailey.A first full round of Brexit negotiations kicked off on Monday in Brussels amid divisions among British Prime Minister Theresa May’s ministers over what form Britain’s exit from the European Union should take.Major car firms are worried about the long-term viability of their British plants and are using their upcoming investment decisions to push for promises to maintain free trade after Britain’s exit from the EU, which is due to take place in March 2019.	1.318181818
(Repeats item first carried on Sunday)BEIJING/MUMBAI, July 14 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co takes the veil off the first car in its resurrected Datsun brand in New Delhi on Monday - a sub-400,000-rupee ($6,700) hatchback that is part of a foray by the Japanese auto maker into cheap cars for emerging markets.With the Datsun hatchback and other Datsun models to follow over the next three years - one of which could be priced as low as $4,000 (240,000 rupees) if Nissan can meet its aggressive manufacturing cost objectives - Nissan is treading ever so closer to the ultra-low-cost car market.That market in India is now famously occupied by the Tata Nano, a barebones car that retails for between 150,000 and 220,000 rupees.“We try to keep the price positioning for Datsun competitive, so that products are appealing�� to the lower half of the auto market in India where Nissan has few products competing today, Nissan’s programme director for Datsun, Ashwani Gupta, told Reuters in an interview.It is a move that has been generally resisted so far by other global auto giants, such as Toyota Motor Corp., out of concern a scruffy, ultra-cheap car model could tarnish their high-value brands.Top Toyota executives, including current chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, rejected a chief engineer’s design for a low-cost emerging market car several years ago, saying it was too cheap to be called a Toyota, an engineering executive said.The car has since undergone some design iterations and was finally launched in India in 2010 as the Toyota Etios sedan, which starts at 545,000 rupees. A hatchback version of the car, launched in 2011, starts at about 450,000 rupees.Since Nissan plans to market Datsun cars in India through its existing Nissan-branded dealerships, Datsun could expose the Japanese auto maker to similar risks, though executives downplay the possibility.They say use of a separate brand name should effectively shield Nissan’s brand image. Datsun, which Nissan once used for its cars outside Japan, has a history dating back to the 1930s.“We’re serving different customers�� with Datsun, said Tatjana Natarova, a Datsun spokeswoman. “That’s why we came up with a different brand.”To make Datsun cars affordable, Nissan has been aiming to reduce manufacturing costs to $3,000 to $5,000 per vehicle. The first car is due for a launch in India early next year and Gupta said the company has partially achieved the cost goals.Still, as price-competitive as that may be, it will face formidable competition from Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor Co, which together control two-thirds of India’s passenger car market, excluding SUVs and vans.Maruti has about 1,200 retail stores in India, while Hyundai operates a network of more than 350 stores. Nissan, by contrast, has only about 100 dealers, though it says it plans to triple the number of its stores to 300 by March 2017.Nissan said last year it would revive the Datsun name as a marquee for emerging markets, starting with India, Russia and Indonesia. Eventually, it wants to expand into Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.To make the new name stick, Nissan does not plan to stop with a sub-400,000-rupee car. It plans to expand the Datsun brand’s appeal by following its first car with a second model by the end of next year and a third vehicle by 2016.Nissan is still trying to meet the goal of producing a Datsun car for as little as $3,000 per vehicle, said an executive speaking on condition of anonymity.“If we met that, there would be a good possibility we could offer the car for $4,000 on the retail market,�� the executive said.That is not as cheap as the Nano, but Nissan is not aiming to compete head-on with the Nano any way, the executive said.By the year ending March 2017, Nissan wants to capture 10 percent of India’s overall passenger vehicle market that includes sedans, sport-utility vehicles and vans. Nissan had a market share of less than 1 percent as of May, data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers shows.By then, Datsun aims to generate one third to a half of overall sales in India, which bought 2.7 million passenger vehicles in the year ended March 2013, Gupta said.To achieve low manufacturing costs, the Datsun product team designed and engineered cars so that “nearly all�� the components needed to build them could be procured within India, Gupta said.India has a relatively limited auto parts supply base so procuring almost all the necessary components locally poses a challenge. Gupta said though that Nissan aims to pull off the feat not only in India, but in Indonesia and Russia as well.Gupta said Datsun cars would be stripped of features and functions that do not offer “value�� to customers in markets they target to make cars affordable.Nissan thus will likely avoid developing new technology. Instead, it will use tried technology, in particular vehicle underpinnings, engines and transmissions, which are costly to develop. It is also likely to pare down expensive features such as power-windows, navigation systems, and extra safety airbags. (Editing by Neil Fullick)	-0.285405739
(Refiled to correct punctuation in first sentence)FRANKFURT, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Austrian Hans Dieter Poetsch, Volkswagen AG’s finance chief, faces a massive task in his future role as chairman - to maintain the support of the often divided stakeholders who have chosen to back him while improving the carmaker’s profitability.Although Volkswagen Group has grown to become the world’s largest carmaker it has proven to be one of the most difficult companies to manage as radical reforms can be blocked by labour representatives, who hold half the seats on the supervisory board, and its home state of Lower Saxony, which controls a 20 percent stake in the company.Poetsch, who has been VW’s chief financial officer for 13 years, was chosen as chairman on Thursday because he is seen as a relatively neutral and unthreatening figure.Unlike some other senior VW engineers, he has avoided becoming seen as too beholden to ousted former chairman Ferdinand Piech or Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn.Poetsch’s gentle demeanour should help him mend fences at VW which has been rocked by the clash between Piech and Winterkorn, but analysts and observers wonder whether a consensus-oriented approach is what VW needs right now.Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, professor of automotive industry economics at the University of Duisburg Essen, said Poetsch, a former chief executive of automotive paintshop systems manufacturer Duerr, was a bad choice.“He’s nice, approachable. He’s good to go out for a drink or a bite to eat with. He’s not the type who likes conflict,�� Dudenhoeffer said. “He’s a stop-gap because they couldn’t find a strong external candidate.”However, Volkswagen’s belief that it makes the best cars in the world is seen as having led it to a German-centric, top-down management approach that has prevented it from developing cars that meet the tastes of Chinese and American consumers.“Peace is the worst thing that can happen to VW. That means ‘keep going in the same direction��,�� Dudenhoeffer said.Piech, the departed industrial scion and grandson of Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche, was no stranger to conflict and radical decisions.For years, he managed the balance of power between powerful labour representatives, senior VW managers and shareholders, sometimes by ousting his own staff, as in the case of former CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder.Meanwhile, Poetsch worked in the background, ensuring that Volkswagen Group had the financial means to absorb bold acquisitions masterminded by his fellow Austrian, Piech, such as the purchase of truck makers MAN and Scania , sportscar maker Porsche and motorbike maker Ducati .Now he faces the task of reining in some of VW’s bloated operations to boost profits, even if that means making himself unpopular at headquarters by cutting jobs at home.“He has a clear understanding of the key financial problems the group is facing,�� said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, welcoming the appointment.After years of chasing growth VW overtook Toyota as the world’s largest carmaker earlier this year, delivering 5.04 million vehicles in the January to June period, ahead of Toyota’s 5.02 million, but it did so far less efficiently.In the quarter ended June 30, Toyota had 342,872 employees. In contrast, Volkswagen has 597,800 staff, according to quarterly results.A former head of group controlling at BMW, Poetsch also has plenty of insight into engineering processes, having studied industrial engineering at the Techical University in Darmstadt before spending his entire career in finance.Given his focus on the numbers, and his success in integrating Porsche, VW’s rival factions threw their backing behind Poetsch to hold the role as chairman, a post which casts the deciding vote on any restructuring decisions.“His appointment lays the foundations for a trusting relationship between the management and supervisory board,�� Lower Saxony premier Stephan Weil said in a statement. “The naming of Poetsch is a good decision for Volkswagen and therefore also for Lower Saxony.�� (Writing by Edward Taylor; Editing by Greg Mahlich)	4.995708155
DETROIT (Reuters) - Family sedans like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord are losing ground this year as American families and empty-nest baby boomers find they would rather handle life’s daily chores in a crossover.Midsize sedans remain the single largest segment of the U.S. auto industry. But their share of the industry has shrunk this year, alongside a gain for vehicles like the Ford Escape, executives and analysts said on Wednesday.“While the segment is still growing year-over-year, it’s nowhere near what it was growing last year as the industry was launching a lot of new midsize cars,�� Bill Fay, the U.S. head of the Toyota brand, said during a call with reporters to discuss U.S. auto sales in April.U.S. auto sales are being propelled by pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles, as shown by U.S. auto sales in April by major automakers.Crossovers, which are SUVs built on a car-based platform, are appealing because they offer more space for groceries and golf clubs than the typical sedan, and they are easier for people to enter and exit. And fuel mileage is improving.Perhaps most importantly, the price gap has narrowed between midsize sedans and compact crossovers like the Ford Motor Co Escape, and the Toyota Motor Corp RAV4 and the Honda Motor Co CR-V.A small crossover costs just $1,300 more than the typical family sedan, according to Kelley Blue Book. Excluding state taxes, this amounts to less than $20 in monthly payments in some cases.“Fundamentally, both serve the family market,�� said Mustafa Mohatarem, General Motors Co’s chief economist.“Midsize cars have gotten smaller and more expensive, because of a variety of factors,�� he said. “People are switching to crossovers, because they satisfy the family needs very well.”The closing gap in price is encouraging some buyers to consider paying more for a crossover for the additional space and flexibility, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting with LMC Automotive.“When there was a further separation between the two, there weren’t so much a substitution for each other,�� he said.Midsize sedans accounted for 17 percent of the U.S. auto market during the first quarter, compared with 17.7 percent during the same period last year, according to LMC Automotive.The shift has hit Japanese automakers, which dominate the sedan segment. Camry sales fell 14 percent in April as overall U.S. auto sales rose 8.5 percent. Sales of the Accord, which Honda redesigned last year, fell 5 percent.The falloff in sedan sales is also due to tough competition in the segment, where several top-selling models have been recently redesigned, including the Ford Fusion.Midsize sedans also got smaller incentive during the month. Incentives on mid-size sedans averaged $2,098 in April, nearly 10 percent lower than industry incentives overall, according to data from Edmunds.com.Toyota Motor Corp’s April sales fell short of estimates in due in part to tighter competition for the Camry in this bread-and-butter segment, said KBB analyst Alec Gutierrez. Camry is Toyota’s top-selling vehicle in the U.S. market.“Camry will likely be quite strong but not as strong as if it were not facing Fusion, Altima and Accord,�� Gutierrez said.	1.599930058
(Adds Geely comments in paragraph 10, 11)KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Malaysian car maker Proton could return to profit this year after years of losses, driven by new product launches and aggressive cost-cutting under a joint management with China’s Geely, its chief executive officer said.It would mark the company’s first annual profit since Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owner of Volvo Cars, bought a 49.9% stake in the loss-making company in 2017, injecting cash and new technology to help Proton’s turnaround.“I think this year we could make a profit. Financial performance has improved a lot. You will see the numbers at the end of this year,�� said Li Chunrong, who has been Proton’s CEO since Geely’s acquisition.“We are confident that next year we will be profitable.”Founded in 1983, Proton has reported losses for years and had resorted to state aid for survival, hit by intensifying competition from Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp’s Daihatsu and Honda Motor Co.Proton reported a net loss of 481 million ringgit ($115 million) in its financial year that ended in March, according to local conglomerate DRB-HICOM, which owns the remaining stake at Proton.However, the 2017 deal with Geely, which also has a stake in Daimler, helped it win back customers.Proton launched five new models over the past year including the popular X70 sport utility vehicle which is based on Geely’s Boyue, and saved 250 million ringgit in costs, Li said.The Malaysian company is nearing its target of selling 93,000 cars this year and expects sales to hit 100,000 units, up around 54% from last year.Geely and Proton have invested over 1.2 billion ringgit to expand and upgrade Proton’s car manufacturing facilities, Geely said in a statement.The partners will build the X70 in Proton’s revamped car plant, which is able to make other Geely models, according to the statement.Li said Proton is likely to set a 2020 target of a 30% rise in vehicle sales, as its board meets on Saturday to set performance goals.Proton’s strong recovery, which helped it become the No.2 car maker in Malaysia this year, trailing only Daihatsu’s Perodua, comes as the country’s auto market is seen growing just 1.1% next year to 610,000 vehicles, according to AmInvestment Bank.Proton wants to claim the top position in Malaysia by 2027 and become a top-3 player in Southeast Asia where it currently ranks the ninth biggest, as it looks to export to key markets of Thailand and Indonesia.	-1.382165158
LONDON (Reuters) - Toyota’s Anthony Davidson starts the defense of his world endurance title at Silverstone this weekend with Le Mans on his mind.The 24 Hours at the Circuit de la Sarthe in western France on June 13-14 is the jewel of the championship, a classic test that has mauled many a driver over the years and that every sportscar racer wants to win.“We had a big fight on our hands last year all the way through (the championship),�� the 35-year-old Briton told Reuters in an interview ahead of Sunday’s Six Hours of Silverstone season-opener.“We didn’t win Le Mans -- that was our main target for the season and we didn’t achieve that. So that remains the same for this year.“I think it’s going to be hard to defend the championship and possibly even harder to win Le Mans. But it should be a great fight.”Davidson won last year’s endurance championship with Switzerland’s Sebastien Buemi but finished only third at Le Mans after a heavy crash on a wet track early on in the race with Frenchman Nicolas Lapierre at the wheel.In the 2013 race, Davidson finished second while in 2012 he had a massive crash that saw the car take off at the Mulsanne corner and left the Briton in hospital with two broken vertebrae.The experience has in no way dimmed the former Formula One driver’s enthusiasm or determination.“I feel personally as a driver I have tamed it,�� he said.“I feel I know how to win that race. I’ve led it a couple of times outright and it’s looked like I’ve been on my way to winning it.“I feel like the team had the recipe to win it last year, we had the fastest car and on my car we had the reliability to win it. We would have won it at a canter, well over six laps, if we didn’t have the crash early on in the race due to the weather.”A victory this year would be more than welcome, however it might come.“If I am handed the victory this year...I would quite happily take it because it would make up for all the times when I did deserve to win it (and did not),�� said Davidson, who now has the number one on his Toyota.“To the average person on the street, to tell them that you won the 24 hours of Le Mans...sounds more impressive (than the championship).“People in the know, know what the championship means. But for something to hang your hat on, of course Le Mans is an amazing achievement.”So too is winning the world endurance title, a championship growing in stature in the motorsport world even if crowds -- with the exception of the 250,000 thronging Le Mans -- are comparatively small.Toyota face a big battle this season against perennial Le Mans favorites and winners Audi as well as the Porsche works cars.The eight round calendar includes six hour races at Spa-Francorchamps, the Nuerburgring, in Austin, Texas, at Japan’s Fuji circuit, Shanghai and Bahrain.“In the second year of a stable set of regulations it seems that everyone has improved, we’ve all honed our cars as you’d expect,�� said Davidson of the battle ahead.“I think it’s probably going to be more of the same in terms of the level of competition.��	1.55781049
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen and FiatChrysler could face penalties of up to 1.83 billion euros ($2.08 billion) and 746 million euros respectively, if they fail to meet the European Union’s emissions targets set for 2021, according to AlixPartners.The study by the consulting firm, which was published on Wednesday, shows how hard it is for carmakers to meet European rules for cutting average fleet emissions for passenger cars to 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2021.AlixPartners forecast the size of potential penalties based on the vehicle emissions levels reported by carmakers at the end of 2017. Since then, major carmakers have reduced carbon dioxide emissions through higher sales of electric and hybrid vehicles.Volkswagen said it plans to comply with the European rules while FiatChrysler has said it will pursue the cheapest option for complying with the rules, a step which may include paying fines.Volvo and Toyota are the only major carmaking groups which do not face penalties, and could sell their surplus emission credits to other carmakers, the study showed.Volkswagen Group, faces the biggest fine because it is Europe’s biggest carmaker by market share. To meet European Union emissions rules it plans to mass produce electric cars in 2020.“If you build heavier cars and have a large market share of diesels you have some homework to do if you want to mitigate possible penalties,�� said Elmar Kades, Managing Director at AlixPartners.“Customers are switching to petrol and this needs to be compensated with electrification and or hybridization.”In its Global Automotive Outlook study, AlixPartners said that car sales will stagnate or decline in the next three years, hitting the margins of suppliers and carmakers, particularly those balancing sales of electric and combustion engine cars.Designing and building both combustion engine and fully electric cars simultaneously costs automakers $2.3 billion per platform per year, the study said.“One of the most dramatic developments is that demand is stagnant or falling, while investments are at an all time high. To counter margin deterioration we see comprehensive cost cutting measures across the board,�� Kades said.($1 = 0.8780 euros)	7.024089545
TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp downgraded its full-year revenue forecast citing an uncertain outlook in emerging countries, even as it reported a 26 percent jump in second-quarter operating profit on Thursday, bolstered by a weak yen and cost cuts.The world’s top-selling automaker said July-September operating profit rose to 827.40 billion yen ($6.81 billion) from 659.22 billion a year earlier, beating a mean estimate of 803.12 billion yen drawn from forecasts by 11 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/ data.Net profit rose 13.5 percent to 611.72 billion yen.	0.2322601313
(Repeats story that first ran on Friday; no change in text)* Weaker yen was boon for Japan’s automakers* But FX turnaround will mean belt-tightening ...* ... just as technology shifts requite bigger R&amp;D spendBy Naomi TajitsuTOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - Japan’s three leading automakers expect a stronger yen will cost them around $14 billion in lost operating profit this year alone - just as they need to invest more in everything from cleaner fuel to driver-less cars.After three years of supernormal profits on the back of a weaker currency, Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor now face a reality check as the yen has turned around.While the recent years�� currency boon has filled automakers�� coffers - Toyota alone has around $10 billion in cash - a squeeze on margins will put them under pressure to focus their investments, analysts say.“How to respond to yen rises while securing profits and continuing future investments: this balance is important,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Takahiko Ijichi said this week.The U.S. dollar climbed roughly 60 percent against the yen between late-2011 and mid-2015, a huge windfall for Japan’s car makers, but so far this year it is down roughly 9 percent against the Japanese currency.Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, has forecast a 40 percent drop in operating profits this year because of the stronger yen - a 935 billion yen ($8.6 billion) hit for a company that exported nearly half its Japanese production last year. Honda forecast a 303 billion yen hit to its operating profit, while Nissan expects a “massive impact�� of 255 billion yen on its operating profit.Even automakers that have invested more in local production outside Japan expect some currency pain. Suzuki Motor Corp , which through its Maruti Suzuki venture has almost 50 percent market share in India, expects annual net profit to fall by a fifth.This is all money that could be invested in cleaner alternative propulsion systems, technology to link cars to data services and the development of autonomous driving.In the United States, for example, General Motors has invested $500 million in ride-sharing service Lyft to develop an on-demand network of autonomous vehicles. It also bought Cruise Automation, a San Francisco start-up focused on developing driver-less cars.Toyota has said it would set up a research and development company to focus on artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley, in a departure from its cautious stance on automated driving.Japan’s ‘big three�� automakers are, however, verging on the conservative with their assumed yen rate of 105 to the dollar, which is more downbeat than a Reuters poll of foreign exchange analysts, which forecast the yen easing to 115 per dollar by next April.And that is already having an impact.Toyota forecast its smallest rise - just over 2 percent - in R&amp;D spending in four years, to 1.1 trillion yen in 2017.“We’re seeing a double whammy of yen strength combined with Japan Inc’s tendency to give very conservative guidance,�� said Stefan Worrall, director of Japan equity sales at Credit Suisse.“So you have to acknowledge some uncertainty over how much capex will actually be impacted by the stronger yen because we’re unsure just how much exaggeration we’re seeing in dim earnings forecasts.”Nissan, whose development capacities may be boosted by a proposed tie-up with Mitsubishi Motors, has ramped up production of its Rogue crossover SUV in Japan, a model that has been selling well in the United States. That made sense when the yen was weak, less so now.But capacity constraints mean Nissan has little hope of altering its plans to increase Japan production.“We’re not using it as a strategy, we’re using it as an opportunity. We have capacity available in Japan and no capacity available in North America,�� said CEO Carlos Ghosn.He called the stronger yen a “massive headwind��.In the short term, companies will look to rein in costs, analysts say - and that could be bad news for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to stimulate a stalled economic recovery, as salaries will likely be a prime target.($1 = 108.7400 yen)	1.646498711
PARIS (Reuters) - European car sales rose 5.9 percent in October, according to industry data published on Thursday, with Renault and Toyota leading the gains among volume carmakers.Registrations advanced to 1.208 million cars in the European Union and European Free Trade Area from 1.17 million a year earlier, Brussels-based industry association ACEA said. The gain takes the European market expansion this year to 3.8 percent.Toyota’s monthly sales jumped 20.5 percent, while France’s Renault posted a 17.6 percent increase in group registrations powered by strong demand for its no-frills Dacia lineup.PSA registrations jumped 74 percent after it began reporting sales by the Opel and Vauxhall brands it recently acquired from General Motors alongside its own Peugeot, Citroen and DS marques.

(Corrects July 28 story to state in sixth paragraph that Toyota is reporting first-quarter, not first-half, results on Tuesday; also corrects day in advisory line to Tuesday, not Thursday)* Toyota H1 sales fall 1.5 pct to 5.02 mln cars* VW reported 5.04 mln H1 deliveries on July 17* Toyota says emerging markets, mini-vehicle taxes weighedBy Andreas Cremer and Minami FunakoshiMUNICH/TOKYO, July 28 (Reuters) - Volkswagen overtook Toyota as the world’s largest carmaker by sales in the first half year, achieving its long-held ambition three years ahead of target.But staying on top will be a challenge for the German maker of the Golf and Polo, as deliveries are falling in China, destination of a third of its global sales, making it overly reliant on relatively stagnant western European demand.“The hunt for scale only makes sense if it boosts synergies, something VW hasn’t really been able to achieve,�� said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank. “Dependence on China is VW’s weak spot and managing such a large group inevitably poses problems.”VW has been pushing for greater scale under Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn’s eight-year reign, propelled by adding brands and factories and roaring sales in China.The German group on July 17 reported 5.04 million deliveries in the first half year. By comparison, Toyota said on Tuesday it sold 5.02 million cars between January and June, a 1.5 percent decline on year-ago levels.Toyota, due to announce first-quarter earnings next Tuesday, said sales were dragged down by a slowdown in emerging markets and increased taxes on mini vehicles in Japan.VW’s rapid expansion has masked underperformance in the United States and Brazil, where it has been slow to upgrade models and adjust its offerings to market trends, analysts say.Although boosting market share and brand awareness, VW’s race for volume has triggered a costly proliferation of models and equipment, especially in its core passenger-car brand where profit margins have languished amid growing inefficiencies.With over 310 models and nearly 120 factories worldwide, VW’s size may be turning into a disadvantage, forming the backdrop to a leadership crisis in April when ex-chairman Ferdinand Piech was ousted after publicly criticizing CEO Winterkorn.VW’s top management has since been trying to regain the initiative, though other top players, notably its unions and stakeholder Lower Saxony, are seeking to influence the course of its move to a leaner structure as VW is pushing 5 billion euros of cost savings in its core division.Wolfsburg-based VW last year started shifting its focus to boosting earnings quality to help fund growing technology needs and plant upgrades.VW has a goal of “moderately�� raising deliveries from last year’s record 10.14 million cars. The group will publish first-half results on Wednesday. ($1 = 0.9042 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and David Holmes)	-11.68343595
TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Japanese shares bounced back on Tuesday ahead of high-level Sino-U.S. talks this week to resolve a damaging trade war, with semiconductor-related firms leading the gains after Samsung flagged a slightly better than expected third-quarter profit.The benchmark Nikkei average ended up 1.0% at 21,587.78 points, while the broader Topix added 0.9% to 1,586.50, though trading volume was below average as many investors remained on the sidelines before the key trade talks.Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is due to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday, but hopes for a deal dimmed on Monday after President Donald Trump said a quick agreement was unlikely.Overnight, the dollar rallied against the yen from a low of 106.55 yen to as high as 107.465 yen, providing a boost for shares of Japanese exporters as a weak yen enhances corporate profits when they are repatriated.Among blue-chip exporters, Toyota Motor Co gained 1.5%, NIDEC advanced 2.8% and Omron Corp added 2.4%.Semiconductor-related shares made gains after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics flagged slightly better than expected third-quarter profit, helping to ease investor concerns about the smartphone market.In Tokyo, Sumco jumped 3.8%, Advantest soared 4.4% and Screen Holdings climbed 3.7%.Investor sentiment was also helped by solid moves on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets after a one-week holiday in China.By sector, precision machinery, metal products and oil &amp; coal products were the top three performers among the Tokyo bourse’s 33 sector subindexes, up 2.2%, 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co 7201.T said on Thursday they would expand a recall previously issued in North America to the rest of the world to replace potentially deadly passenger-side air bag inflators made by Takata Corp 7312.T.Toyota said it would recall another 2.86 million vehicles across 24 models produced between April 2003 and December 2008, including 1.729 million in Europe, 360,000 in Japan and 190,000 in China. Toyota on June 16 recalled 1.37 million vehicles in the United States after Takata agreed to comply with an order by U.S. regulators to declare more inflators defective and expand the recalls.Nissan said it was calling back 198,000 vehicles including the Navara, Caravan, and Teana built between April 2007 and December 2008, after a corresponding recall in the United States and Canada previously.The cause of the potential defect in these recalls remains unknown. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries from the expanded recalls, both automakers said.	-2.283680581

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Indian unit has temporarily closed its two plants where some workers had stopped production lines to protest a delay in salary hikes after 10 months of negotiations.The factories near Bangalore are Toyota Motor’s only vehicle plants in the world’s sixth-biggest auto market, where the Japanese manufacturer generates just a sliver of global sales.Their closure raises the specter of labor unrest at Indian car plants in recent years, including a 2012 dispute at Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS. A riot left one person dead and over 100 injured, and resulted in a $250 million month-long production loss.Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), the world’s biggest car maker’s Indian unit, in a statement said some workers over the past 25 days had disrupted business as the management, labor union and local government negotiated wages.“The company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel,�� TKM said.The subsidiary closed the factories on Sunday - a non-production day - and did not state when it will reopen them.Closure would result in a daily production loss of 700 vehicles, said Toyota Motor spokesman Naoki Sumino in Tokyo.TKM and the union will continue holding talks to resolve the issue, Sumino said.Shares of Toyota Motor were down 0.1 percent at 0531 GMT in Tokyo, in line with the benchmark Nikkei index .N225.India accounted for just 1.6 percent of Toyota Motor’s global sales last year. At that time, the Japanese manufacturer held 4.5 percent of the Indian market having made 174,000 vehicles and sold 147,000.Subsidiary TKM has been building cars at one of the locked-out plants since 1997 including the Fortuner and Innova, and at the other since 2010 including Etios and Corolla Altis.The lockout comes just a week after Toyota Motor gave Japanese workers their biggest pay increase in 21 years, and two months after the automaker said social unrest in Thailand could lead it to rethink investment.	-1.987891931
LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Multinational car dealer Inchcape said on Friday it would return surplus cash to shareholders by buying back 100 million pounds ($151.6 million) of its stock over the next year after reporting solid first-half results.The London-based firm, which sells and distributes cars for manufacturers such as Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and BMW in 26 countries, said revenue in the six months to June 30 was up 6.6 percent to 3.3 billion pounds, boosted by the acquisition of Australian automotive group Trivett.While it wants to be able to continue to invest in both organic growth and further acquisitions, Inchcape said it wanted to avoid holding excess cash.“The board concluded that there is scope to return surplus cash to shareholders,�� it said in a statement.Reporting first half profit before tax up 10.7 percent to 147 million pounds, Inchcape said it would pay an interim dividend of 5.7 pence, up 43 percent year-on-year.“We continue to expect the group to deliver a robust performance in 2013 despite competitive pressure on vehicle margins in some of our markets,�� it said.	-7.466686518
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said on Wednesday it is recalling 361,000 older vehicles worldwide for potentially defective air bag inflators.The defect involves a different type of Takata inflator than those that have prompted the largest-ever auto safety recalls worldwide covering more than 42 million U.S. vehicles by 19 automakers with Takata air bag inflators.Honda Motor Co 7267.T said on Tuesday it will recall 2.7 million older U.S. vehicles in North America for the same type of Takata inflator that Toyota is also recalling. Takata issued a new defect notice in November for inflators from four automakers, including Honda and Toyota.Toyota’s new recall covers some 1998-2000 Toyota RAV4, 1998-1999 RAV4 EV, 1998-1999 Celica and 1997-1998Model Year Supra vehicles with a non-azide front driver airbag inflator, including 139,000 in the United States.The notice came after BMW recalled more than 200,000 vehicles in the United States for the same type of inflator after the death of a driver in Australia from an air bag rupture involving one of the inflators, along with two other injury incidents in Australia and Cyprus.In total, at least 25 people have been killed and 290 injured from the inflators, which can explode when deployed and spray deadly metal fragments. U.S. regulators say the cause of the inflator explosions is propellant breaking down after long-term exposure to high temperature fluctuations and humidity.	-5.990493499

DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T luxury brand Lexus topped a U.S. vehicle dependability study of owners of 3-year-old cars and trucks as model-year 2010 vehicles improved to record-high quality levels.The industry’s cars, introduced in 2009 when the sector was hitting a 28-year sales low during the recession, saw a 5 percent improvement in quality, falling to 126 problems per 100 vehicles from 132 last year, according to the J.D. Power and Associates survey released on Wednesday.Lexus led with a score of 71 problems per 100 vehicles.“The continuous improvement in long-term dependability means consumers should have more confidence in three-year-old vehicles, whether they are keeping their current vehicle or shopping for a used car,�� David Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power, said in a statement.Vehicle dependability is important to automakers because fewer problems translates into more loyal customers. J.D. Power said that 54 percent of owners who don’t experience any problems with their vehicles stay with that brand for their next purchase. That loyalty rate slips to 41 percent when three or more problems are experienced.Twenty-one of the 31 brands measured improved their scores in the survey, with U.S. domestic nameplates improving at a slightly greater rate than imports. The domestics narrowed their scoring gap with imports to 10 problems per 100 vehicles with an overall average of 133, from a gap of 13 last year.In 2009, U.S. auto sales hit their lowest level since World War Two when, adjusted for population, and both Chrysler and General Motors Co GM.N underwent government-sponsored bankruptcies and Ford Motor Co F.N borrowed heavily to avoid the same fate. Chrysler Group is now controlled by Fiat FIA.MI.Following Lexus, which led for a second year in a row, were Porsche PSHG_p.DE (94 problems per 100 vehicles), Ford's luxury Lincoln brand and Toyota (each at 112), Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz brand (115) and GM's Buick (118). Lincoln was the top ranked brand in the 2011 study.Rounding out the top 10 were Honda Motor Co's 7267.T namesake and luxury Acura brands (119 and 120, respectively), and Chrysler's Ram pickup truck and Suzuki 7269.T (122 each). Mazda 7261.T and GM's Chevrolet brand also scored lower than the industry average at 124 and 125, respectively.The bottom five scoring brands in the survey were Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE (174 problems per 100 vehicles), Chrysler's Jeep brand and Mitsubishi 7211.T (each at 178), Chrysler's Dodge (190) and Tata Motors Ltd's TAMO.NS Land Rover brand (220).Among individual models, the Lexus RX had the highest dependability in the industry with just 57 problems per 100 vehicles, marking the first time in the survey a crossover or SUV topped the list, J.D. Power said. Chrysler’s Ram scored the biggest improvement, cutting its problems by 52.Toyota, through its namesake and Lexus brands, saw its vehicles earn seven segment awards, while GM had four and Honda, and its Acura brand, led in two segments.	0.2240841777
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Japan’s Diamond Electric Manufacturing Co Ltd has agreed to plead guilty and pay a $19 million criminal fine for a conspiracy to fix prices of ignition coils sold to Ford Motor Co and other companies, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.Diamond is the 10th auto-parts maker to agree to plead guilty in the Justice Department’s long-running investigation into price-fixing in the industry.Separately, an executive with Autoliv Inc, Takayoshi Matsunaga, agreed to plead guilty in connection with a conspiracy to fix the prices of seat belts sold to Toyota Motor Corp, the Justice Department said.Matsunaga, who pleaded guilty to a single felony, is the 15th executive to acknowledge breaking the law as part of the probe.Diamond Electric, which agreed to assist the Justice Department, agreed to plead guilty to a single felony charges of fixing the prices of ignition coils sold to Ford, Toyota Motor Corp and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, the Justice Department said.The department said the price fixing conspiracy ran from at least July 2003 to at least February 2010.The nine auto parts makers that have already pleaded guilty are Tokai Rika, Autoliv, TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, Nippon Seiki Co Ltd, Fujikura Ltd, Furukawa Electric Co Ltd, Denso Corp, Yazaki Corp and G.S.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese car imports declined 87.1 percent in June from a year earlier to 15,000 vehicles as automakers delayed shipments before tariff cuts on foreign-made vehicles took effect last month, according to an industry association.The data from the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), which was reported by local media on Monday, also showed that overall sales of imported cars during the first half of 2018 fell 22.1 percent year-on-year to 451,971 vehicles.CADA published the June data last week and has yet to release July figures.In May, China announced that it would steeply cut import tariffs for foreign-made automobiles and car parts to 15 percent from 25 percent from July 1.It, however, in July raised tariffs on cars imported from the United States to 40 percent amid rising trade tensions with Washington.“June was the most impacted month,�� said Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association’s import committee.“Many car dealers held back their import orders and decided not to import until July 1,�� he said.China imported 1.25 million cars last year, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.The tariff cuts announced in May prompted many automakers such as Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T to say at the time that they would look at adjusting their retail prices in China to provide competitive offers to customers. However, firms affected by the higher duties on cars imported from the U.S. such as BMW AG BMWG.DE and Ford F.N later decided to take a profitability hit rather than raises prices fully on U.S.-produced SUVs.	-6.481481481
(Adds background on the indictment, probe)WASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Two executives from Japanese auto parts manufacturers have been indicted as part of the U.S. Justice Department’s long-running investigation into price-fixing in the auto parts industry, the government said on Friday.Hiroya Hirose, who works for NSK Ltd, and Masakazu Iwami of Jtekt Corp were indicted on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on charges of conspiring to fix the prices of bearings sold to Toyota Motor Corp, the department said.In September, Jtekt and NSK agreed to plead guilty to price-fixing and to pay criminal fines.Thirty auto parts makers have either pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty to price fixing or other violations of antitrust law. These include Toyoda Gosei Ltd,, Autoliv Inc, G.S Electech, Tokai Rika Co Ltd and TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH.In addition, 46 people, including Hirose and Iwami, have been charged with price fixing as part of the probe, the department said.In its indictment, the Justice Department said that Iwami and other unnamed co-conspirators began to rig bids to sell bearings to Toyota in about 2001, and that Hirose joined the conspiracy in 2006. It went until July 2011, the department said.Efforts to reach Hirose and Iwami, who are based in Japan, through the companies were not immediately successful.

SEOUL, Jan 7 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Hyundai Motor on Thursday unveiled its first dedicated gasoline-electric vehicle, becoming one of a handful of automakers to challenge Toyota Motor’s Prius as low oil prices weigh on demand for fuel-efficient vehicles.The automaker said the compact car, named the IONIQ, achieved world-class fuel economy of 22.4 kms (13.92 miles) per litre. There is no equivalent number for the latest Prius, which has not been launched in Korea yet.Hyundai said the IONIQ would be rolled out in mid-January in Korea with a starting price of about 22.9 million won ($19,145), similar to the basic version of its Sonata mid-sized sedan.The launch comes as slumping oil prices have cut petrol prices, encouraging drivers to switch from fuel-sipping cars to gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. Toyota, which dominates the gasoline-hybrid car market, last month trimmed its global sales target for the new Prius to 300,000-350,000.The IONIQ featured a 1.6-litre engine with a thermal efficiency of 40 percent, a measurement of how well an engine converts the burning of fuel into motive power, Hyundai said. The fourth-generation Prius also has a thermal efficiency of 40 percent.The IONIQ is the world’s first car to offer three different electrified versions, including plug-in hybrid and full electric cars.Hyundai has so far launched hybrid variants of their existing models like the Sonata and the Azera, but this is the first time it has made a hybrid-exclusive car.Affiliate Kia Motors also plans to launch its first hybrid-dedicated model this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators will unveil on Monday a voluntary effort to collect and make available nationwide data on existing autonomous vehicle testing.U.S. states have a variety of regulations governing self-driving testing and data disclosure and there is currently no centralized listing of all automated vehicle testing.California, for example, requires public disclosure of all crashes involving self-driving vehicles, while other states do not.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is unveiling the Automated Vehicle Transparency and Engagement for Safe Testing, or AV TEST, Initiative, to provide “an online, public-facing platform for sharing automated driving system on-road testing activities.”With many opinion polls showing deep skepticism among Americans about self-driving cars, the effort aims to boost public awareness. NHTSA plans “online mapping tools�� that will eventually show testing locations and activity data.Deputy NHTSA Administrator James Owens said in an interview that providing better transparency “encourages everybody to up their game to help better ensure that the testing is done in a manner fully consistent with safety.”Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Toyota Motor Corp as well as Cruise - General Motors Co’s majority-owned self-driving subsidiary - Uber Technologies Inc and Alphabet Inc’s self-driving company Waymo along with states including California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas are expected to take part, officials said.NHTSA’s goal is to “pull together really critical stakeholders to deepen the lines of communication and cooperation among all of us,�� Owens said, adding the effort was “an opportunity for the states to start sharing information among themselves.”NHTSA will hold events this week to kick off the initiative, including panels featuring companies involved in autonomous vehicle testing such as Nuro, Beep, Waymo, Uber and Toyota.Critics say NHTSA should mandate federal safety standards for automated driving systems.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in its investigation of the March 2018 death of a pedestrian in a crash with an Uber test vehicle, the first attributed to a self-driving car, said in November that NHTSA should make self-driving vehicle safety assessments mandatory and ensure automated vehicles have appropriate safeguards.Owens said NHTSA “will not hesitate�� to take action if it believes unsafe vehicles are being tested on U.S. roads, but it has not adopted NTSB’s recommendations.	-2.399691358
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T said on Monday they plan to trade expertise in parts supplies and R&amp;D, in an agreement that will aid expansion in emerging markets and help them cope with rapid technological sophistication.Any deal could see Toyota benefit from a supply chain that has helped Suzuki dominate India’s massive auto market, while Suzuki could hope to access Toyota’s innovations in automated driving, artificial intelligence and low-emission vehicles.“Toyota and Suzuki have agreed to work toward the early realization of a business partnership,�� they said in a joint statement, singling out areas of possible cooperation such as procurement and environment- and safety-related technology.They added that they saw no need to rush into a capital tie-up.The agreement comes about four months after Suzuki, Japan’s fourth-biggest automaker, said it was struggling to keep up with research and development (R&amp;D) in an industry simultaneously exploring non-petrol engines and self-driving vehicles - areas in which it has yet to announce any major strategy.While Toyota has the financial fire power to keep up with technology, the world’s second-largest automaker has long struggled to win market share in India where drivers prefer the type of affordable compact cars in which Suzuki excels.“There’s a lot we can learn from the speed at which Suzuki operates and implements changes,�� Senior Managing Officer Shigeru Hayakawa said at an earnings briefing, where Toyota also announced an upward revision to its full-year profit outlook.Suzuki, through a majority stake in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS, makes every other car sold in the country thanks in no small part to a local supply chain built up since the 1980s. Access to that chain could help Toyota make more cars tailored for India, and possibly compete with Suzuki in a market widely expected to be the world's third biggest by 2020.Toyota aims to double its share of India’s passenger vehicle market to 10 percent by 2025 helped by entry-level cars from minivehicle specialist Daihatsu, an affiliate wholly owned since last year which has yet to gain a presence in the market, a Toyota executive told Reuters last year.“We would be happy to share lessons we learned from our experience in India and emerging markets with Toyota if they wish, to make this a win-win partnership for both parties,�� Suzuki Vice Chairman Yasuhito Harayama said at a quarterly earnings briefing on Monday.Toyota is hoping to mine Suzuki’s know-how in low-cost design which has enabled its peer to come up with competitive cars priced below $7,000, according to several company insiders who have spoken with Reuters on condition of anonymity.In the past, Toyota asked Daihatsu for help in this area but its engineers and parts purchasing managers have told Reuters that establishing supply chains from scratch which can compete with Suzuki’s would be highly time-consuming.The courtship comes after Suzuki and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in 2015 ended a fraught partnership in which Suzuki accused the German automaker of wanting to bring its under its control, while VW objected to Suzuki's purchase of diesel engines from Fiat FCHA.MI instead of its own.Some analysts have questioned whether the latest partnership could see Suzuki compromise its dominance in India, along with its independence.��(Suzuki) needs access to technology, but would that mean giving up being an independent company?�� CLSA managing director Chris Richter said. “I think that’s a price too high for Suzuki at the moment.��	-1.332627306

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Saturday it may halt production at its domestic plants early next month due to a steel shortage, following an explosion at a steel plant operated by one of its affiliates.The blast an Aichi Steel plant has curbed production of steel parts, which may impact output at the world’s best-selling automaker which produces around 40 percent of its global output in Japan.“At the moment, there is enough supply inventory to keep our domestic plants running until Feb. 6,�� a Toyota spokesman said, adding that overtime and weekend shifts for next week had been canceled.“After that, we will be monitoring our supply situation on a day-by-day basis and decide accordingly.”Aichi Steel said that the Jan. 8 explosion at its Chita plant in central Japan dented production of special steel parts. It added that it aimed to resume operations in March.Toyota, whose vehicle stable includes the Toyota and Lexus brands, as well as Daihatsu Motor Co minivehicles and Hino Motors trucks, produced 4.0 million vehicles in Japan in 2015, roughly 46 percent of which were exported.A stoppage in production may impact Toyota’s plans to produce 4.13 million vehicles in the country this year, including its new Prius gasoline hybrid, which was launched in the United States this month and is produced solely in Japan.Toyota plans to build 10.2 million vehicles worldwide this year, after posting worldwide sales of 10.15 million in 2015, beating out Volkswagen and other automakers to keep its title as the world’s largest-selling carmaker.Toyota, which manufactures around 14,000 vehicles a day in Japan, would not comment on which components were supplied by steel made at the affected plant.	-13.53820598
* More than 80 percent not looking to lift base wages* Two thirds to raise bonuses but not base pay* For most, overall compensation won’t offset sales tax hike* Companies cite need to keep fixed costs downBy James TophamTOKYO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Fewer than one in five Japanese companies plan to raise base wages in the coming business year, a Reuters survey shows, a stark sign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus policies are still struggling to gain traction.Some big names, like Toyota Motor Corp, are expected to raise base pay, but the bulk of companies in the Reuters Corporate Survey say they will at most raise bonuses, which can easily be reversed if the economic recovery lapses.While bonuses account for an average 17 percent of a Japanese worker’s total compensation, the survey points to diminished purchasing power for many workers.Only 11 percent of firms said they plan to lift overall remuneration - bonuses plus any rise in base pay - by enough to cover a 3 percentage point rise in the national sales tax that takes effect April 1.Abenomics has spurred economic growth and sharp climbs in corporate profits with bold monetary easing and government spending, but economists argue that base pay hikes, along with more capital spending, are key to transitioning to a self-sustaining recovery.Since taking office in December 2012, Abe has publicly pressured big business to raise wages. Workers at major companies like Toyota, Hitachi Ltd, Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp are demanding higher base pay for the year from April.Toyota is likely to raise base pay for the first time in six years, according to suppliers for the carmaker. Toyota officials told reporters on Wednesday that nothing was decided as negotiations are still underway.But the survey, conducted Feb 3-17 for Reuters by Nikkei Research, indicates such largesse remains the exception as executives across a broad range of industries said they remain leery of raising fixed costs amid an uncertain economic outlook.“If we went ahead with a fixed increase in wages, we would not be able to respond to fluctuations in business conditions,�� wrote one executive at a wholesaler in a typical response.Of the 241 firms that replied to a question on their stance on salary negotiations, 66 percent said they would lift bonuses but not underlying compensation, while 16 percent plan no increases at all. That represents a slightly more encouraging stance than in September when 60 percent described their basic stance as to lift bonuses but not base wages, while 24 percent were not considering any pay increases.Shintaro Okuno, a partner at consultants Bain &amp; Co Japan, who reviewed the results of the survey, said Japanese firms, having developed a lean cost structure to cope when the yen was high, were loathe to give that flexibility up.“One of the few management (tactics) to counter instability of the future is to keep your fixed costs as lean as possible,�� he said.The results come just as worries mount that the Abenomics boost is fading. Japan’s economy, after leading the Group of Seven powers in the first half of 2013, skidded to annual growth of 1 percent in the second half, hurt by weakness in exports, private consumption and capital spending.Sentiment at Japanese manufacturers slipped in February for the first time in five months and is seen sliding further, the Reuters Tankan survey, taken alongside the corporate survey, showed.Concerns mentioned by executives in the comment sections of the corporate survey, included the impact of the sales tax hike on consumer sentiment, increased competition as well as rises in energy costs.The poll also showed deep-seated scepticism that the Bank of Japan can meet its goal of lifting the world’s third-biggest economy out of 15 years of deflation by next year.Given the headwinds, just 15 percent of respondents think prices will increase by 2 percent or more in a year from now, after stripping out the effect of the sales tax hike. Including the tax increase, however, 69 percent expect inflation to meet or beat the target.The Reuters Corporate Survey polls upper management at 400 companies each capitalised at more than 1 billion yen.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric cars, offering its strongest endorsement yet of a technology it has not embraced wholly, as take up of a rival technology it pioneered remains slow.Japan’s biggest automaker said on Thursday it will launch next month a unit that will start with four persons and be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations.The unit will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed.The announcement comes after Toyota, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles.Even as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve electric vehicles for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. Toyota has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years. But by adding longer-range models to its product range, it would be changing its tune from promoting FCVs and plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars as the most promising alternative to conventional cars.“The company’s position is changing. They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now,�� CASA analyst Chris Richter said.“It’s going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there,�� Richter said.The new unit would initially consist of one person each from the automaker and three group companies. These are machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp.“Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly,�� spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said.“With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.”Toyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050.	7.59448958
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Toyota Motor Corp official on Tuesday raised concerns about California’s plans to require compliance with a planned U.S. autonomous vehicle safety check list, calling it “preposterous.”Hilary Cain, director of technology and innovation policy at Toyota Motor North America, criticized California’s proposal to require automakers to submit the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) 15-point safety check list before testing vehicles.“If we don’t do what’s being asked of us voluntarily by NHTSA, we cannot test an automated system in the state of California. That is preposterous and that means testing that is happening today could be halted and that means testing that is about to be started could be delayed,�� she said at a Capitol Hill forum.On September 30, California unveiled revised rules that carmakers will have to certify that they complied with the 15-point NHTSA assessment instead of self-driving cars being required to be tested by a third-party, as in the original proposal.California would allow for the absence of a human driver and a steering wheel in advanced self-driving cars, provided there is two-way communication with the vehicle and NHTSA approval. California will hold a public hearing on the proposal October 19.President Barack Obama wrote a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette op-ed last month saying the administration is asking automakers “to sign a 15-point safety checklist showing not just the government, but every interested American, how they’re doing it.”Cain also raised concerns about whether the NHTSA guidelines are too vague. “The problem is there is going to be accountability and there is going to be enforcement,�� Cain said, saying in some areas NHTSA needs to offer more specific guidance. “We need to go through this with a fine tooth comb.”Former NHTSA Administrator David Strickland, who now represents self-driving advocates including Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co and Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], raised concerns at the forum about whether NHTSA has the expertise to review all of the data they are seeking on self-driving vehicles. Congress may need to “better resource the agency to deal with this new mission,�� he said.NHTSA has said it may need authority to conduct “pre-approval�� of self-driving technologies before they are marketed. Cain said “the approach is somewhat flawed�� and called for more conversation about how consumers can be assured that self-driving cars are safe.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told Reuters last month he strongly believes “we’ll get great compliance from the auto industry�� on voluntary self-driving guidelines.	-2.778983934
TOKYO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies is discussing the possibility of installing its self-driving system in Toyota Motor Co 7203.T vehicles as the U.S. ride-hailing firm seeks to sell its autonomous driving technology to outside companies, the Nikkei reported on Friday.Without citing sources, the Japanese business daily said that the firms are negotiating a possible deal for Toyota to use Uber’s automated driving technology in one of the automaker’s minivan models, and that Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had met with Toyota executives in the United States this week.Toyota, which is developing its own automated driving functions, has said it is open to collaborating with other firms to quickly bring new mobility technologies to market. It already has partnerships with Uber on ride-hailing and development of self-driving systems.“We regularly exchange information about automated driving with Uber for some time now,�� a spokeswoman said, adding that no decisions have been made beyond its existing partnership.Global automakers and tech companies are racing to develop self-driving cars as the rise of autonomous, on-demand vehicle services upends the traditional business model of personal transportation that is largely based on individual car ownership.As it battles with Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo to develop self-driving car services, Uber has been testing autonomous vehicles in the United States, and has been working with Volvo Cars and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE on driverless cars. In January, the Japanese automaker said it was working with Uber to develop a system of self-driving vehicles for tasks including ride hailing and parcel delivery.Toyota is an investor in Uber, and offers flexible vehicle leasing terms for Uber drivers. It has declined to comment on its size of its stake in the company.	-0.839042414
CHANGSHU, China (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T wants locally procured parts to make up at least half the components in the gasoline-electric hybrid propulsion systems for the Corolla and Levin cars it plans to start making in China next year.Shinichi Matsumoto, Vice President for Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing in China, said Toyota needs that level of local content in order to bring down prices of hybrids and to generate more sales in the world’s biggest auto market.Toyota, which currently pays costly tariffs and transport fees for bringing key components from Japan to assemble hybrid vehicles in China, aims to slash costs by using many locally procured materials and parts, Matsumoto told reporters on Tuesday.“My feeling is that unless the local procurement ratio reaches 50 percent, we can’t call it ‘localized��,�� he said at a research and development centre in Changshu, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Shanghai. He was referring to number of parts procured specifically for the hybrid system.“Ultimately, our goal is to localize 100 percent.”Matsumoto also said that using parts procured in China for its new hybrid cars does not mean it is lowering quality to pursue higher sales. Toyota plans to keep the system’s quality equal to that achieved in Japan, he said.The world’s biggest auto maker said this week that it will start manufacturing and selling Corolla and Levin sedans for China in 2015 with a locally made hybrid system including the battery and the motor, the first time it will make hybrids outside of Japan using key components procured locally.But made-in-China components does not necessarily mean made-by-Chinese companies. While localizing parts is going more smoothly than Toyota had expected, much of that output currently comes from Chinese units of Japanese parts makers with manufacturing operations in China, Matsumoto said.Toyota is also procuring from several Chinese companies, he said.In a gasoline-electric hybrid like Toyota’s Prius, a battery captures energy from the brakes to provide a supplement to the combustion engine, boosting overall mileage, particularly in stop-and-go city traffic.Toyota, which already assembles the Prius and Camry hybrids in China with component and system kits brought in from Japan, said it is trying to educate Chinese customers about hybrid technology. For instance, some people think they must be re-charged like electric vehicles, which is not the case.While Toyota is not the only firm trying to localize production of the hybrid system, it is the furthest ahead.Honda Motor Co 7267.T is also trying to start procuring key components in China, including motors and lithium-ion batteries, Takahiro Hachigo, an executive at Honda's Chinese operations, said in a news conference in Beijing on Sunday. The firm plans to start making hybrid cars in China by 2016.“As corporate average fuel emission standards get stricter, we believe that hybrids will become the mainstream among green cars,�� Seiji Kuraishi, Honda’s Operating Officer and COO for the China region, told the same news conference.In Japan, the Prius�� starting price is around $20,500 before subsidies. In China, the car starts selling at $36,900 and most buyers do not receive subsidies except in certain cities.Toyota said on Tuesday that it sold 26,800 hybrid vehicles in China in 2013, up 55 percent from a year earlier. It has not said how many hybrids it aims to sell in China in the future. ($1 = 102.5700 Japanese Yen, 6.2274 Chinese Yuan)	1.377716135

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday filed a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, alleging that its rival bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.GM also alleged that Fiat Chrysler’s former chief executive, the late Sergio Marchionne, was central in the scheme.The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will seek “substantial damages�� from FCA that it said would be reinvested in the United States to create jobs, but did not specify an exact amount.The lawsuit comes at a delicate time for FCA, which is working on a planned merger with French automaker PSA and is negotiating a four-year labor contract with the UAW.FCA said here late on Wednesday that it would defend itself vigorously against the lawsuit.“We are astonished by this filing, both its content and its timing,�� FCA had said in a statement earlier. “We can only assume this was intended to disrupt our proposed merger with PSA as well as our negotiations with the UAW.”FCA and PSA last month announced the planned 50-50 share merger to create the world’s fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand.GM’s general counsel, Craig Glidden, told reporters at GM’s headquarters that the lawsuit has nothing to do with the planned merger of PSA and FCA and the automaker does not intend to file suit against the UAW.PSA declined to comment.The UAW has targeted FCA last out of Detroit’s three automakers for contract talks. UAW workers at Ford Motor Co ratified a new contract last week, while GM workers approved a deal in late October that ended a 40-day U.S. strike.“It (the lawsuit) can’t help but complicate the already difficult task of getting a UAW-FCA agreement in place,�� said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Michigan.The UAW said in a statement, “We are confident that the terms of those contracts were not affected�� by the actions of FCA or UAW officials. It said it was “regrettable�� that these issues can cause doubts about the contracts.The lawsuit also names as defendants three former FCA executives who have pleaded guilty in an ongoing federal probe into the UAW and FCA. GM said that probe, coupled with its own investigation, resulted in the lawsuit.GM’s Glidden said a “pattern of racketeering�� by FCA from 2009 to 2015 left GM paying higher wages than Fiat Chrysler, and allowed the latter to use more temporary workers and lower-paid second-tier workers than GM.“As part of this bribery scheme, and to lock in the competitive efficacy of the purchased benefits, concessions and advantages for FCA, GM was denied similar union commitments and support,�� the lawsuit states.The lawsuit claims that among the “benefits, concessions and advantages illegally purchased by FCA�� was UAW support for “World Class Manufacturing,�� a version of Toyota Motor Corp’s lean production strategy but adapted to the culture of Italian automaker Fiat.That system has been credited in part for helping to turn around struggling operations like FCA’s plant in Toledo, Ohio, that makes the popular and profitable Jeep Wrangler.The suit also claims that after a failed bid to take over GM in 2015, FCA corrupted the collective bargaining process by structuring terms through bribed UAW officials that “forced unanticipated costs on GM.”The lawsuit says that under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), FCA would be liable to pay GM three times the actual damages caused, plus interest, punitive damages and attorneys�� fees.GM alleges that FCA, under the leadership of former CEO Marchionne, used bribes to UAW officials to corrupt the collective bargaining process from 2009 through 2015. Marchionne died in 2018.Fiat took control of Chrysler after it emerged from a U.S. government-funded bankruptcy in 2009.“Marchionne was a central figure in the conceiving, executing and sponsoring of the fraudulent activity,�� Glidden said.When GM rejected a merger bid from FCA, the lawsuit alleges Marchionne conspired to negotiate a new four-year contract “designed, through the power of pattern bargaining, to cost GM billions.”The UAW has been the focus of a spreading federal corruption probe.Gary Jones, the UAW president who recently had taken a leave of absence, on Wednesday resigned effective immediately just hours after the union said it would seek to remove Jones from office, a union source told Reuters.Jones�� lawyer Bruce Maffeo told the Detroit News the decision was based “on his belief that his continuing to serve will only distract the union.�� A UAW spokesman could not confirm the resignation.Last week, the UAW’s acting president unveiled a series of reforms designed to prevent further scandals.Glidden said the automaker supports those reform efforts.	-0.1266357113
TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co 7267.T said strong car sales in the United States and Japan offset a slowdown in Thailand in the three months to September, helping the Japanese carmaker post a 46 percent growth in quarterly net profit.Honda reported stronger-than-expected demand for its remodeled Fit subcompact that went on sale in Japan in September, a key model in its ambitious plans to boost global sales.The company aims to boost worldwide car sales by around 1.5 times to 6 million vehicles by end-March 2017.Strong sales in the United States and Japan helped Honda post a quarterly net profit 120.4 billion yen ($1.2 billion), compared with 82.2 billion yen a year ago, though that was lower than the average estimate of 134.9 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of six analysts.Honda car sales in Japan rose 2.6 percent from a year ago in July-September to around 179,740 vehicles, helped by a jump in September after the Fit went on sale.The higher-than-expected demand caught parts suppliers by surprise, and the company has a backorder of more than 60,000 Fit vehicles, Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura said.Japan is the first country where the redesigned Fit went on sale. Honda will start operating a new plant in Mexico in spring 2014 to manufacture the Fit, which will go on sale in the United States around the same time.Honda, the fifth biggest carmaker in the United States, sold 413,434 vehicles in the U.S. market in July-September, up 13.1 percent from a year ago, helped by strong sales of the Accord and the Civic.Conversely, business in Southeast Asia’s biggest auto market, Thailand, has slowed after an incentive program for first car buyers ended.Even though Honda sold the most number of passenger cars in Thailand in January-September, surpassing Toyota, its July-September sales fell 21.8 percent from a year ago to 45,480 vehicles as customers cancelled vehicle orders.That accounted for some 4 percent of Honda’s global sales of 1.047 million vehicles in July-September.The rate of drop was smaller than rival Toyota’s 30.4 percent fall and Nissan’s 25.4 percent decline.“We expect Thailand to continue growing steadily, but the growth rate will drop,�� Iwamura said.Globally, Honda kept its car sales forecast for the year ending March 2014 at 4.43 million vehicles.Honda also said that it would sell its electronic parts subsidiary to Japan's Nidec Corp 6594.T, a maker of precision motors. It declined to give the price of the deal, though the Nikkei business daily reported earlier that it would be sold for about $500 million.Honda is the first of Japan's big three automakers to announce quarterly results. Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Japan's second-biggest carmaker, said on Wednesday that it is moving its earnings date to November 1 from November 5, while market leader Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will announce on November 6.($1 = 98.0900 Japanese yen)	-4.110647504
BEIJING, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Sales in China by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and its two local joint-venture partners fell 5 percent in July from a year earlier to about 78,400 vehicles, according to a company spokesman.For the first seven months of this year, the Japanese auto maker sold a total of about 520,800 vehicles, a 19.2-percent increase from the same period last year, said the Beijing-based spokesman, Takanori Yokoi.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it was expanding its safety recall involving Takata Corp front passenger air bag inflators to cover about 601,300 additional vehicles in the United States. [toyota.us/2CV24Wl]Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after it said it was recalling more than 100 million of its air bag inflators worldwide through the end of 2019 because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments.Air bags with the inflators have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 20 deaths, mostly in the United States including one in Louisiana that was identified last month.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Saturday posted a notice from Takata that said the company would recall another 3.3 million inflators for vehicles from automakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, Daimler AG, General Motors Co, Tata Motors Jaguar Land Rover unit and Subaru Corp.NHTSA said in November that 19 automakers had recalled 46 million inflators in 34 million U.S. vehicles -- and by 2019 as many as 70 million U.S. inflators will have been recalled. In June, the agency said only about 35 percent of vehicles recalled have been repaired to date.In January 2016, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the inflator ruptures.	0.1246334311
EditorsNote: adds IndyCar statementPagenaud takes controversial Long Beach winLONG BEACH, Calif. -- Simon Pagenaud won his first IndyCar Series race with Team Penske on Sunday amid controversy.Pagenaud crossed a blend line too early exiting the pits and received only a warning despite the fact doing so helped him get ahead of Scott Dixon for what essentially was the race win on Lap 56 of 80. That was the last scheduled pit stop of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach.Dixon and his team were upset with race control’s decision, saying IndyCar officials specifically said such an act would be penalized.However, Dixon’s strategist, Mike Hull, acknowledged that IndyCar did not say what the penalty would be. Another driver, Carlos Munoz, also was warned for crossing the yellow line near Turn 1.Indeed, the rulebook is clear, but the penalty sheet is not. IndyCar gives its stewards -- former Ford Racing executive Dan Davis and former drivers Arie Luyendyk and Max Papis -- latitude in making a decision. A minor violation can be overlooked. The next levels are a driver going to rear of the lead lap, followed by a drive through the pits.Pagenaud was issued neither of those.“It shouldn’t be a judgment call; it’s a rule,�� Dixon said.IndyCar later issued a statement that read, “Simon Pagenaud’s actions during the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach were deemed an infraction per Rule 7.10.1.1. ‘Lane Usage�� of the IndyCar Penalty Guidelines: Failing to follow designated procedures entering or exiting the pit area, including the proper use of the acceleration and deceleration lanes. The penalty for this infraction ranges from a warning (minimum), putting the driver to the back of the field (mid) and drive-through or stop and go/hold (maximum). IndyCar race stewards determined his actions were not severe enough to warrant a harsher penalty than the warning that was issued.”Dixon’s car owner, Chip Ganassi, said NASCAR would have solved this problem electronically so no judgment would enter into the discussion.“There’s a camera there, and the camera makes the call electronically,�� Ganassi said of NASCAR. “So, we’ll see. Maybe it’s an opportunity (for IndyCar) to improve.”Pagenaud argued that it was a close call, even a gray area, and it didn’t help him get in front of the charging Dixon.“A yard the other way wouldn’t have mattered,�� he said.Pagenaud held off Dixon, last year’s winner of this event, the rest of the way for a 0.3032-second victory, the fifth of his IndyCar career. He won two races in each of the 2013 and ��14 seasons for what is now Schmidt Peterson Motorsports.Pagenaud also is the series leader, by 14 points, in his second season with Roger Penske’s team.Helio Castroneves, the pole winner, led 47 laps and finished third. All three of the top finishers are part of the Chevrolet program.Pagenaud’s teammate, Juan Pablo Montoya, also got a favorable review from race control. Late in the race, a potential block on Takuma Sato was not called as such. Montoya took fourth, Sato fifth as the top-finishing Honda.The caution-free race was the first for this event since 1989. It also went flag to flag without incident in 1985 and ��87.The last IndyCar race to go the distance without a caution was the 2013 race at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.	-1.770510836
APASEO EL GRANDE, Mexico (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T will ramp up production at its new Mexican plant to 100,000 vehicles a year by 2021 in a major step to shift production of its popular mid-size Tacoma pickup truck to Mexico from the United States, the company said on Thursday. The plant in the central state of Guanajuato, along with an older facility near the U.S. border, will bring Toyota’s Mexican production to 266,000 trucks a year when at full capacity, Japan’s largest automaker said.Toyota said it expects to send 95% of pickups from the two plants to the United States, where the automaker sold nearly 249,000 Tacomas last year, up 1.3%.“Tacoma production will be concentrated right here in Mexico,�� Christopher Reynolds, a chief administrative officer for Toyota in North America, said at an event to inaugurate the Guanajuato plant. “What this means is that the Mexican manufacturing facilities of Toyota will build all the Tacomas that serve the mid-size pickup segment in the North American market.”Toyota said last month it will move Tacoma production from the United States to Mexico as it adjusts production around North America. It said the decision would “improve the operational speed, competitiveness and transformation at its North American vehicle assembly plants based on platforms and common architectures.”Asked about the possibility of angering U.S. President Donald Trump with the decision to move Tacoma production to Mexico, Luis Lozano, head of institutional relations for Toyota Mexico, said, “We don’t make business decisions based on politics. We are a company that thinks about the very long term and that we’re going to be here long after many people have gone.”Lozano noted that Toyota maintains a big production footprint and employs more than 30,000 workers in the United States.Toyota has pumped $700 million into the Guanajuato site, which began operating last December. Toyota began making Tacoma trucks in 2003 at its plant in Mexico’s northern border city of Tecate, where last year it turned out close to 167,000 pickups.Automotive exports from Mexico fell for the first time in a decade last year, dragged down by weak demand from outside the United States, and industry groups project another drop in 2020.Lozano said the company will not need to make major supply changes on the back of the new regional U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade accord that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump had criticized.One of the biggest changes requires increased North American content in cars and trucks built in the region - to 75% from 62.5% under NAFTA - with new mandates to use North American steel and aluminum.In addition, 40% to 45% of a vehicle’s value must come from “high wage�� areas paying workers at least $16 an hour, namely the United States and Canada, a provision aimed at slowing the industry’s migration to lower-wage Mexico. Vehicles that fail to meet the standard would be subject to U.S. tariffs.“We don’t have to make very large adjustments within our value chain in North America because for a long time we have had a value chain which is very deep, very sophisticated and very integrated,�� Lozano said.“It is not an issue that will require greater efforts or investments to comply. We will fulfill it to the letter.��	-13.73471969
* Pole sitter Chase crashes out early* Race favorite Earnhardt Jr. crashes late* Toyota sweeps top three spots (Adds quotes, detail)DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. Feb 21 (Reuters) - Denny Hamlin won the Daytona 500 in an electrifying photo-finish over Martin Truex Jr. on Sunday to put Toyota in Victory Lane for the first time at the Great American Race.Matt Kenseth had looked poised to add his name to the short list of three-time Daytona 500 winners when he led inside the final half-lap, but instead it was his Joe Gibbs Racing team mate who passed Truex only a few feet from the finish line to claim victory by a wafer-thin 1/100th of a second, the smallest margin in the 58-year history of the race.Kyle Busch, who gave Toyota their first NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers title last season, was third, to give the Japanese company an unprecedented sweep of the Daytona podium.“This was a team victory. My team mates did an amazing job all day, working together,�� said the 35-year-old Hamlin as he celebrated his first Daytona 500 win.“This is a proud moment for everyone at Toyota. It was my 11th try at getting the Daytona 500.“I don’t know where that came from. I don’t even know what I did, but it just all came together. I just got the push.”Hamlin had led almost half the race but with one lap to go sat fourth before making a daring push to the front, brushing past 2009 and 2012 winner Kenseth, who lost control and dropped back into the pack before regaining control.“They don’t get any more crushing than that,�� said Kenseth. “We were unbelievably fast and that was the position I want to be in.“I saw Denny was fast enough and I felt he was going to go around me if I didn’t block him. I tried to get in front of him to get some momentum and I couldn’t do it and got sideways there.“We went for it and came up short.”With Kenseth out of contention, it was a sprint to the checkered flag and Hamlin, second in 2014 after Dale Earnhardt Jr. passed him on the final lap, erased that disappointment by going one better this time.“I did all I thought I could do,�� offered Truex. “I had the lead 20 feet from the line.“I’m really proud of that effort. He just side drafted me. I probably should have run him up a bit more, but I thought we were close enough.“Congrats to Denny. He got me by a couple feet.”Rookie Chase Elliott, son of twice Daytona 500 winner and NASCAR Hall of Famer Bill Elliott, got his career off to a spectacular start by becoming the youngest ever Daytona pole sitter.And the 20-year-old coolly led the 40-car field to the green flag as the massive crowd at the iconic Speedway, which underwent a $400 million renovation, jumped to its feet and cheered.Elliott, taking over the coveted seat in the Hendricks Motorsports number 24 Chevrolet left vacant when three-time Daytona champion Jeff Gordon retired at the end of last season, also brought out the first caution of the day on lap 20 of the 200 lap race when he lost control and spun into the infield, ripping the nose off the car.With 30 laps left, pre-race favorite Earnhardt’s day came to a crunching end when he slammed hard into the infield wall, bringing out the fifth caution of the day.“We really under-estimated how important handling was going to be today,�� said Earnhardt. “We were starting to move forward, getting aggressive and just lost it.�� (Writing by Steve Keating in Toronto.

TOKYO (Reuters) - In the rush toward electric vehicles, automakers are increasingly sparing a thought for the humble delivery van, an often overlooked segment with big growth potential given tightening pollution restrictions in urban areas.Given lingering consumer concerns about cost and charging infrastructure, many in the industry expect it will take at least a decade for electric vehicles (EVs) to win over mainstream car owners.But as e-commerce begins to dominate the retail sector and cities clamp down on pollution, more vehicle makers see opportunities for faster take-up of EVs as delivery vehicles, taxis and other business uses in dense, urban areas.At the Tokyo Motor Show which opened to the public on Friday, Nissan Motor Co, an early embracer of EV technology and maker of the Leaf, the world’s top-selling electric car, unveiled a concept model of its e-NV200 electric van with refrigeration capabilities, designed to transport chilled food to restaurants and homes.“Imagine if you have city access challenges, how will you get food delivered to restaurants, and goods to customers?�� said Ashwani Gupta, head of the light commercial business at the automaking alliance of Nissan and France’s Renault SA.“There’s no other option but to go electric.”Nissan plans to launch the refrigeration model in Japan next year, Gupta said. Both Nissan and Renault already market electric vans in Europe.Nissan is also looking to introduce the e-NV200 series in China in the near term as it expects demand will “explode�� as big cities in the country effectively ban gasoline and diesel trucks and vans in an effort to crack down on emissions.At the moment, the country’s electric light commercial vehicle market has yet to be tapped by major foreign automakers, although Ford Motor Co wants to drive its truck-making China partner Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) more toward electric commercial vans.Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, majority owned by Germany’s Daimler AG, has also begun selling its eCanter electric light-duty truck in the United States, Europe and Japan, where it targets transport delivery services and convenient stores.As increases demand for e-commerce creates more work for delivery services, Toyota Auto Body, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp, was thinking about the harried delivery van driver when it designed its LCV D-Cargo concept model.“We set out to make the delivery truck more comfortable for drivers,�� said Ichiro Mukai, who worked on the model’s design.“In the past home deliveries mainly centered around larger parcels, but recently, a big increase in the number of deliveries has come just as people are getting smaller parcels delivered,�� he said, adding that this had increased the workload of drivers.The model’s futuristic design is based on Toyota’s gasoline-hybrid minivan models marketed in Japan, and can be adapted to operate as an all-battery electric.Removing the passenger seat entirely, the driver’s seat configuration - which includes a retractable steering wheel and rounded seat corners - is designed to enable drivers to get in and out of the vehicle more quickly and easily.A removable tablet device in the center of the steering wheel enables drivers to easily locate parcels in the hold, where track shelving units and a wider door opening allows for easy access to parcels from outside the vehicle.	1.2782378
LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Nissan will review its decision to build the Qashqai SUV in northern England if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, potentially leading to the closure of the Sunderland plant, the Financial Times reported.The vast site holds a symbolic position in the UK after former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lured Nissan there in 1986, beginning a recovery in British car-making after its near collapse in the 1970s.Britain’s big carmakers, all foreign owned, had urged Britons to vote to stay in the European Union in the 2016 referendum and have warned ever since that they will struggle to operate if the normal European trade arteries are disrupted.All carmakers rely on supply chains that run across Europe, bringing components to factories on a just-in-time basis.In the months after the 2016 vote the then prime minister, Theresa May, struck a deal with Nissan to keep it in Britain, promising extra support in written assurances that Brexit would not hit the Sunderland plant’s competitiveness.Former Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who was involved in those negotiations, has since been fired by Nissan.The FT quoted three people with knowledge of the matter as saying that the decision to build the Qashqai in Britain had been contingent on a so-called “soft�� Brexit that included a smooth transition.“While we don’t comment on speculative scenarios, our plans for Qashqai production in Sunderland have not changed,�� a company spokesman said.Nissan has already cancelled plans to make the next model of its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, saying in February that uncertainty over Brexit was making it harder to plan for the future. It decided to produce the vehicle solely in Japan.Britain has already delayed two deadlines to leave the bloc and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to deliver Brexit at by the end of October, with or without a deal, alarming companies that rely on trade routes to operate.Japanese companies including automakers Honda and Toyota have long seen Britain as the gateway to Europe.The Nissan spokesman said that frictionless trade had enabled the Sunderland plant to become the biggest factory in the history of the British car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU.“Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and EU will look like,�� he said.	6.35886514
TOKYO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it would aim to bring to market cars that can autonomously change lanes, merge with traffic, and overtake other vehicles on highways by around 2020 as it aims to catch up in the nascent field of self-driving cars.Demonstrating its newest safety technology features to media on Tuesday, Japan’s biggest automaker said in that car of the future, drivers would be able to turn on and off the auto-pilot mode with a single switch.Toyota also said it would launch three models in Japan this year equipped with “intelligent transportation system�� (ITS) technology, which allows vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication to alert drivers to potential dangers using sensor technology.The face-lifted Crown sedan unveiled in the domestic market last week was the world’s first car to use ITS technology, Toyota said. The fourth-generation Prius hybrid, due for launch in Japan at year-end, will be among the three models, it said.	0.1711351968
(Repeats April 17 story for wider distribution.)NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - Major automakers are bullish on the outlook for the U.S. economy and auto sales, but one big question remains - will President Donald Trump throw a grenade into the sector by imposing sweeping tariffs of up to 25 percent on car and auto parts imports?The industry is in “wait-and-see mode,�� but the tariffs would be a bad idea, Bob Carter, head of U.S. sales at Toyota Motor Corp, told Reuters on Wednesday.“If the tariff happened on the auto industry, quite frankly that’s pulling the pin out of the grenade,�� he said at a conference on Tuesday held in conjunction with the New York International Auto Show. “I don’t believe the U.S. economy can run out of the room fast enough if that happens.”Carter said in an interview he was optimistic the Trump administration would decide against tariffs, yet “uncomfortable�� given the president’s decision last year to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.Trump ran for office in 2016 on a protectionist platform aimed at shoring up U.S. manufacturing jobs. He has said in the past he was considering tariffs on autos and auto parts of up to 25 percent.In February, the U.S. Commerce Department sent recommendations to Trump, which auto industry officials expect to include at least some tariffs on fully assembled vehicles or on critical technologies and components related to electric, automated, connected and shared vehicles.Such tariffs would have a deeper impact on car prices and consumers than earlier metals tariffs that were imposed. The steel and aluminum tariffs cost Detroit automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co $1 billion each and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said they could add up to $350 million in costs in 2019.Trump is supposed to make a decision by mid-May, but some officials think the administration will find a way to delay final action, using the threat as leverage to try to win concessions on autos in trade talks with Japan and the European Union.Joe Eberhardt, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover North America, said a 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles would cost the company “billions.�� If the tariffs were on parts, it would also hit U.S. automakers hard, he noted.“We just hope that reason will prevail,�� he said.Toyota and other automakers have been lobbying heavily to block any new tariffs on imported vehicles, arguing the industry’s global supply chain is so intertwined that tariffs would raise prices, hurt sales and thus damage the economy.At a conference held ahead of the New York auto show this week, IHS Markit’s chief U.S. economist, Joel Prakken, forecast 2019 U.S. new vehicle sales of 16.8 million units, down about 500,000 units from 2018 but still high historically.However, tariffs could reduce sales by another 2 million vehicles and shave half to two-thirds of a percentage point off U.S. gross domestic product, he said.“It would be horrible for the automotive industry, it will be horrible for consumers and it will be horrible for the U.S. economy,�� said Fred Diaz, the U.S. chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors Corp.In one example, Carter said 72 percent of the parts for the Camry sedan that Toyota makes in Kentucky come from U.S. suppliers, but 28 percent are imported. A 25 percent tariff would cause that car’s price to rise $1,800 overnight.“There is no such thing as a 100 percent U.S. vehicle,�� he told Reuters.According to industry estimates, broad tariffs could add an average of $4,000 to a new car’s sticker price.Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s North American chairman, Jose Valls, said the automaker has “invested very heavily in the U.S. and they (the Trump administration) need to take into account our customers and our employees.”�We’ll adjust,�� Valls said. “But we’re not taking decisions on things that haven’t been finalized yet.”Mitsubishi’s Diaz said industry groups are lobbying hard against the tariffs.“The feedback is that we’re being heard,�� he said. “But fundamentally, how do you really know?�� (Reporting by Nick Carey and David Shepardson in New York Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)	-4.872744845
(Repeats Nov. 21 story with no change to text)* U.S. Attorney’s Office for SDNY probes Hyundai, Kia - source* The probe comes on top of NHTSA investigation* NHTSA says “active�� probe under way over Hyundai engine issuesSEOUL/WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating if Hyundai Motor and affiliate Kia Motors�� vehicle recalls over engine defects were conducted properly, according to a person with knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by Reuters.The South Korean firms, together the world’s No.5 automaker, recalled nearly 1.7 million vehicles in 2015 and 2017 in the United States in one of their biggest recalls in the country, citing an engine failure that increases the risk of a crash.The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), part of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), has launched a criminal investigation, the person told Reuters.It remains to be seen whether the probe will lead to charges, the person added. If criminal charges are filed, it could lead to hefty fines for Hyundai and Kia.The DoJ is coordinating with the U.S. transport regulator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), on the investigation, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter is confidential.Nicole Navas Oxman, a DoJ spokeswoman, declined to comment.“The Justice Department generally does not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on the existence or non-existence of an investigation,�� she said in an emailed statement to Reuters.The United States has previously investigated and imposed strict penalties on other automakers such as Toyota Motor and Volkswagen AG.In 2017, a U.S. judge dismissed a criminal charge against Toyota here after it completed three years of monitoring under a $1.2 billion settlement in which it admitted to misleading the public about sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles.The settlement was the largest penalty levied by the United States on an auto company until Volkswagen admitted to diesel emissions fraud and paid $4.3 billion in fines in 2017.Apart from the SDNY probe, Hyundai and Kia are also the subject of an investigation by NHTSA into whether their recalls covered enough vehicles and were conducted in a timely manner.NHTSA has “active�� investigations into engine issues related to certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles, the regulator told Reuters.“These investigations are ongoing - no final conclusions have been reached,�� it added.Hyundai declined to comment on the SDNY probe.An investigation by U.S. prosecutors will add to Hyundai and Kia’s woes at a time when they are grappling with sluggish sales in the United States and China.The pair have already set aside roughly 1 trillion won ($885 million) in 2017 and 2018 to cover costs mainly stemming from recalls over engine problems.In the United States, Hyundai recalled 470,000 Sonata sedans in 2015 due to the failure of “Theta II�� engines. In 2017, it expanded its U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe sport utility vehicles, citing the same engine issue, the NHTSA said.Kia also recalled 618,160 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles which use the same engine in the United States.However, Kim Gwang-ho, an engineer at Hyundai and a company veteran of 26 years, told NHTSA that the companies should have recalled more vehicles in 2015, citing an internal report.

TOKYO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it would recall a combined 361,800 vehicles globally, including the Camry sedan, covering three separate defects.Subject to the recalls are 170,000 Camrys to fix a faulty ball joint that could cause a loss of control of the vehicle. Europe accounts for the majority with about 120,000 vehicles, followed by 40,000 in Japan, Toyota said.Another recall covers 105,800 Hiace, Regius Ace and Dyna models, mainly in Japan, to replace the fuel pipe. The third recall is for 86,000 Crown and Crown Majesta models in Japan to replace the outer seat belt assemblies.Toyota said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths from the three recalls.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Two of Japan’s smaller automakers reported huge gains in quarterly profit on Monday citing strong sales in Asia, at a time when their bigger peers are struggling for growth in the United States, a key market for Japanese cars.Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T, Japan's fourth- and seventh-largest automakers, have limited presence in the U.S. where competition has seen peers Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T resort to costly buying incentives.But their vehicles resonate well in Asia, with Suzuki’s cars and motorcycles continuing to dominate in India while Mitsubishi’s latest model has won over drivers in Indonesia.Suzuki, on track for record annual earnings, booked a 68 percent on-year jump in October-December operating profit, saying growth also came from Japan and Europe.At Mitsubishi, Asian sales and a weaker yen helped profit more than double from a year earlier, when sales dropped following the automaker’s admission that it had overstated the mileage of some models.Mitsubishi also said it now expects a 19-fold jump in profit to 95 billion yen ($865.13 million) for the full-year - a year in which its latest model, the seven-seat Xpander launched in Indonesia last year, has so far helped sales jump 25 percent in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Sales also rose 51 percent in China, a market where Mitsubishi sees sales more than doubling under its mid-term plan through 2019.“Some markets are unstable, but we believe that the ASEAN market is stable,�� Chief Finance Officer Koji Ikeya said at a briefing. “We want to use new vehicle models to lift sales further in the region.”Mitsubishi also raised its full-year dividend forecast to 17 yen per share from 14 yen.Suzuki, which makes the Baleno compact hatchback and the Vitara Brezza compact sport utility vehicle, reported ongoing strong sales in Asia, particularly in India where it dominates the market through a majority stake in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS, the country's largest automaker.Boosted by strong sales in Asia, Suzuki and Mitsubishi are more upbeat about profit prospects than those more reliant on the slowing U.S. market. North America accounts for around 16 percent of Mitsubishi’s sales, whereas Suzuki no longer sells vehicles in the United States, the world’s second-largest auto market. That compares with 30 to 40 percent of sales at Toyota, Nissan and Honda.Last week, Honda raised its full-year operating profit forecast, but the upgrade still represents a 7.8 percent slide from a year prior. While the automaker is seeing explosive growth in China, it has been saddled by stagnant sales in the United States.Toyota, which reports earnings on Tuesday, has said it expects annual profit to be largely flat compared with a year earlier, whereas Nissan - which owns 34 percent of Mitsubishi - has forecast a 13 percent decline.($1 = 109.8100 yen)	-6.630152782

The stock has surged 42.5 percent since the company’s $500 million initial public offering in April of last year.The 14.3 billion peso ($350.5 million) selldown was more than three times oversubscribed, GT Capital said in the filing. The deal will increase the company’s free float to about 40 percent from 30 percent.GT Capital plans to use most of the proceeds from the primary issuance to fund the 9 billion peso purchase of a 30 percent stake in Toyota Motor Philippines, which was announced in October 2012.UBS acted as sole bookrunner on the deal, GT Capital said.

* Weak U.S. data take toll on exporters* Automakers hardest hit, led by Nissan Motor and Toyota Motor* Some traders suspect the market has bottomed out for nowTOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks edged down on Tuesday morning as weak data from the United States took some of the shine off recent evidence suggesting a reasonably healthy pulse in the world’s biggest economy - Japan’s major export market.The Nikkei share average declined 0.2 percent to end the morning session at 17,106.54.The smaller fall in the market was taken by some as a sign that the market may have bottomed out for now.“The selling that we’re seeing this morning has been pretty tepid,�� said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.“I think we’re pretty much done with the serious downward pressure we’ve seen and it would be a fairly dangerous time to be short on the market with so many Japanese companies poised to announce share buybacks.”U.S. economic data released overnight showed consumer spending barely rose in February and inflation retreated, suggesting the Fed could remain cautious about raising interest rates this year even as the labor market tightens.The United States is a big market for many of Japan’s globe trotting firms and with growth slowing in China - another huge trading partner - investors are betting on some upside in the world’s no. 1 economy.Japan’s automakers, which rely heavily on U.S. export sales, were among those hit hard in early trade. Nissan Motor Co Ltd slipped 1.8 percent, while Toyota Motor Corp fell 1 percent and Isuzu Motors Ltd declined 1.9 percent.Electronics and machinery company Hitachi Ltd fell 1 percent, and electronics components maker Alps Electric Co Ltd shed 2.6 percent.Furniture store operator Nitori Holdings soared 7.9 percent after the company raised its earnings outlook and its dividend.Industrial machine maker IHI Corp surged 7 percent after announcing that it expects a special profit of about 18.7 billion yen ($164.67 million) for the year ending March 2016.The broader Topix fell 0.3 percent to 1,377.94 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 declined 0.2 percent to 12,453.05.	-4.974619289
BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's 7267.T joint venture with GAC Group 601238.SS2238.HK will invest 3.27 billion yuan ($469 million) in new-energy vehicle production in China, GAC said in a stock exchange filing on Wednesday.The move is part of Honda and GAC’s push to meet China’s stringent green car quotas.The Honda-GAC joint venture will build a new plant with capacity to produce 170,000 new-energy vehicles a year, the filing said. New-energy vehicles include all electric battery cars as well as plug-in hybrid vehicles.A source close to the joint venture said that the plan envisages Japan’s Honda producing GAC’s Trumpchi GS4, a battery powered compact SUV, to sell through Honda outlets operated with GAC.The Honda-produced car is likely to be sold with the Trumpchi badge rather than Honda’s, the source said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the matter.It is a highly unusual arrangement but provides a quick way to meet Beijing’s requirements for such vehicles to represent 10 percent of an auto manufacturer’s production by 2019.The deal is similar to an earlier one between Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and its local partner. Toyota showrooms will sell an electric vehicle without the Japanese company’s distinctive triple-oval logo. Instead, it will feature the label of its Chinese partner GAC and be built using GAC’s lower-cost technology.($1 = 6.9717 Chinese yuan renminbi)	4.936278675

SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp temporarily halted production at its sprawling San Antonio pickup truck plant on Wednesday due to storm damage at the facility, which was hit by lashing rain and strong winds, a company spokesman said.The plant sustained some roof damage that allowed water to enter the plant, Toyota Motor Manufacturing of Texas spokesman Mario Lozoya said. Production would be halted at least into Thursday, he added.The problems began when a major storm blew through the region earlier in the day, knocking out electrical power at the plant, according to Lozoya.“Now that we have some power back in some areas, we are starting to see the real damage, and a lot of it is water-related,�� Lozoya said.He says the first shift was told not to report on Wednesday, as managers went through the 2.2 million-square-foot (236,800- square-meter) facility inspecting the damage.“Our concern is that there may be water in the electrical systems,�� Lozoya said. “We want to make sure those things are safe.”The National Weather Service said the area south of San Antonio, where the plant is located, reported winds of about 80 miles per hour (130 km per hour) during the storm, which dumped drenching rain and hail across the San Antonio area.The Toyota plant, which opened about a decade ago, employs 2,600 people and builds the company’s full-sized Tundra pickups and mid-sized Tacoma pickups.The trucks sold in Texas can come with a sticker reading “Born in Texas, Built by Texans.��	6.214235519

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government is planning to offer ample support to popularize fuel cell vehicle technology as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co prepare to launch hydrogen-powered cars in 2015.The government on Thursday drafted a timeline that spelled out targets and actions over the next 25 years to commercialize fuel cell vehicles and boost use of hydrogen energy in general.The move comes as Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party considers supporting the technology through subsidies and tax breaks, so that by 2025 fuel cell vehicles can sell for around $20,000 or a little more, the same price as popular gas-electric hybrids.A fuel cell vehicle, which runs on electricity generated from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen, emits only water vapor and heat. The vehicles can run five times longer than battery-operated electric cars, and their hydrogen tanks can be filled in just a few minutes.But they are expensive, and the lack of fuelling infrastructure could get in the way of a successful commercialization. In Japan, just a handful of hydrogen fuelling stations have been built due to strict safety regulations, high costs and the unclear outlook for demand.The government aims to cut the price for building a hydrogen fuel station by half to around 200 million to 250 million yen ($2 million-$2.45 million) by 2020, the draft showed.Japan also aims to have around 100 hydrogen stations in operation by end-March 2016, up from 17 now, the draft said.The timeline, which will be finalised in about a week, does not include fuel cell vehicle sales targets or details on how much in incentives will be offered to car buyers.Separately, the ruling party, which is also compiling policy recommendations to boost hydrogen energy use, is considering annual sales targets of 40,000 fuel cell cars by 2020 and 400,000 by 2030, a draft showed.Toyota, which plans to start selling its new fuel cell car next year in Japan, the United States and Europe, aims to popularize the technology as it did the Prius, which it launched in 1997 to become the world’s top-selling hybrid vehicle.The company, which is set to brief reporters on June 25 about its fuel cell vehicle development, has said the car could be priced as low as around $50,000 excluding subsidies. The Prius hybrid starts from around $21,600 in Japan before tax breaks.	0.3721874471
(Adds quote, detail, background)JAKARTA, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp will boost annual capacity at its Karawang plant in Indonesia by 50,000 cars to 120,000 cars in a bid to keep up with growth in Southeast Asia’s top economy, a senior official at the firm told Reuters on Wednesday.The automaker said it would invest an additional 15 billion yen ($195.11 million) in the facility due to the increase.Domestic car sales in Southeast Asia’s largest economy stood at a record 894,180 cars in 2011, up 16.9 percent from the previous year, supported by the lowest ever interest rate and a growing middle class..“With many manufacturers planning to substantially increase their capacity, it implies that the industry is bullish about Indonesia’s automotive market,�� said Leonardo Henry Gavaza, an analyst at Bahana Securities in Jakarta.Indonesia’s domestic car sales surpassed those of Thailand in 2011, a fact that helps explain the increase in direct investment in the sector, Gavaza said, adding that car sales in 2012 will likely be flat or lower than in 2011 because of the higher base.But sales should reach 1 million cars this year and 8.8 million motorcycles if the government drops its plan to raise fuel prices and if a separate plan to increase by 30 percent the down payment rate for car loans is dropped, he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The self-driving car joint venture of SoftBank Corp and Toyota Motor plans to begin operating in Southeast Asia next year, in its first overseas foray, its chief executive said on Tuesday.The move would mark a shift for Japan’s third biggest telco as it looks abroad for growth and potentially bring it into competition with portfolio companies of parent SoftBank Group Corp and its $100 billion Vision Fund, which has invested in major ride-hailing firms around the world.Monet, which is developing an on-demand self-driving service platform, is planning to export a basic version of the system, Chief Executive Junichi Miyakawa told Reuters.“Our first step will likely be to Southeast Asia, as applications like transportation services in smart cities, or airport shuttle systems,�� Miyakawa said, adding that Monet could begin introducing such services in 2020.Monet is the first-ever alliance between Japan’s No. 3 telco and its largest automaker. SoftBank Corp is the largest shareholder in the venture, which was announced last October, with a 40.2% share, while Toyota owns 39.8%.It plans to roll out on-demand bus and car services in Japan in the next year, and a services platform for electric vehicles as early as 2023 based on Toyota’s boxy “e-palette�� multi-purpose vehicle.Honda Motor Co and Toyota’s truck making subsidiary Hino Motors took a roughly 10% stake each in the venture in March, and Miyakawa said that it would soon take more investment from the domestic auto industry.“We’re planning to announce an expansion in our stakeholders sometime this month,�� he said.Currently chief technology officer of SoftBank Corp, Miyakawa began looking for projects outside of its core telco business, which faces a mature market and shrinking population, on his return from a stint at SoftBank’s struggling U.S. wireless unit Sprint.The son of a Buddhist priest who is known for his frank style and big ideas like flying cellphone antenna company HAPSMobile, Miyakawa settled on the idea of developing a platform for autonomous cars after flirting with the idea of making cars.While Monet’s global ambitions will initially be limited to basic transport services, any expansion could eventually put it in competition with SoftBank portfolio companies, which include Uber Technologies , Didi Chuxing, Grab and Ola and the self-driving units of Uber and General Motors.Miyakawa, a key lieutenant of SoftBank Group founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, said he has no qualms about competing with those companies, adding that the knowledge of ride-hailing firms gained by SoftBank’s investing helps Monet develop its own services.“Monet is part of the SoftBank Corp camp (and not the Vision Fund),�� Miyakawa said.“As a company, we will go up against rivals which the Vision Fund invests in if it means we can provide the best services we can.”SoftBank and Toyota’s investments into those ride-hailing services could benefit Monet’s overseas expansion, one analyst said, as the companies could tap them for partnerships to help their entry into new markets.“If Monet were to enter the Chinese market, it could approach Didi; for the U.S. market it could partner with Uber, and collaborate with Grab in Southeast Asia,�� said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama.	1.61521324
JOHANNESBURG, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp shut a South African car factory on Wednesday due to a strike at parts suppliers Toyota Boshuku, which makes seats and door panels.“Lack of supplies has forced us to stop production,�� said spokesman Leo Kok.

GENEVA, March 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s automotive business in Europe will be profitable during its current fiscal year for the first time since 2007, Didier Leroy, the head of the Japanese automaker’s European operations, said on Monday.The company believes its car business will continue to be profitable during its fiscal 2013 year, buoyed by new models and the growing popularity of hybrids in Europe, Leroy said during a media roundtable a day before the opening of the Geneva car show.Toyota’s fiscal 2012 ends in March.Hybrids will account for at least 17 percent of its sales in Europe this year, he said, up from 13 percent in 2012.Analysts said the weak yen is now allowing the company to offer higher incentives on its models, while still maintaining a good profit margin. Leroy said the automaker is enjoying the benefits of the weak yen, but that this is not a part of the automaker’s long-term strategy.“We don’t want to build our business model on the currency situation,�� he told reporters.	2.255566312

WASHINGTON, April 26 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it was halting plans to install Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) technology, aimed at letting cars and trucks communicate with one another to avoid collisions, on U.S. vehicles beginning in 2021.Automakers have been divided in the United States over whether to proceed with the DSRC system or use a 4G- or 5G-based system.Toyota announced plans in April 2018 to begin the installation of DSRC technology in 2021 “with the goal of adoption across most of its lineup by the mid-2020s.”Automakers were allocated a section of spectrum for DSRC in the 5.9 GHz band in 1999 but it has essentially gone unused. Some Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and cable company officials want to reallocate the spectrum for WiFi and other uses. Testing has gone on for years to see if the spectrum band can be shared.Toyota said the decision announced Friday was based on “a range of factors, including the need for greater automotive industry commitment as well as federal government support to preserve the 5.9 GHz spectrum band for DSRC.”The Japanese automaker added that it would “continue to re-evaluate the deployment environment�� and but said it is still a strong backer of DSRC “because we believe it is the only proven and available technology for collision avoidance communication.”DSRC transmissions enable vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications and broadcast precise vehicle information up to 10 times per second, including location, speed and acceleration.General Motors Co backs DSRC and has installed the technology on a small number of Cadillac CTS sedans it has sold since 2017.In December 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed to mandate DSRC in all new vehicles. The Trump administration has not acted on the proposal.Last year, the acting head of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Heidi King, said the agency’s “past research has centered around DSRC �� because that was the only technology available.”She added that NHTSA was “exploring other technologies�� including cellular-based services that Ford Motor Co was pursuing, however.Ford said in January it planned to deploy cellular vehicle-to-everything technology,  or C-V2X��, in all new U.S. vehicle models beginning in 2022.Last year, FCC Commissioners Mike O’Rielly and Jessica Rosenworcel wrote Toyota urging them to examine “potential opportunities to advance automotive safety using newer technology, such as C-V2X systems�� when “committing capital expenditures to DSRC technology.”NHTSA has estimated that connected vehicles technologies could eliminate or reduce the severity of up to 80 percent of crashes not involving impaired drivers.The U.S. Transportation Department plans a meeting on Monday with automakers and state transportation officials about connected vehicle efforts and use of the 5.9 GHz spectrum, officials said Friday.

* Toyota, Honda, Nissan tumble* Suruga jumps retail investors seen short-covering - tradersTOKYO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks fell on Wednesday morning as automakers were hit by a sharp drop in U.S. new car sales last month while other stocks, including financials, retreated after a rally over recent weeks.The Nikkei share average declined 0.5 percent to 24,141.50 in midmorning trade, though it was still holding at 27-year highs.The weak yen trend paused as the Japanese currency attracted safety bids amid concerns over Italy’s budget plan.“Japanese shares are sensitive to global investors�� sentiment. Cyclical shares that rose over the past few weeks are prone to profit-taking,�� said Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.The auto sector was the worst performer on the board, falling 2.0 percent followed by insurers and banks which shed 1 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.Major automakers on Tuesday posted a hefty drop in U.S. new vehicle sales for September, in part due to a decline in sales in areas hit by Hurricane Florence and a tough comparison to the year-ago period when consumers rushed to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey.Sales in September 2017 were boosted by major replacement demand for water-damaged vehicles following Hurricane Harvey, which had flooded parts of southeastern Texas in August that year.Toyota Motor Corp declined 2.2 percent, Honda Motor Co tumbled 3 percent and Nissan Motor Co shed 1.6 percent.Financial stocks lost ground, with Dai-ichi Life Holdings sliding 2.0 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group falling 1.4 percent.Suruga Bank was volatile after sources told Reuters that Japan’s financial regulator will order the bank to halt some operations in the wake of improper lending on property investments.The stock jumped as much as 16 percent after slipping into the red in early trade, with traders saying that retail investors were seen covering their short positions after pricing in the bad news.The broader Topix fell 0.2 percent to 1,819.64.

EditorsNote: Adds ART; Edit 2: Cleared up quote, other minor tweaksDuring a press conference on Thursday, a very confident Brad Keselowski said he expected to lead a lot of laps, be up front and potentially win his fourth NASCAR Cup Series race of the season on Saturday night.Check, check and check.The Team Penske driver led a race-best 192 of 400 laps, finished 2.5 seconds ahead of runner-up Martin Truex Jr. and captured that victory No. 4 of 2020 on Saturday night in the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond Raceway.“It was quite a race here for us,�� Keselowski said. “Man, this thing (his No. 2 Ford Mustang) was awesome.”It was so awesome that it cost him a shot at putting on a smoke show after the win.Keselowski said it was the same car he used in his earlier victory in New Hampshire, so, he said, “I wanted to do a really cool burnout with it but I want this car for Phoenix (the mile track which will be the site of the season’s championship deciding race). It’s 2 for 2.”The victory gives Keselowski a guaranteed berth in the second round of the series playoffs where he will join Kevin Harvick of Stewart-Haas Racing, who won last weekend’s race at Darlington, and 10 others who will be determined next week.The victory was his second at Richmond, with the other coming in 2016.Truex never had a shot over the final laps at catching Keselowski.“Never could get the balance right,�� Truex, who was looking to win his third straight at Richmond, said. “Slow in the short run early, slow in the long run late. We just couldn’t put it all together. I was really surprised we were second after how it felt early in the race. I was like, ‘Oh boy, this is going to be a long night.’Finishing third at Richmond was Penske’s Joey Logano.Austin Dillon of Richard Childress Racing, who finished second a week ago, was fourth.Chase Elliott of Hendrick Motorsports came home fifth.“We were way better than we’ve been here,�� said Elliott, who was wrecked by Truex while going for the win a week ago. “So I thought that was a big improvement for us because we really need it here. This has been a really tough track for us.”All the drivers who finished in the top-10 were playoffs qualifiers.Saturday’s race was the second of three in the first round of the playoffs. The field of 16 drivers will be trimmed down to 12 after next weekend’s race at Bristol Motor Speedway.Defending series champion Kyle Busch had to start the race from the rear of the field after his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota twice failed pre-race inspections. Busch, who was slated to start in the sixth position, was looking for his first victory of the season.In addition, Busch was without his regular crew chief Adam Stevens, who was suspended when officials found that their car finished the Darlington race down two lug nuts.None of that mattered as Busch used a fast car and good pit stops to make his way up into the top five by the middle of the second stage. He wound up sixth.Finding themselves below the cutline after Saturday were William Byron (3 points out of 12th), Cole Custer (8), Matt DiBenedetto (25) and Ryan Blaney (27).Clint Bowyer is on the bubble heading to Bristol.--Field Level Media	-0.8372579801
(Adds Tata Motors and M&amp;M production cuts, share prices)BENGALURU, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Indian automakers Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&amp;M) said on Friday they would cut production at some plants in response to slowing demand that industry executives say has driven the sector into one of its worst downturns.Tata Motors, which had previously flagged a “challenging external environment��, said it closed some blocks at its Pune plant in the western state of Maharashtra.The company, India’s top automaker by revenue, had last month posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss due to weak conditions at home and problems at its British luxury car unit.M&amp;M said on Friday its automotive segment, which makes passenger and commercial vehicles and spare parts, would cut production for 8-14 days at various plants during the second quarter.Shares of Tata Motors and M&amp;M fell between 1.8% and 2.4% before cutting losses in a broader Mumbai market that was 1.3% higher as of 0720 GMT.The slowdown in the sector has triggered massive job cuts, with initial estimates suggesting that automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April, a senior industry source told Reuters earlier this week.The crisis has also hit smaller auto parts makers like Jamna Auto Industries Ltd. The company, whose customers include Tata Motors, General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp, said on Thursday it might shut all its nine plants in August due to weak demand.“In view of the weak customer schedule and high inventory, the company has made changes in production schedule at all its plants. The plants may not run or partially run on all working days in August,�� Jamna Auto said.Jamna Auto’s shares fell as much as 8.5% on Friday.Auto components manufacturers Bosch Ltd and Wabco India Ltd have already trimmed production amid the demand slump.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s government and top carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp, are joining forces to bet big that they can speed up the arrival of the fuel cell era: a still costly and complex technology that uses hydrogen as fuel and could virtually end the problem of automotive pollution.Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, unveiled its first mass-market fuel-cell car on Wednesday, which is due to go on sale in Japan by end-March next year priced at around 7 million yen ($68,600). A U.S. and European launch will follow in the summer.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth strategy, announced the day before, also included a call for subsidies and tax breaks for buyers of fuel-cell vehicles, relaxed curbs on hydrogen fuel stations and other steps under a road map to promote hydrogen energy.That will bolster plans by Toyota and Honda Motor Co, Japan’s No.3, to start fuel-cell vehicle sales in 2015.“This is the start of a long challenge to make hydrogen a standard feature in society and to make the fuel-cell vehicle an ordinary automobile,�� Toyota Executive Vice-President Mitsuhisa Kato told a news conference.With two of Japan’s three biggest automakers going all in on fuel cells, the country’s long-term future as an automotive powerhouse could now hinge largely on the success of what they hope will be a key technology of the next few decades.The auto sector carries special significance in Japan, providing nearly one in 11 jobs and about one-fifth of its manufacturing output. It is also one of the few big industries where Japan remains at the pinnacle of global competition after losing much of its edge in electronics and elsewhere.Japan’s ruling party is pushing for ample subsidies and tax breaks for consumers to bring the cost of a fuel-cell car down to about $20,000 by 2025. The government is also aiming to create 100 hydrogen fuel stations by end-March 2016 in urban areas where the vehicles will be launched initially.“To stay globally competitive, Japan cannot afford to lag behind in this area,�� said Yuriko Koike, a former environment minister who heads a group of ruling party lawmakers advocating hydrogen energy.A fuel cell vehicle, running on electricity from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen, emits only water vapor and heat. Hydrogen fuel production from hydrocarbons emits some carbon dioxide, although Japan hopes to implement carbon-free production by 2040.Hydrogen vehicles can run five times longer than battery-operated electric cars, and their tanks can be filled in just a few minutes compared with recharging times from 30 minutes up to several hours for electric cars.The challenges for fuel cell cars nevertheless remain daunting and growth could be slow, especially given the expense of building up an infrastructure of hydrogen fuel stations and the likely reliance on subsidies until costs come down.“Even after 10 years, fuel cell cars are likely to be less than 10 percent of the Japanese market,�� said Ryuichiro Inoue, a professor at Tokyo City University and an expert in the auto industry.“This isn’t a strategy to talk about for the next 10 years, but for the next 20 to 30 years.”Even Toyota only expects tens of thousands of fuel-cell cars to be sold annually a decade from now as the new technology will need time to gain traction.The government’s commitment to hydrogen vehicles in its growth strategy, however, shows how far the technology has come since Toyota and Honda began leasing fuel cell-powered cars in Japan 12 years ago. Japan had set out bold predictions, later abandoned as unrealistic, of putting 5 million fuel cell cars on the road by 2020.Engineers have since overcome a variety of technological challenges, including cold-weather ignition glitches due to water freezing and the need to reduce loadings of platinum - the precious metal that fuel cells use as a catalyst.Rivals such as South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co and Daimler AG are also producing fuel-cell vehicles, but Japan believes it will have an advantage after the UN adopted many of its proposals for global fuel-cell safety standards last June. This means it can avoid major changes to fuel cell specifications for exports, keeping costs low.Toyota, which astounded rivals 17 years ago by developing the Prius hybrid car in barely two years and then swallowed initial losses to establish its dominance in the segment, is confident of its prospects in fuel cells.“When we first introduced the Prius, there was little way we could make a profit and our vision was longer-term, for the second- and third-generation models,�� Toyota managing officer Satoshi Ogiso told Reuters in March.“Unless you are willing to accept losses initially, it’s not possible to increase sales.��	2.490437739
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission’s plan for a wifi-based standard for cars endorsed by Volkswagen faces a two-month delay as EU countries wait for legal advice on the proposal, giving a glimmer of hope to backers of the rival 5G technology.Envoys from the 28 EU countries met on Wednesday and agreed to extend their review of the Commission’s plan by two months after 15 countries asked for more time to allow the EU Council’s lawyers to examine the issue, people familiar with the matter said.The extension will kick in on May 13 following formal approval by EU countries on that day. The delay is not expected to derail the Commission’s proposal, with only Spain and Finland expressing concerns.Internet connected cars are expected to generate billions of euros in revenue for carmakers, telecoms operators and equipment makers once the market takes off.Last month EU lawmakers gave the thumbs up to a wifi-based standard, which primarily connects cars to other cars. Supporters include Renault, Toyota, NXP, Autotalks and Kapsch TrafficCom.Daimler, Ford, PSA Group, Deutsche Telekom, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung are lobbying for the 5G standard which hooks up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment, and has a bigger range of applications.Mobile telecoms operators lobbying group GSMA said there were a number of disputed points in the Commission’s proposal.“We expect the Council legal service (CLS) to be critical about this piece of legislation as it lays down a de facto mandate for wifi whereas the Commission should remain technology neutral,�� Joop Hazenberg, GSMA’s director, said.“There are also other strong doubts of the CLS on the Delegated Act, such as the Commission giving itself powers it does not have.”The Commission’s proposal can only be overturned with a blocking majority of EU countries.	4.422458989
(Adds details in paragraphs 3-5, 7-8)Jan 31 (Reuters) - The auto industry’s air bag troubles deepened on Saturday as U.S. federal safety regulators said three big automakers will recall about 2.1 million older vehicles to fix defects that could cause air bags to deploy when they are not supposed to.The vehicles involved in the recall announced by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are made by Toyota Motor Corp, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co.There have been about 400 reported cases of inadvertent air bag deployments in the recalled vehicles, NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said. The incidents have caused some minor injuries, but no known deaths, he told reporters.The agency said the recall concerned a defective chip in air bag systems and the fix involved replacing the entire air bag module, including circuits manufactured by parts maker TRW Automotive Holdings, Rosekind said.The auto makers involved had issued three earlier recalls to fix the chip problems. But the NHTSA said it had reports that 39 vehicles fixed under those actions had experienced inadvertent air bag deployments, hence the new recall.It was not related to millions of vehicles recalled over Takata Corp air bags. U.S. safety regulators have said defective Takata air bag inflators in certain vehicles can rupture and spray metal fragments inside the vehicle.Air bag failures were also central to the controversy last year over General Motors Co’s delay in recalling millions of vehicles with defective ignition switches, that could unexpectedly cut off power to the safety systems.Noting potential consumer concerns about air bags, the NHTSA said the chances of being involved in a crash in which an air bag could prevent serious injury or death were far greater than the risk of serious injury from an inadvertent bag deployment.The NHTSA blamed the problems it reported on Saturday on “electrical noise�� in the air bag system. It said a fully effective solution might not be available until late this year.The agency said the models affected were: 2002-2003 Jeep Liberty and 2002-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees (about 750,000 vehicles); 2003-2004 Honda Odyssey; and 2003 Acura MDX (about 370,000 vehicles) and 2003-2004 Pontiac Vibe; Dodge Viper; and Toyota Corolla, Toyota Matrix, and Toyota Avalon (about 1 million vehicles, not all of which were sold in the United States.)The agency said the affected models had a part called an electronic control unit that controls deployment of its air bags. TRW supplied control units containing the same control circuit to all three automakers.Although the recalls were not related to the Takata cases, the NHTSA said there was an overlap, in that about 1 million of the vehicles affected were also covered in separate recalls of Takata air bag inflator systems.The recall highlights the difficulty automakers and regulators have with increasingly complex electronic systems. The agency said in a statement it could take several months for the companies to get enough parts to fix all the vehicles involved.In the Takata cases, Honda on Friday said it has confirmed that a Takata air bag inflator ruptured in a Jan. 18 crash in Texas that killed the driver. Prior to that incident, air bags made by the Japanese company had been linked to at least five deaths. (Reporting by Joe White and Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Frances Kerry)	3.28781753
(Reuters) - Over the past 40 years U.S. states have been vying for new auto plants, with 17 states granting $17 billion in tax breaks, job training funds, infrastructure development and other incentives to woo investment from domestic and foreign automakers.Here is a list of the subsidies, provided by Good Jobs First, a Washington-based research group.Pennsylvania gave German automaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE $100 million in incentives in 1976 to locate its first U.S. factory in Westmoreland County.Michigan, home to General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and the U.S. unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI, has granted $7.8 billion since 1984 to the so-called Detroit Three, as well as to Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, when it was still allied with Ford. Far and away the largest subsidy was the $2.3 billion in state and local incentives given to GM in 2009 for its Orion Township plant north of Detroit, which builds the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Sonic.Nevada has provided $1.6 billion in incentives since 2014 to two relatively young automakers: $1.3 billion to Tesla Inc TSLA.O for its battery factory outside Reno and $335 million to would-be manufacturer Faraday Future for a since-canceled plant north of Las Vegas.Mississippi and Tennessee have provided $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, in subsidies to Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and VW.Nissan has solicited $1.8 billion in subsidies from both Mississippi and Tennessee. Toyota has pulled $836 million from Mississippi, Texas and Kentucky, while Honda Motor Co 7267.T won $389 million from Alabama and Indiana.Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, which controls Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS, has received $645 million in total from Alabama and Georgia.German automaker Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler AG 000270.KS, received $457 million from Alabama and BMW BMWG.DE $254 million from South Carolina.	-0.4468588452
DETROIT/NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp eliminated a huge obstacle with a U.S. settlement over unintended acceleration in its cars and trucks, leaving it to fight smaller cases that will be harder for plaintiffs to prove and less likely to damage the company’s growing sales.While the Japanese automaker still faces possibly hundreds of personal injury lawsuits related to claims that its vehicles accelerated unintentionally, Wednesday’s $1.1 billion settlement announcement will remove the last big roadblock to putting the issue behind it.Sean Kane, president of Safety Research &amp; Strategies and an outspoken critic of Toyota who has assisted plaintiffs�� attorneys against the automaker, said the settlement covered the biggest financial hit for Toyota.“Those are not billion-dollar cases,�� he said of the pending personal-injury lawsuits. “Those are at best million-dollar cases or multimillion-dollar cases. With a company like Toyota, that’s not even something that’s a blip on their radar.”At the time, the recall around the unintended acceleration issue and resulting lawsuits were a surprise for a company long associated with quality and reliability, and the resulting fallout led President Akio Toyoda to apologize publicly.Lee Kaplan, a product liability lawyer in Houston, said plaintiffs in the injury and death cases also will have an uphill battle in court because they will need to prove deficiencies in Toyota’s equipment.“I have never seen anyone identify the single cause of the problem,�� he said. “Without identifying a true scientific or technical basis, pinning a verdict on Toyota will be hard.”Toyota said it agreed to spend $1.1 billion to settle sweeping U.S. class-action litigation over claims millions of its vehicles accelerated unintentionally. The recall fallout related to the issue was a $2 billion hit to earnings in the company’s 2010 fiscal year.Judge James Selna is expected to review the settlement on Friday in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, California. However, final approval and disbursement of the money may not occur for several months.The proposed settlement will compensate customers for economic losses related to possible safety defects in Toyota vehicles, covering most of the litigation involving unintended acceleration.About 16 million Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles sold in the United States spanning the model years 1998 to 2010 are covered by the settlement. Company officials have maintained the electronic throttle control system was not at fault, blaming ill-fitting floor mats and sticky gas pedals. A study by federal safety officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and NASA found no link between reports of unintended acceleration and Toyota’s electronic throttle control system.Toyota, the No. 3 automaker in the U.S. market, admitted no fault in proposing the settlement, one of the largest U.S. mass class-action litigations in the automotive sector. One plaintiff’s law firm called it the largest settlement in U.S. history involving auto defects.However, the deal does not cover wrongful death or injury lawsuits, which according to a June Toyota filing totaled more than 300.Those cases will be handled by Toyota one by one, with the first slated to go to trial in February 2013 in Judge Selna’s California court, involving a Utah crash that killed two people. However, one wrongful death case in Houston was dropped last year due to lack of evidence and the largest such lawsuit, over the death of the family of off-duty California Highway Patrol officer Mark Saylor, was settled out of court for $10 million in late 2010.Toyota’s recall of its vehicles between 2009 and 2011 relating to the unintended acceleration issue hurt its reputation for reliability and safety.But the automaker’s sales were up almost 29 percent in 2012 through November, compared with a 14-percent increase in the industry, and Toyota’s share of the U.S. market has risen to 14.4 percent from 12.7 percent in 2011. Last year’s Toyota sales were depressed by the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan.The full effect of the acceleration issue on Toyota’s U.S. sales may not be known for years, until the current owners affected by it need to buy another vehicle.Yet with its U.S. sales rising at double the industry’s rate and the company expected to reclaim the global sales crown this year, analysts said Toyota has seemingly shaken off any lingering damage to its reputation.“Toyota is the Teflon company,�� Edmunds.com analyst Michelle Krebs said. “They always bounce back.“The consumer doesn’t seem to care,�� she added. “The consumer keeps on buying Toyotas.��	2.943412621
NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co Ltd on Wednesday unveiled an all-new Altima sedan, and demonstrated the auto industry’s problem adjusting new-model investments fast enough to keep pace with shifts in consumer demand.The Altima, and rival midpriced sedans such as Toyota Motor Corp’s Camry and Honda Motor Co Ltd’s Accord, used to be high-volume sellers, keeping assembly lines rolling full-time. All three automakers several years ago committed to significant redesigns of their sedans.Since those investments were made, demand for midsized cars has collapsed in the United States due to the growing consumer appetite for larger SUVs and pickup trucks. Sales of sedans made up 36.8 percent of the U.S. market in 2017, down sharply from 51.2 percent in 2012.Through February this year, sedans made up 33.3 percent of new-vehicle sales and are down 12 percent versus the same period in 2017.Jack Hollis, Toyota’s North American head of sales and marketing, said the automaker expects by the end of 2018 sedans will make up around 30 percent of sales.Last summer, Honda launched its all-new Accord, arguing that the well-reviewed sedan would help it maintain sales levels in a declining market. Instead, sales of the new Accord dropped nearly 16 percent in February from a year ago. Honda said that between April and June it will halt production at its Marysville, Ohio, plant for 11 days to reduce a high inventory of unsold vehicles.Nissan executives at the New York auto show on Wednesday said the new Altima has a chance to buck the trend.Nissan has added all-wheel drive, automatic rear braking and some autonomous features that help drivers stay in their lane or remain a set distance behind the vehicle in front to make the revamped Altima more attractive to consumers.“This (new Altima) sends a message that the sedan is back,�� Nissan’s senior vice president for global design, Alfonso Albaisa, said as he stood beside the new sedan onstage at the New York auto show.Rivals are shifting their investments to trucks and sport utility vehicles. Intensifying competition among automakers to sell sedans should lead to higher discounts and narrower profits, said car-shopping website Autotrader’s executive publisher, Brian Moody.“That’s good news if you want to buy a sedan because you should be able to get a good deal,�� Moody said.Johan de Nysschen, head of General Motors Co’s luxury Cadillac division, reiterated the company’s plans to cut the number of sedans in its family of vehicles, the smallest of which will be focused more on the Chinese market rather than U.S. consumers.Like other brands, Cadillac is adding sport utility vehicles and crossovers to its lineup.“Just as we are rebalancing our portfolio and reducing our number of sedan entries, so I imagine others will be doing the same,�� de Nysschen told Reuters on Wednesday. “The market just won’t sustain that many derivatives anymore.”The three big Japanese automakers, however, have large U.S. factories dedicated to midsized sedans such as the Altima, Camry and Accord.Toyota’s Hollis said Toyota remains committed to sedans.“We’re not pulling anything back, we will continue to invest,�� he said. “If other players want to pull out, fine, we’ll just take more market share.�� (Additional reporting by David Shepardson in New York Editing by Joe White and Matthew Lewis)	0.4678990565

Sabonis actually accomplished the feat prior to halftime, as his left-handed dunk in transition with 39 seconds remaining gave him 11 points at the time.Dallas�� Luka Doncic, whose last-second 3-point attempt didn’t go, finished with 36 points and 10 rebounds. Kristaps Porzingis endured a horrific night, making just 3 of 17 shots from the floor and misfired on all five attempts from 3-point range to finish with nine points.Brooklyn Nets 110 - Chicago Bulls 107Spencer Dinwiddie scored 24 points as Brooklyn overcame a season-high 29 turnovers and held on to beat visiting Chicago in the debut of interim coach Jacque Vaughn.The Nets won consecutive games for the first time since Feb. 10-12 and posted their third win in four games a day after mutually parting ways with coach Kenny Atkinson, who was 118-190 in three-plus seasons at the helm.LeVert and Harris scored 23 points apiece as Brooklyn finished with its most turnovers since moving from New Jersey following the 2011-12 season. DeAndre Jordan moved into the starting lineup and contributed a double-double with 11 points and 15 rebounds.New Orleans Pelicans 120 - Minnesota Timberwolves 107Jrue Holiday had a season-high 37 points as visiting New Orleans defeated Minnesota in Minneapolis.Holiday added nine rebounds and eight assists, Zion Williamson scored 23 points while Brandon Ingram had 15 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists.

Gilgeous-Alexander, who entered the game tied for the NBA lead in minutes played this season, was held out with a right hip contusion.Gordon Hayward returned to the Celtics�� lineup after missing two games with a right knee contusion. He led Boston with 24 points, hitting four 3-pointers. Marcus Smart had 19 points and 10 rebounds.Cleveland Cavaliers 132 - San Antonio Spurs 129 (OT)Andre Drummond scored 28 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as one of four Cleveland players with double-doubles as the Cavaliers outlasted the visiting Spurs in overtime to win their second game in as many nights.Rudy Gay’s jumper with one second left in regulation pulled the Spurs even at 118 and sent the game into overtime.Cleveland never trailed in overtime, grabbing the lead for good at 124-122 on Drummond’s putback layup with 2:18 to play. After a Spurs miss, Kevin Love hit a 3-pointer, and the Cavaliers held on as San Antonio missed five of its final six shots from the floor.Orlando Magic 126 - Houston Rockets 106D.J. Augustin scored 24 points and was one of six players to reach double figures for Orlando, who dismantled the reeling Rockets at Toyota Center in Houston.Nikola Vucevic (16 points, 16 rebounds) and Aaron Gordon (19 points, 10 rebounds) posted double-doubles to pace the effort on the interior for the Magic.

BEIJING, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have expelled the former chairman of state-owned China FAW Group Corp. from the ruling Communist Party, an anti-graft agency said on Thursday.Xu Jianyi, the former chairman, embezzled funds, took bribes and improperly advanced the career of his son, the party’s top anti-corruption commission said.China FAW is one of China’s top state-owned automakers, and has joint ventures with Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors in China.Xu came under investigation in March, the commission said.

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Corp 7201.T posted a steeper-than-expected 19.7 percent drop in quarterly operating profit on Thursday as a strong yen and costly sales incentives outweighed the impact of solid vehicle sales.Japan’s second-biggest automaker vowed though to meet its full-year operating profit target of 700 billion yen, pinning its hopes on revamps of existing models, such as the Altima sedan, to boost earnings.The company, 43 percent-owned by Renault SA RENA.PA, said it was confident of hitting sales growth targets in China but may struggle to increase sales in the fiscal year to March 2013 in Europe, where several countries are mired in recession.“It is true that progress is poor,�� Joji Tagawa, Nissan’s corporate vice president, said of the company’s performance in the April-to-June period, or Nissan’s first quarter.“We will be introducing new models in the second half of the financial year. Our internal plan is that while performance in the first half is rather slow, we will see growth in vehicle sales and profits in the latter half of the year ... It’s a matter of how much we can succeed in selling the new models, as well as how the yen moves.”Operating profit in April to June dropped to 120.7 billion yen ($1.5 billion), below the average forecast of 142.5 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net profit fell 15 percent to 72.3 billion yen from a year earlier 85 billion yen.Nissan’s earnings showed that the yen’s strength reduced operating profit by 25.7 billion yen. Increased sales costs, including incentives to sell older models in the United States, cut another 76.4 billion yen.Japan exporters have long bemoaned the steady rise in the value of the yen as it reduces their international competitiveness, including against South Korea automaker rivals, and eats into the income made abroad when converted into yen.Nissan kept its foreign exchange assumption for the financial year of 82 yen per dollar, a level the yen has achieved in only two weeks since the fiscal year began on April 1. Otherwise the yen has traded at higher levels.It rose to 78.14 per dollar on Thursday from more than 83 in mid March, an increase of 6.2 percent. Shares in camera maker Canon Inc 7751.T slumped on Thursday after it cut its profit forecast, citing the strong yen.Nissan also had penciled in a foreign exchange assumption 105 yen per euro, but the currency has traded at higher levels than that since early May.“With first-quarter profits weaker than expected, and Nissan already facing challenges from the strong yen and concerns in markets in China and the U.S., we’re unlikely to see any upward revisions late in the business year, like we’ve seen over the past few years from Nissan,�� said Koji Endo, analyst at Advanced Research Japan.Nissan started selling revamped models of its popular Altima sedans in the United States in late June and it plans to revamp others such as the Pathfinder sports utility vehicle later this fiscal year to try to boost sales.The quarterly results from Nissan are likely to look weak in comparison with domestic rivals Toyota Motor Corp 7201.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T.But that is largely because Nissan bounced back more quickly than its rivals from the Japan earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, so the annual comparison of its results is less flattering.Japan’s biggest automaker Toyota, due to report on August 3, is expected by analysts to report a net profit of 243 billion yen, compared to the 1 billion yen it booked a year earlier.Honda, Japan’s No.3 automaker, is likely to post a net profit of 144.8 billion yen, nearly five times its year-earlier result. It reports on July 31.Nissan sold 1.2 million vehicles globally in the three months to June, up 15 percent from the same period in the previous year. North America and China each accounted for about 28 percent of the total.Tagawa said that the firm is confident in hitting its target of 8 percent growth in vehicle sales in the Chinese market even though economic growth is slowing down.Vehicle sales in China for Nissan, Japan’s top-selling brand there, grew 10 percent in June from a year earlier, though an executive has said that increasing demand in inland areas is barely offsetting slowing demand in China’s coastal areas.The China new car market grew just 2.9 percent in the first half of 2012 after posting anemic growth of 2.5 percent in 2011, setting the country up for its slowest back-to-back years of growth since the market took off in the late 1990s.Tagawa described conditions for Japanese automakers in Europe as tough, saying Nissan may struggle to increase sales there this fiscal year.Its European sales fell 1.7 percent in the quarter from a year earlier. The company had said it wanted to boost European sales by 1 percent this fiscal year.Nissan said in May that it expected to sell 5.4 million vehicles globally in the year to March 2013, up 10.4 percent from the previous year.Under Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who was not present for the earnings presentation, Nissan has pushed into fast-growing markets like China and Russia.Since the start of the business year in April, shares in Nissan have dropped by around 19 percent, similar to a drop in Toyota. Honda’s shares have fallen more than 23 percent.On Thursday ahead of the results, Nissan’s shares ended at 707 yen, up 1.1 percent, which compared with a rise in the Nikkei average of 0.9 percent.(This story has been corrects in paragraph 17 to say Toyota reported a net profit of 1 billion yen in Q1 last year, not a net loss of 80 billion yen)	8.109182457
BEIJING (Reuters) - Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Nissan Motor Co. 7201.T are cutting back production in China in the wake of anti-Japan protests that shuttered dealerships and darkened their sales outlook in the world's biggest car market.Production slowdowns are a normal feature of the auto industry in mature markets like the United States and Japan, where they are used to keep inventories from ballooning and avoid pressure for automakers to offer deep discounts that erode profitability.But the steps by the Japanese automakers to cut output in China are an anomaly in a market that has driven the industry’s global growth over the past decade and where most automakers had been adding capacity until China’s economic slowdown in recent months. That caused production to outpace sales, resulting in larger-than-normal inventory levels at many car dealers.“For the time being I think you’re going to see Japanese automakers�� sales in China down by 20 to 30 percent,�� said Koji Endo, auto analyst at Advanced Research Japan.“The last time we had protests like this in 2010, the effects only lasted about a month, but I think this time is going to be different. This is going to have a serious impact.”There were also signs the tensions were having an effect on other sectors, most notably airlines, with All Nippon Airways Co Ltd (ANA) 9202.T announcing on Wednesday that 40,000 seat-reservations were cancelled for flights between Japan and China from September to November.Nissan, Japan’s top automaker in China, said it would halt production at a joint venture in China starting on Thursday, three days earlier than planned, and extending through next week’s national holiday period.Toyota plants in Tianjin and Guangzhou will also suspend production from Wednesday through the holiday, Tokyo-based spokeswoman Shino Yamada said, a few days earlier than planned. Production at factories in China may be further curtailed depending on market conditions, she said.As a result, a senior Toyota executive in Beijing said the company probably won’t be able to meet its goal of selling one million cars in China this year. In 2011, Toyota with its local Chinese partners sold about 900,000 cars in the country.“It’s very difficult to sell cars right now, but that’s true with every Japanese brand. Not just us,�� said the executive, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.In addition to Toyota and Nissan, Mazda Motor Corp.7261.T has decided to halt production in China on Friday and Saturday, giving workers two extra days off as part of the national holiday production shutdown.Suzuki Motor Corp. 7269.T said it also had stopped one of two shifts that it normally runs in China.Anti-Japan sentiment in China escalated earlier this month after Japan said it would buy a group of disputed island in the East China Sea, called Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan, from a private owner. It sparked the latest flare-up in tensions between the Asian neighbors that has smoldered since the end of the World War Two.In protests across China, angry demonstrators vandalized properties of Japanese companies, including a Toyota outlet in the eastern city of Qingdao that was torched.A senior Beijing-based Toyota sales executive said the long-term impact of the dispute on Japanese brands was uncertain.“Unlike before, when sales recovered fairly quickly, things seem very different this time,�� he said. “But it’s still very difficult to gauge what kind of long-term fallout we are going to have.”The executive, involved with sales and marketing of Toyota’s Lexus brand in China, said all Lexus outlets in China had reopened and are operating normally.“But customers are expressing fears about owning Japanese-branded cars,�� he said, “and that worries me a bit.”The latest auto production adjustments come on top of general cutbacks Japanese auto makers had been making prior to the protests. Global auto makers in general have been coping with slower-than-anticipated auto sales in China this year.China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in more than three years in the second quarter. A factory survey in August showed China’s manufacturing sector contracted at its sharpest pace in nine months.In the auto sector, Japanese auto makers had a roughly 19 percent combined share of China’s passenger car market in August before the protests. That was down from 20 percent in July, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Bin Wang said his checks with Japanese auto dealers in Guangdong province since the protests showed that sales were down on average by 60 percent, adding that the slowdown had boosted sales for German, American and Korean brands.Endo, at Advanced Research Japan, said he expected Japanese automakers would continue to adjust production if sales remain weak and could take measures such as cutting shifts or slowing line speeds to keep inventory from building.As a result, he said, parts suppliers in both China and Japan would have to cut output as well.	-1.665183679
TOKYO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s president said that it would be wrong for diesel use to fall as a result of the Volkswagen emissions scandal and that Toyota would continue to use diesel engines in vehicles where appropriate, such as in trucks.“Diesel has its merits, and it would be wrong if the ongoing scandal led to the end of diesel use,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters at the Tokyo Motor Show on Wednesday.Toyoda added that he was confident Toyota could be a leader in developing advanced automated driving technology.Earlier this month, the Japanese automaker said it would aim to bring to market cars that can autonomously change lanes, merge with traffic, and overtake other vehicles on highways by around 2020.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T said it is recalling around 200,000 hybrid SUVs globally including the Lexus RX400h, due to a glitch in the hybrid system's inverter.The Japanese carmaker also said on Wednesday it was separately recalling around 169,000 vehicles including the Lexus GS350 and IS350 due to a problem in the engine assembly process.No accidents or injuries have been reported in both cases, Toyota spokeswoman Shino Yamada said.Due to the hybrid system inverter problem, Toyota is recalling around 141,000 vehicles in North America, 37,000 vehicles in Europe and 15,000 vehicles in Japan.The recall affects Lexus RX400h SUVs made between March 2005 and June 2011, and Highlander SUVs manufactured between February 2005 and May 2007. Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand.Transistors used in the hybrids�� inverters could experience heat damage that could force the vehicles to stop, Toyota said in a statement.Toyota will replace a module inside the inverter, which will take three to four hours, Yamada said.Separately, due to a glitch in the engine assembly process, Toyota is recalling the Lexus GS350, made between July 2005 and July 2011, Lexus IS350 manufactured between August 2005 and June 2011, and Lexus IS350C produced between June 2010 and July 2011.In this case, Toyota is recalling around 106,000 vehicles in North America and 59,000 in Japan. In Japan, Toyota is also recalling certain Crown and Mark X vehicles.In the engine, bolts used to secure a device called the variable-valve timing system, which controls camshafts, could become loose. That increases crash risks as it could lead to engine stoppage, Toyota said.Toyota will replace the variable-valve timing system, which will take more than six hours, Yamada said.She declined to comment on how much the recalls will cost.	-0.2387774594
DETROIT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s high-end Model S sedan lost its “recommended�� rating and the electric carmaker slid overall by six spots to almost the bottom in Consumer Reports magazine’s annual reliability survey.Every domestic automaker landed in the bottom half of the magazine’s new-car reliability rankings, which include data collected for more than 500,000 vehicles. The survey, which ranked 29 brands in the U.S. market, was released on Wednesday.“It’s the complexities that have really dragged down Tesla,�� said Jake Fisher, the magazine’s director of auto testing. “The majority of the problems that we’re seeing with Tesla truly are mechanical issues.”The Model S appears similar to the model launched six years ago, but Tesla has made significant mechanical and software changes over the past few years, including making air suspension and all-wheel-drive standard, he said. That can hurt reliability as more complexity is added.Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus and Toyota brands took the top two spots, as they have for six consecutive years. The survey results can be found at CR.org/reliability.The magazine’s annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.Tesla’s ranking slid to No. 27, ahead of only General Motors Co’s Cadillac brand and Volvo.The Model S, which starts at $74,500, dropped to “Below Average�� from “Above Average�� last year, and its overall score denied it Consumer Reports�� “Recommended�� tag. Owners reported suspension problems and other issues, including the extending door handle, the magazine said.Tesla’s Model X SUV remained “Much Worse Than Average�� with ongoing problems, including the falcon-wing doors and center display screen. The Model 3 sedan, seen as key to Tesla’s profitability, debuted with “Average�� reliability.In May, Consumer Reports recommended the Model 3 after its latest tests showed a software update improved the car’s braking.Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday.Other domestic brand rankings included: Ford Motor Co’s Ford and Lincoln brands at No. 18 and 20; GM’s Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands at No. 19, 23 and 25; and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles�� Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler and Ram brands at No. 21, 22, 24 and 26, respectively.Rounding out the survey’s top five were Japan’s Mazda Motor Corp, which registered the biggest gain, by nine spots; Subaru and Hyundai Motor Co’s Kia brand.

TOKYO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday that it had completed an investigation of parts that were supplied by Kobe Steel Ltd with falsified data, and found that they had caused no problems to its vehicles�� quality or performance.Kobe Steel admitted in October that it had falsified data on product quality and specifications, rocking supply chains around the world in a fresh blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturer.Toyota in November provided a partial result of its review of Kobe materials and had said it would provide a full update at a later date.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - European car sales rose 4.6 percent in October, according to industry data published on Tuesday, as a broad-based recovery took root in the region’s main auto markets.Toyota 7203.T and Renault RENA.PA led the advance among mass manufacturers, with Daimler DAIGn.DE gaining ground on premium rivals as total registrations rose to 1.04 million cars, the Association of European Automakers said.Despite what may become a sustained upturn in demand, the European auto market is set to post a sixth consecutive full-year decline in 2013 to its lowest level in two decades. Registrations were down 3.1 percent for January-October across the European Union and EFTA trading bloc.But the year-on-year advance in October - a month after sales turned positive with a 5.5 percent increase - may embolden car executives planning for a return to full-year growth in 2014, albeit a low single-digit rate.“The market could pick up more quickly than we had anticipated,�� said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for LMC Automotive.Ford F.N, PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA and General Motors GM.N have all reacted to the slump by closing plants.But with factories still running at an average 65 percent of maximum output, Poskitt cautioned, “overcapacity remains an issue��.Carmakers that have kept up investment to launch successful new models in recent months are already gaining market share in the beginnings of a recovery.Renault’s group sales jumped 14 percent on strong demand for its Captur mini-SUV and revamps of the no-frills Dacia brand’s Logan and Sandero models.Toyota surged 16.5 percent to 49,097 cars last month, helped by models like the Auris compact.European market leader Volkswagen and General Motors GM.N also outpaced the broader expansion with respective gains of 5.7 percent and 6.2 percent.Within the VW group total, sales at the premium Audi division shrank 0.5 percent, while rival BMW BMWG.DE rose just 0.3 percent. Both trailed an 8.5 percent gain for Daimler's Mercedes-Benz division on the popularity of new models like the CLA compact.October’s registrations increase was helped by positive contributions in all major European markets - including a 34 percent surge in Spain - with the exception of Italy.“Spain’s increase is very positive,�� said Peter Fuss, a senior automotive specialist with Ernst &amp; Young. “It’s a sign that confidence in the euro zone is coming back.”The Italian market's further 5.6 percent decline compounded the punishment for Fiat FIA.MI, which has slashed investment to ride out the crisis and pursue a buyout of 58.5 percent-owned Chrysler.The group’s ageing model lineup suffered a 7.3 percent drop in European sales, led by declines of 12.2 percent at Lancia and 34 percent at the Alfa Romeo brand, still awaiting a long-promised revival plan.While IHS Automotive forecasters expect a return to low Italian growth next year, Fiat-Chrysler’s regional boss Alfredo Altavilla said this month he saw no recovery signs yet.Despite a 2.6 percent French market expansion and new model launches, Peugeot posted a further 0.7 percent regional sales decline - a worrying sign for the Paris-based carmaker as it struggles to halt losses threatening its independent survival.That eroded the Peugeot and Citroen brands�� combined European market share to 11 percent for the first 10 months of 2013 from 11.8 percent a year earlier.	-5.791352638
PARIS (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has begun exporting French-made Yaris compact cars to customers in North America for the first time this month.Toyota said it planned to export around 25,000 gasoline versions of the Yaris built at the northern French town of Onnaing, near Valenciennes, to the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico annually.“There are many reasons to preserve production of compact cars in France but all partners need to work together to maintain Toyota Motor Manufacturing France’s competitive advantage,�� Toyota Motor Europe Chief Executive Didier Leroy said in a statement on Thursday.The Yaris accounted for nearly 22 percent of Toyota’s total European sales in 2012, with 182,841 vehicles, the Japanese carmaker said.Production in France for export to North America began on May 6, it said.Toyota's plan, unveiled last June, followed decisions by Japanese rivals Honda Motor Co 7267.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T to open factories in Mexico to serve North America and reduce loss-making exports from Japan.French carmakers Renault RENA.PA and PSA Peugeot Citroen PEUP.PA are trying to cut costs as they struggle with overcapacity and weak demand for cars in Europe.Renault aims to cut 7,500 posts in France by 2016 and has negotiated a nationwide deal on pay and conditions to boost competitiveness, while PSA is scrapping more than 10,000 domestic jobs and closing an assembly plant near Paris.	-5.450832548
SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS are being investigated by U.S. prosecutors over whether vehicle recalls were conducted properly, a person said and documents reviewed by Reuters showed.Shares of the South Korean firms fell on Thursday on worries the probe could lead to fines and more recalls, while industry data showing a sharp drop in China’s passenger car retail sales in the first half of November spooked investors further.Hyundai and Kia, together the world’s No.5 automaker, recalled nearly 1.7 million vehicles in 2015 and 2017 in the United States in one of their biggest recalls in the country, citing an engine failure that increases the risk of a crash.The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), part of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), has launched a criminal investigation, the person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.It remains to be seen whether the probe will lead to charges, the person added. If criminal charges are filed, it could lead to hefty fines for the automakers.The DoJ is coordinating with the U.S. transport regulator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), on the investigation, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter is confidential.Nicole Navas Oxman, a DoJ spokeswoman, declined to comment.“The Justice Department generally does not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on the existence or non-existence of an investigation,�� she said in an emailed statement to Reuters.The United States has previously investigated and imposed strict penalties on other automakers such as Toyota Motor 7203.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE. In 2017, a U.S. judge dismissed a criminal charge against Toyota here after it completed three years of monitoring under a $1.2 billion settlement in which it admitted to misleading the public about sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles.The settlement comprised the largest penalty levied by the United States on an auto company until Volkswagen admitted to diesel emissions fraud and paid $4.3 billion in fines in 2017.“Investors are concerned that the investigations may not only lead to more recall costs and fines, but also hurt their brand image and sales,�� Nomura analyst Angela Hong said.Hyundai and Kia are already grappling with weak business in their key markets - China and the United States.Data from the China Passenger Car Association shows overall passenger car retail sales in the world’s top auto marker fell 32 percent in the first 16 days of November.Hyundai shares tumbled 5 percent to their lowest in more than nine years, while Kia shed 5 percent, in a broader market .KS11 that was down 0.3 percent. Auto parts supplier Hyundai Mobis 012330.KS cratered about 9 percent, while Hanon Systems 018880.KS gave up 5 percent.Hyundai declined to comment on China sales and the U.S. investigation.“ACTIVE�� INVESTIGATIONApart from the SDNY probe, Hyundai and Kia are also the subject of an investigation by NHTSA into whether their recalls covered enough vehicles and were conducted in a timely manner.NHTSA has “active�� investigations into engine issues related to certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles, the regulator told Reuters.“These investigations are ongoing - no final conclusions have been reached,�� it added.Hyundai and Kia have already set aside roughly 1 trillion won ($885 million) in 2017 and 2018 to cover costs mainly stemming from recalls over engine problems.In the United States, Hyundai recalled 470,000 Sonata sedans in 2015 due to the failure of “Theta II�� engines. In 2017, it expanded its U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe sport utility vehicles, citing the same engine issue, the NHTSA said.Kia also recalled 618,160 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles which use the same engine in the United States.However, Kim Gwang-ho, a then engineer at Hyundai and a company veteran of 26 years, told NHTSA the companies should have recalled more vehicles in 2015, citing an internal report.($1 = 1,129.4500 won)	-6.599281597
"(Reuters) - The 2013 Dodge Dart is ""underpowered,"" according to testers for Consumer Reports magazine, which also said it was ""underwhelmed"" by the performance of two American luxury cars, General Motors Co's GM.N 2013 Cadillac XTS and Ford Motor Co's F.N 2013 Lincoln MKS.The magazine, which annually tests and rates hundreds of new and used cars and trucks, said it recommended a fourth model, Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T redesigned Lexus ES sedan, although testers said the 2013 model ""took a step back in ride and interior refinement from the previous ES.""The 2013 Dart sedan, which competes with such cars as the Toyota Corolla and the Ford Focus, is the first jointly developed model from Fiat SpA FIA.MI and its U.S. affiliate Chrysler.Consumer Reports lauded the Dart’s “solid feel, handling and ride,�� but said the compact sedan “can’t yet measure up to the best in class.”The magazine ranked the Cadillac higher than the Lincoln, but said neither car scored well enough to earn its recommendation.It singled out Cadillac’s new CUE infotainment system as “convoluted and frustrating,�� while faulting the Lincoln’s “cramped driving position, ungainly handling, uncomposed ride, and limited visibility.”The reviews will be in the magazine’s January issue."	7.509179202
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T said they plan to explore a possible partnership, citing technological challenges and the need to keep up with consolidation in the global auto industry.Toyota invests heavily in R&amp;D for automated driving functions and artificial intelligence for mobility purposes while cost-conscious Suzuki, which specializes in affordable compact cars, has yet to announce major strategic plans on how to compete in new automotive technologies.Both companies said that they had just begun discussing possible cooperation so nothing was decided about areas in which they might collaborate.However Suzuki chairman Osamu Suzuki said his firm was struggling to keep pace with the breakneck speed of R&amp;D, telling a news conference “R&amp;D in the auto industry is changing rapidly. The future looks perilous.”A partnership between Toyota and Suzuki would be the latest in an increasingly consolidating auto industry. Nissan Motor Co. 7201.T in May announced it was planning to take a controlling stake in embattled Mitsubishi Motors Corp 7211.T. A partnership Suzuki had with Germany's Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE ended on a sour note last year, after the German carmaker accused it of violating their pact by agreeing a diesel engine deal with Italy's Fiat.Toyota completed a buyout of Daihatsu Motors earlier this year. The world’s largest automaker by vehicle sales in 2015 said last week it will set up a company with Daihatsu to focus on emerging markets.Suzuki, Japan's fourth-largest automaker, competes fiercely with Daihatsu in the domestic market and dominates the Indian market through its majority stake in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd MRTI.NS. Both firms concentrate on smaller vehicles.Toyota and Suzuki said there was need for increased industry cooperation to keep pace with rapid changes in the global auto industry, where automakers and technology companies are competing to develop self-driving cars and new mobility services.“The technology race in the auto industry has been escalating at a pace we’ve never seen before,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters.“In a situation like this, there are limits to what any one company can do on their own ... partnerships are becoming increasingly important.”The companies said they would continue to compete and would be open to collaborating with other companies.CLSA analyst Christopher Richter said that Suzuki could benefit from gaining access to Toyota technology.But citing Suzuki’s past experience with Volkswagen, he added that he saw the possibility that the firm, headed by the outspoken 86-year-old Suzuki, one of the longest-serving executives in the global auto industry, may be unlikely to heel to a much bigger partner.“VW was very much a manager which liked to be in control, and so is Toyota. Meanwhile, Suzuki wants to march to its own step.”�Suzuki is very protective of its independence.”He added that a difference in corporate culture at Toyota, which has long had resources to spend on new technologies, and Suzuki, whose success has been driven by its knack for cost cutting, may pose challenges to a partnership.	-2.778983934
JAKARTA, April 25 (Reuters) - Indonesian vehicle sale are likely to ease slightly this year to 1-1.05 million because of an expected cut in fuel subsidies and higher downpayment requirements for sharia loans, a top Indonesian industry official said on Thursday.“Most likely, sales will be smaller than last year. Around 1 to 1.05 million, or less than 1 million if something dramatic happens,�� said Johnny Darmawan, CEO of Toyota Astra Motor and also vice chairman of Gaikindo (Indonesian Automotive Industry Association).Indonesia’s total vehicle sales were a record 1.1 million last year.Separately, the head of banking-to-autos holding company PT Astra International Tbk, Prijono Sugiarto, said the company has raised its capital expenditure budget 20 percent to 15.5 trillion rupiah ($1.60 billion) or 20 percent higher from the same period last year.

PRAGUE, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Czech car production rose 10.5 percent to a record 1.25 million vehicles in 2014 as markets in Europe and further afield recovered, an industry association said on Tuesday, adding output would remain high this year.The growth has helped underpin the central European country’s export-reliant economy, which is on firmer ground after a record-long recession ended in 2013.“I expect this year’s figures for overall vehicle production could be a bit higher but the growth dynamic will likely not be the same as in 2014,�� Czech Automotive Industry Association president Martin Jahn said.Volkswagen unit Skoda Auto is the biggest Czech car producer and largest exporter. Hyundai Motor is ranked second and TPCA - a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corp and PSA Peugeot Citroen - third.While the bulk of Czech car output is exported, domestic sales are also on the up, reaching a record 192,314 in 2014. They should rise further this year, the country’s Car Importers�� Association said earlier this month.	5.301223971
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Ride-hailing firm Grab has launched a pilot program for motorbike hailing in Malaysia, barely a month after regional rival Gojek was given the green light to begin limited operations in the country.The Singapore-based company, a dominant player in Southeast Asia after it acquired Uber’s [UBER.UL] business in the region last year, said on its website that the move was in line with the government’s effort to test out the service.Grab is backed by familiar names in technology sector including SoftBank Group Corp, Microsoft Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and Uber.Malaysia said earlier this month that it will allow motorbike-hailing services such as Indonesia’s Gojek to operate on a limited scale for six months from January next year as pilot schemes to measure demand for the service.The six-month program would allow the government and participating firms to gather data and evaluate demand while officials work on drafting legislation to govern bike-hailing.Grab said the pilot service - limited to Klang Valley, Malaysia’s most developed region, where the capital Kuala Lumpur is located - will also include food delivery. The company is recruiting pilot drivers until next Monday.Grab already operates GrabBike in other markets like Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.	-0.2682479175

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission on Wednesday said it launched an investigation into whether Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and its subsidiaries infringed hybrid electric vehicle patents owned by Baltimore-based Paice LLC.The commission said it has not made any decisions on the merits of the case. But a ruling against Volkswagen could be a significant setback to the automaker’s strategy to shift towards hybrid vehicles after a crushing emissions fraud scandal halted sales of its diesel vehicles in the United States last year.Paice is seeking an ITC order that would block the import and sale of Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche brand hybrid vehicles in the U.S. market. It filed its initial request on April 15.After a similar ITC complaint and federal lawsuits against Toyota Motor Corp, 7203.T Paice struck a licensing deal in 2010 with Toyota that covers 23 hybrid electrical control patents. In 2015, it said it reached similar licensing agreements with Hyundai Motor Co Ltd 005380.KS and Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS.Paice claims on its website that it shared with Volkswagen its patented hybrid technology, including computer modeling and control algorithms with Volkswagen from 2001 to 2004 in a“But after learning everything it needed from Paice, VW abruptly ended the collaboration and never licensed Paice’s technology,�� the company said, adding that the automaker shifted its efforts to develop diesel technology instead.Paice, founded in the early 1990s by Soviet-trained electrical engineer Alex Severinsky, said it holds 29 U.S. and foreign patents related to hybrid vehicle technology. The firm is partly owned by the non-profit Abell Foundation in Baltimore, which has provided over $25 million in funding support and is also listed as a complainant in the ITC case.The Baltimore firm also has pursued patent litigation against Ford Motor Co. F.N since 2014. In that case, however, Ford has managed to get some of Paice's infringement claims dismissed by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, while several other challenges are pending. In Germany, a VW spokesman said the company “does not comment in principal in ongoing legal disputes��.In comments submitted on the ITC website, lawyers for Volkswagen and its subsidiaries described Paice’s patents as “weak�� and said pursuing an investigation was against the public interest.A submission from Edgar Haug, a lawyer for Porsche AG, said that Paice’s complaint relies too heavily on investments made by Hyundai and Kia as part of their technology licenses with the firm.“Neither Hyundai nor Kia sell competitive articles that replace or are a substitute for Porsche’s accused vehicles,�� Haug wrote.	6.214235519
HANOI, April 8 (Reuters) - Hoang Hai turned his back on a Vietnamese business that was headed for bankruptcy and became a driving instructor instead. Now he is riding a wave of interest in car ownership as the country’s trend-setting middle class swaps two wheels for four.The Hanoi driving school where Hai works is inundated with people eager to get behind the wheel. About 300 have applied each month so far this year, double the rate in 2014.Hai, 45, says at least eight out of 10 learners don’t own a car, but they all want one. “As soon as there is an intention to buy a car, they’ll take a driving lesson,�� he said.Famous for its swarms of scooters, Vietnam is seeing auto sales surge amid the rapid expansion of a young, style-conscious middle class after 15 straight years of economic growth of over 5 percent.While major regional car markets Indonesia and Thailand saw annual declines in auto sales last year, Vietnam’s leapt 43 percent, Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers Association (VAMA) data shows. Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Honda reported solid annual sales increases, despite high import taxes.The number of households in Vietnam with financial assets of $100,000 to $2 million will soon be among the fastest-growing in the world, according to Economist Intelligence Unit research, fuelling luxury vehicles sales in a country where gross domestic product per capita is still only about $1,500.Porsche Cayennes and Bentleys can nowadays be seen jostling with budget cars and scooters on the chaotic boulevards of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.BMW says its sales in Vietnam since 2007 have jumped an average 20 percent to 30 percent annually, with more units sold in the past two years than the more populated Philippines, though still far behind more developed Thailand and Malaysia.“Vietnamese are very entrepreneurial,�� Horst Herdtle, head of importer BMW Euro Auto Vietnam, said. “They want their cars to reflect that success.”Importers say that while high taxes are putting the brakes on Vietnam’s auto market, some of these obstacles should disappear in 2018 when import duties on cars traded among Southeast Asian countries are removed.Andreas Klingler, general director of Porsche’s Vietnam importer, said there was a waiting list of almost 100 people for the German sports cars, and most customers wanted their rides customised.“Most of our clients prefer to configure their own dream car,�� Klingler said in an email.While importers eagerly await the lowering of regional tariff barriers, the domestic auto manufacturing industry is bracing for tough times.Toyota Vietnam president Yoshihisa Maruta told reporters last week the company was considering whether to continue its assembling operation in Vietnam, as importing complete cars from other Southeast Asian countries would be cheaper in 2018.Motorcycle salesmen are also nervous about the future.Registered motorcycles in Vietnam, where one in two citizens owns a bike, fell annually from about 3.3-3.7 million units during 2011-2013 to 2.92 million last year, according to official data in state media. Resident motorcycle makers include Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda and Piaggio.For many who can afford it, upgrading is a must, not just from motorcycles, but to as flashy a ride as possible.“Once you drive cars, you no longer want to ride bikes,�� said Doan Van Tuan, an employee of a government firm, as he inspected the new BMW X6 model at its Hanoi launch.“You hang out with your friends whose cars are nicer than yours - you have to look at the trend and think again.�� (Editing by Martin Petty and Stephen Coates)	1.55781049
TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo 2020 organizers have started drafting possible alternatives to holding the Olympics this summer, two sources familiar with the talks said, in contrast to the Japanese government’s stance that postponement is not an option.While the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted sports events around the world, Japan has been steadfast in saying that the Games will go on. The top government spokesman on Wednesday said Tokyo wasn’t preparing for postponement.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has staked his legacy as Japan’s longest-serving premier on the Games and is hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending. At risk is more than $3 billion in domestic sponsorship, an Olympic record, and some $12 billion spent on preparations.“Finally, we have been asked to make a simulation in case of a postponement,�� said one of the sources, an official close to the organizing committee who is involved in drafting the scenarios.Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.“We are making alternative plans - plan B, C, D - looking at different postponement time-frames,�� said the official, adding the scenarios included cost estimates for different delays.Neither Tokyo 2020 organizers nor the International Olympic Committee (IOC) immediately responded to a request for comment. The government of Japan could not be reached for comment.The options, which include scaling back the Games or holding them without spectators, would be debated by the organizing committee at the end of March, the official said.The second source, who is also close to the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, confirmed that postponement was being discussed, including delays of one or two years.Some organizing staff were holding out hope for a delay of a month or 45 days, said the official involved in drafting the scenarios.A final decision on postponement will have to come from the IOC but Japan’s stance also matters.The IOC and its powerful chief, Thomas Bach, say the Games will go ahead as planned, drawing fire from athletes who say that could be a health risk.Two other insiders, both senior members of the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, echoed those concerns. One of them, a board member of the organizing committee, said the decision to postpone should be made quickly.“The more they push the decision away ... more and more preparations have to be made - this will cause cancellation fees to go through the roof,�� the board member said.Bach recently appeared to shift his tone, saying the IOC was “considering different scenarios��.Japan’s Nikkei newspaper said in a report on its website on Sunday that the IOC will hold a board meeting this week, as calls from sporting organizations for the event to be postponed gathered pace.The official involved in drafting scenarios said a long delay could spark complaints from older athletes and require keeping sponsors on board for longer. Another headache is the Olympic village, due to be converted to flats after the Games.The summer 2021 calendar is already crowded while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.Japanese sponsors are nervous, company representatives have said privately. Major sponsors include Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Panasonic Corp 6752.T.“Of course companies are individually discussing what to do,�� said a representative of one of the more than 60 sponsors. “No one wants to be the first to say anything about the possibility of a postponement.”Japan Airlines Co 9201.T discussed that there was an 80% chance the Olympics would not be held as scheduled on a recent internal conference call, a person briefed on the call said. A JAL spokesman said: “Our preparations are underway for the Games to open as scheduled��.In Tokyo, there is a sense delay may be inevitable. Finance Minister Taro Aso has compared Tokyo 2020 to the 1940 Olympics canceled by World War II, and the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games.“It’s a problem that’s happened every 40 years,�� he said. “It’s the cursed Olympics - and that’s a fact.��	8.613861386
DETROIT (Reuters) - Automakers on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected U.S. new car sales of 1.6 million in May, with rising consumer demand underpinning a broader recovery in the U.S. economy.The auto industry in May recorded its strongest annual sales rate since before the 2008 recession, as transaction prices remained strong and discounts did not increase.Industry sales rose 11.3 percent to 1,606,264 vehicles, according to a compilation of manufacturers�� results by Reuters.The top seven automakers beat analysts' expectations, some by a wide margin. General Motors Co GM.N and Chrysler Group FIA.MI said May sales were the best for that month in seven years. Nissan Motor Co 7201.T set a sales record for May and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS had its best month ever. Ford Motor Co F.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T also topped forecasts.The annual sales rate in May hit 16.77 million vehicles, the strongest pace since it reached the same level in February 2007, according to research firm Autodata. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rate of 16.1 million.“Industry sales in May soared as consumer confidence improved and demand for new vehicles continued to strengthen,�� said Bill Fay, group vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA.A record number of recalls at GM since the first of the year did not crimp demand for the automaker’s new vehicles.GM’s May sales were up 12.6 percent to 284,694 vehicles, well above the consensus of nine analysts polled by Reuters. All four GM brands reported sales increases, with gains at Chevrolet and GMC driven in part by strong demand for new full-size utility vehicles and pickups.Ford said May sales rose 3.0 percent to 254,084 vehicles. Chrysler was up 16.7 percent to 194,421. Toyota climbed 17.0 percent, to 243,236; Honda, up 9.0 percent to 152,603; Nissan up 18.8 percent to 135,934, and Hyundai-Kia up 8.5 percent to 130,994.The U.S. auto industry experienced a third straight month of strong sales after cold and snowy weather pressured results in January and February. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May industry sales to rise about 7 percent.Monthly auto sales are an early snapshot of consumer demand for big-ticket items. U.S. new-car sales in April rose 8 percent and the annual selling rate finished at 16.04 million vehicles.Specific indicators in May were mixed. Sales of full-size pickup trucks rose 17.2 percent at Chrysler and 9.5 percent at GM. At Ford, sales of the best-selling F-series pickup fell 4.3 percent, with the automaker trimming discounts on 2014 models as it readies the launch this summer of a redesigned, aluminum-intensive 2015 F-series.Average transaction price for a new vehicle in May was $32,307, according to research firm Kelley Blue Book, which said average new-car prices were up $653 from a year ago, but down slightly from April.	5.835080363
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will bring to India models with global specifications, its local unit head told Reuters, as it seeks to boost sales in the world’s fifth largest passenger car market by appealing to buyers�� increasingly aspirational tastes.For the past 20 years, Japan’s biggest automaker has made cars specifically for India, but it has failed to catch up with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co, which together account for around two-thirds of sales in a market skewed towards cars costing less than $8,000.Toyota has now set its sights on the higher-end of the market, joining other automakers such Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles-owned Jeep and Renault SA targeting an expanding, affluent middle class willing to spend on premium cars such as sports-utility vehicles.“The Indian customer has changed from Indian local standard to global standard, and in the next 10 years it will exceed global standards,�� Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said in an interview ahead of the Auto Expo car show held in India every two years.“We need to catch up with changing customers and changing government regulations,�� Tachibana said. “We are now a little successful in India but it is not enough.”Toyota’s current market share hovers around 5 percent and its two India plants operate at about half their capacity to manufacture more than 300,000 vehicles a year.Sales of the last two no-frills models made specifically for India - the Etios sedan and the Liva hatchback - were lackluster as customers criticized the company for compromising on quality and finish to keep costs low.Pricier models such as the Innova multi-purpose vehicle and Fortuner sport-utility vehicle - which cost more than 1 million rupees ($15,593) - have done much better, though, and analysts say Toyota’s strategy to focus on this segment is sound.“India is not the country it used to be. Earlier to develop a specific product for India was the need of the hour,�� said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst at research firm, IHS Markit.“Now Indian customers want global products,�� he said, adding that a government push to adopt stricter emission norms is also driving the switch to global models.Passenger vehicle sales in India grew about 9 percent in 2017 to 3.2 million units, industry data showed. India is expected to become the world’s third-largest car market by 2020.On Wednesday, Toyota unveiled the Yaris sedan ahead of the car show. The car, which will compete with Honda’s City sedan and Hyundai’s Verna sedan, is expected to go on sale after April.($1 = 64.1300 Indian rupees)	-3.042475638

Tokyo, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Aircraft said on Friday it will delay the maiden test flight of Japan’s first commercial jet in half a century by at least two weeks to fix a faulty pedal in the test plane’s cockpit.Already three years late, Mitsubishi Aircraft, which earlier this year pushed back the first test flight from June, is under pressure to get the aircraft ready for deliveries slated to start in June 2017 to Japan’s biggest carrier ANA Holdings .The rescheduled test flight will occur sometime during the second week of November, Mitsubishi Aircraft said in a press release.The Mitsubishi Heavy Industries subsidiary, in which Toyota Motor Corp is an investor, is building the $47-million regional jet with just under 100 seats in a bid to supplant Canada’s Bombardier Inc as the world’s second biggest maker of smaller passenger jetliners, behind Brazil’s Embraer SA.So far the jet, called the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), has secured 223 firm orders from airline operators including ANA, and the most recent for 32 planes in January from Japan Airlines. The biggest order, for 100 aircraft, with a further 100 options is from Trans State Holdings, a closely-held company that operates three regional U.S. airlines.

* Low gas prompts shift to larger, fuel-guzzling cars* U.S. demand for pickups soars, Japanese firms seek bigger share* Toyota, Honda, Nissan all targeting U.S. marketDETROIT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japanese automakers are taking on Detroit’s Big Three and scrambling to expand their share of pickup truck sales in the United States, as record low gasoline prices curb demand for their once best-selling small and medium-sized sedans.Soaring demand for SUVs and pickup trucks drove U.S. auto sales to a record high last year, as the lowest fuel prices in seven years prompted a shift from sedans and smaller cars to larger vehicles in the world’s biggest auto market.The big U.S. automakers - Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Chrysler - have so far gained the most from this shift, with many selling pickups at luxury car prices.Faced with slowing demand growth for smaller models including the Civic, the Camry and the Altima, Japanese automakers such as Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co Ltd now want in, launching beefed up models at the Detroit auto show this week.“We’re looking for 5 percent share of the full-sized pickup truck segment,�� Nissan North America Chairman Jose Munoz said at the Detroit auto show this week, citing a figure that dwarfs Nissan’s roughly 0.6 percent market share of the full-sized pickup segment last year.The automaker launched a hulking concept design for its Titan XD pickup model at the event.While Japanese automakers have steadily grown their share of the SUV and crossover markets, their share of the higher-margin truck market was 14.7 percent in 2015, according to automotive researcher Kelley Blue Book, down from 20.5 percent in 2007.Regaining market share will be tough, however, as many truck buyers tend to remain loyal to U.S. models, senior analyst Karl Brauer said, but the Japanese automakers still have a chance.“If volumes continue to rise they could take some new share as new buyers to the segment might be open to models by overseas makers,�� Brauer said, adding that recently launched new models could help the Japanese brands.In a bid to attract truck buyers, Toyota last year launched a redesigned version of its Tacoma compact pickup.Honda also said this week that it would soon launch the first revamp of its Ridgeline mid-sized pick up in a decade and which would target the “tail-gating�� crowd which hold parties in parking lots.The vehicle offers features such as audio speakers in the load bed and beer-cooler-sized well under the bed floor, features many rival trucks don’t have.

CANBERRA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is cutting 350 jobs at its Australian manufacturing operations due to an ongoing downturn in production levels, a rare move from the Japanese auto giant.“Toyota Australia is facing severe operating conditions resulting in unsustainable financial returns due to factors including the strong Australian currency, reduced cost competitiveness and volume decline, especially in export markets,�� Toyota Australia president Max Yasuda said in a statement on Monday.Toyota’s Australian production levels had dropped 36 percent in four years, from 149,000 in 2007 to an expected 95,000 in 2012, he added.Toyota Australia employs 4,683 people in Australia.	18.49613493
PRAGUE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Czech car production rose 4.2 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of the year, supported in part by solid domestic sales, the Automotive Industry Association said on Wednesday.Local factories of Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto, Hyundai Motor and the Toyota-Peugeot joint venture TPCA made 1,053,489 cars combined in the January-September period, it said.In the whole of 2016, the production reached 1,344,182.

(Adds final annual sales rate, paragraph 5)DETROIT, June 3 (Reuters) - Automakers on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected U.S. new car sales of 1.6 million in May, with rising consumer demand underpinning a broader recovery in the U.S. economy.The auto industry in May recorded its strongest annual sales rate since before the 2008 recession, as transaction prices remained strong and discounts did not increase.Industry sales rose 11.3 percent to 1,606,264 vehicles, according to a compilation of manufacturers�� results by Reuters.The top seven automakers beat analysts�� expectations, some by a wide margin. General Motors Co and Chrysler Group said May sales were the best for that month in seven years. Nissan Motor Co set a sales record for May and Hyundai Motor Co had its best month ever. Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp also topped forecasts.The annual sales rate in May hit 16.77 million vehicles, the strongest pace since it reached the same level in February 2007, according to research firm Autodata. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rate of 16.1 million.“Industry sales in May soared as consumer confidence improved and demand for new vehicles continued to strengthen,�� said Bill Fay, group vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA.A record number of recalls at GM since the first of the year did not crimp demand for the automaker’s new vehicles.GM’s May sales were up 12.6 percent to 284,694 vehicles, well above the consensus of nine analysts polled by Reuters. All four GM brands reported sales increases, with gains at Chevrolet and GMC driven in part by strong demand for new full-size utility vehicles and pickups.Ford said May sales rose 3.0 percent to 254,084 vehicles. Chrysler was up 16.7 percent to 194,421. Toyota climbed 17.0 percent, to 243,236; Honda, up 9.0 percent to 152,603; Nissan up 18.8 percent to 135,934, and Hyundai-Kia up 8.5 percent to 130,994.The U.S. auto industry experienced a third straight month of strong sales after cold and snowy weather pressured results in January and February. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May industry sales to rise about 7 percent.Monthly auto sales are an early snapshot of consumer demand for big-ticket items. U.S. new-car sales in April rose 8 percent and the annual selling rate finished at 16.04 million vehicles.Specific indicators in May were mixed. Sales of full-size pickup trucks rose 17.2 percent at Chrysler and 9.5 percent at GM. At Ford, sales of the best-selling F-series pickup fell 4.3 percent, with the automaker trimming discounts on 2014 models as it readies the launch this summer of a redesigned, aluminum-intensive 2015 F-series.Average transaction price for a new vehicle in May was $32,307, according to research firm Kelley Blue Book, which said average new-car prices were up $653 from a year ago, but down slightly from April.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran police and soldiers raided the homes of a ruling-party mayor suspected of links to drug traffickers, uncovering a collection of luxury vehicles and more than 250 exotic birds, a prosecutor’s office spokesman said on Monday.Authorities on Sunday arrested Arnaldo Urbina Soto, the National Party mayor of Yoro, a city 68 miles (110 km) north of the capital Tegucigalpa, said a police source involved in the investigation. The arrest followed the raid on 10 properties in the Yoro area linked to Urbina Soto, the source said.Anti-drug police and soldiers found 11 vehicles, including Toyota Prado land cruisers and Toyota Hilux pickup trucks and four all-terrain vehicles or quad bikes, the source said. Authorities also found about 250 fighting cocks, two ostriches, several peacocks, guns and a set of gold-encrusted cutlery.The raid was part of a continuing operation against the “criminal gang of Urbina Soto,�� which is being investigated for crimes including drug offenses, murder and rape, a national anti-narcotics unit known as DLCN said in a statement.The investigation, dubbed “Operation Justice,�� has so far resulted in the arrests of nine people, including one person with a Mexican passport, the statement said, without giving any other names.Diana Urbina Soto, a National Party lawmaker from Yoro and the mayor’s sister, denied that the haul was ill-gotten.“There is no illegal activity in our family, and we will prove it,�� she told local television on Monday, adding that the objects had been in the family for more than 100 years.The mayor was to face a hearing on Monday on charges of illegal possession of weapons and illicit enrichment, the public ministry said.Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate, according to the United Nations, with 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people in 2012.Gang warfare has blighted the Central American country for years, with security deteriorating further after violent Mexican drug cartels expanded into Honduras, using it as a pit stop for moving Andean cocaine north to the United States.National Party President Juan Hernandez has stepped up the use of army resources in an effort to tame the drug gangs and lower the murder rate.Yoro is the capital of Yoro department, equivalent to a state or province.The area is known for drug trafficking; many planes from South America land there.	-5.100348316
NAGOYA, Japan, July 1 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp executives have sometimes seemed to share the personality of the automaker’s best-selling cars - dependable and efficient, but also a bit boring and bland.That’s changing. In recent months, Toyota founding family scion and President Akio Toyoda has emerged from the bureaucratic shadows to present himself as the company’s car-loving, fashion-forward salesman-in-chief.The marketing campaign aides have built around Toyoda is an unconventional move for a Japanese corporate icon where team play is prized above outsized personalities.In recent weeks, Toyoda has donned a race suit to drive the Lexus LFA super car at the 24-hour race in Germany’s Nuerburgring circuit and turned up at a Lexus party in New York with a hipster bow-tie and retro glasses.Meanwhile his assistants have kept a steady newsfeed on the “Toyota President’s Office�� Facebook page, which Toyoda was inspired to set up by the popularity of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s page.“I am at the top of Toyota and drive cars myself,�� Toyoda told reporters at an event in May when discussing the role he can play in to promote and develop the Lexus brand, which he has been directly overseeing since April. “I was also born with this name.”Toyota, which marked its 75th anniversary last year, for decades let its product speak for itself by building value-priced cars with bulletproof quality.In an industry with more than its fair share of celebrity CEOs comfortable with the limelight, such as Chrysler’s Lee Iacocca and Nissan Motor Co and Renault SA’s Carlos Ghosn, at Toyota the real star has always been the “Toyota Way�� -- the production and management philosophy passed down from one generation to next from founder Kiichiro Toyoda.That still remains at the core. But as rivals from General Motors Co to Hyundai Motor Co to Volkswagen AG have narrowed the quality gap, the Japanese automaker has been forced to respond.In a J.D. Power &amp; Associates survey of initial quality released in June, a widely followed study in the industry, General Motors finished ahead of Toyota, highlighting the increased challenge for the one-time quality king.To push back, Toyota has been shaking up its slow decision-making process. It recently named non-Japanese to head regional operations in some areas and split the carmaker’s operations into four business teams, assigning executive vice presidents to head three of them.“The aim is for executives close to the site to see for themselves what is happening and make speedy decisions,�� Toyoda, 57, told a news conference on Monday.It is also trying to bring a new edginess to its brand image and design. That strategy has put the spotlight on Toyoda, according to people involved in the effort.It marks an unlikely, mid-career emergence for Toyoda, the grandson of the company’s founder, just a few years ago was blogging under a pseudonym.“One of the main things he is doing is giving Toyota, the company, a personality,�� said Julie Hamp, Toyota Motor North America’s Group Vice President in charge of communications.“He knows that Toyota needs a story and products to fire the emotions and to ground our identity in new realities today, which is a more competitive environment.”Toyota declined to make Toyoda available for an interview.What pushed Toyoda to embrace a radical corporate image makeover was a series of disasters including the recall crisis that hit the automaker in 2009, a senior Toyota executive said.Toyota recalled millions of vehicles globally because of problems including a glitch in the accelerator and floormat design.The company’s response to the crisis was slow and, most damagingly, Toyoda failed to speak up for the company. After weeks out of the spotlight, Toyoda, who had only been in the top job for eight months, called a news conference in Nagoya to apologise, but struggled to provide an English soundbite.When Toyoda was grilled by a U.S. congressional committee in February 2010, the experience was scarring, people knowledgeable about his thinking have said. It left him convinced the company had to change its approach.The organisational changes are a key part of the response, aimed at putting more decisions at the local level so that Toyota can react to problems faster, while the embrace of social media is a means of taking control of releasing information.Until then, Toyoda had seemed uncomfortable with reporters, only lighting up when talking about his great grandfather’s loom design or the principles of Toyota’s quality control, and he remained reluctant to put himself in the spotlight.To give him a nudge, the company’s designers prepared a kind of mock fashion magazine for their boss, featuring scenes with stylishly dressed male models all with Toyoda’s head superimposed on the image, the senior Toyota executive said.The idea was that Toyoda could be the star salesman if he could represent the brand and improve its image with edgy fashion at certain events.Toyoda first balked at the idea, but has since warmed to the role. In April, he took stage with a new look -- retro glasses, hip bowtie -- at the design-themed event for the luxury Lexus brand held in New York.Toyota still believes the ultimate differentiator will be its “ever-better cars��, as he likes to put it. But expressing a bit of personality could make Toyota more inviting.“The image of Toyota might have been that it is massive and hard to approach, especially those executives at the top who run the company - they are out of reach, above the clouds,�� the senior executive said. “That might have been the case in the past, but now that’s no longer true.��	1.422029405
TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday said it planned to stop output at more vehicles plants in Europe and Asia as the spread of the coronavirus prompts countries to instruct non-essential businesses to suspend operations.In a statement, the Japanese automaker said it had stopped operations at plants in Britain and Poland from Wednesday, while its Czech site would be halted on Thursday. Operations at its Turkey site would be suspended from Saturday.Its plant in the Philippines has stopped operations through mid-April, while its plant in Malaysia will be closed from next Monday through the end of March. U.S. plant operations have not been affected so far, it said. (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Alex Richardson)	2.943415377
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. - Jimmie Johnson ran three times on Sunday, but only two of the occasions involved his No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro.Before Daytona 500 time trials, Johnson ran the Daytona Beach Half-Marathon, which starts on the tri-oval at Daytona International Speedway and ends 13.1 miles later after a run to the sands of Daytona Beach.“Yeah, I ran the Daytona Half Marathon this morning which is always a great event,�� said Johnson, who takes his fitness training seriously. “And it’s certainly one to weigh on my mind as I’m eating all the Christmas candy and holiday things that we do, knowing that there’s a half-marathon out there for me and keeps me a little more honest and in shape. So it was a fun day today.”In the qualifying session that followed, Johnson posted the fourth-fastest lap behind pole winner Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Hendrick Motorsports teammates Alex Bowman and Chase Elliott.Next Sunday’s Daytona 500 will be Johnson’s last as a full-time NASCAR Cup Series driver. Understandably, the seven-time champion feels a tug between nostalgia and the job at hand.“It’s a balancing act,�� Johnson acknowledged. “I want to soak it in, but I’m just wired to race. I want to win races, and I want to be a championship threat. So I’ll try to figure that out as the year goes on. Things are pretty casual this first week here in Daytona.“As we get to the 500 and the races that follow, I’m sure I’ll gravitate more toward the work side and the performance side of life. But I’m just thankful to be here. It’s been a heck of a run, and I’m very excited to start my final full-time season.”WRECK IN BUSCH CLASH CAUSES FRICTION BETWEEN PENSKE TEAMMATESAfter a six-car wreck on Lap 66 eliminated him from Sunday’s Bush Clash at Daytona International Speedway, Brad Keselowski took aim at Joey Logano, his Team Penske teammate.Logano had taken the lead on Lap 59 and was attempting to block a run from Kyle Busch seven laps later. As Logano moved down the track, the nose of Busch’s car tapped the left side of Logano’s rear bumper, turning Logano.With his lane blocked at the top of the track, Keselowski drove into the wreck. Ultimately, Keselowski climbed from his mangled No. 2 Ford and slapped the side of a waiting ambulance in disgust before climbing in for his mandatory ride to the care center.After his release from the medical facility, Keselowski minced no words in placing blame for the incident. Was it Logano’s fault?“Yeah, it was just a dumb move,�� Keselowski said. “There is no reason to make that move. It was never going to work, and it didn’t. Here we are. We are wrecked out of the race, and now a Ford isn’t going to win. Most likely and a Toyota is. It was just dumb to take out the best car for a move that was never going to work.”Told that Keselowski was annoyed with his blocking tactics, Logano had a facile response.“Apparently we all suck at this, ‘cause there are only like three cars left right now, so I wouldn’t say anyone was really good,�� Logano said.Keselowski, at least, was correct in his prediction. Erik Jones won in a Toyota.Daniel Suarez is living proof that the best-laid plans can sometimes go awry.After losing his ride at Stewart-Haas Racing, Suarez signed on with Gaunt Brothers Racing for the 2020 season. The Mexican driver opted to forego the spot he had earned in Sunday’s Busch Clash at Daytona to concentrate on his Daytona 500 effort.The strategy didn’t work. Suarez was 36th among 43 drivers and failed to secure one of two spots available to non-chartered cars on speed. Those positions went to Justin Haley and Brendan Gaughan who were 31st and 33rd fastest, respectively.Accordingly, Suarez will have to race his way into the Great American race in the first of two Bluegreen Vacations Duels on Thursday night (7:30 p.m. ET on FS1, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). That means he’ll have to beat Haley, Reed Sorenson (34th qualifier) and Chad Finchum (41st) if he hopes to race next Sunday.“We have to race,�� Suarez said. “We have to race hard. We knew that we would have a lot of challenges and that we didn’t also have the raw speed, but I know what I can do. I just have to go out there Thursday and get it done.”Suarez and the Gaunt team had made the decision to skip the Clash before arriving at Daytona. But they were surprised in Saturday’s two practice sessions that the No. 96 Toyota wasn’t up to speed in single-car runs-though the car was able to keep up in the draft with the other Toyotas.“That was really the main goal, to focus on the Daytona 500 car,�� Suarez said of the decision not to race in the Clash. “Obviously, we just didn’t do enough of a good job, but we have to push hard, and we have to keep working and try to keep up. I know that... obviously, we all know that the car doesn’t have the raw speed that we were expecting. We all were pretty shocked (Saturday) to see that, but I know what I can do, and I know that I’m fast. I think we’ll be in good shape on Thursday. We just have to stay out of trouble.��--By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service. Special to Field Level Media.	-13.08748584
"LONDON (Reuters) - Nissan said it would take legal action against the official campaign for Britain to leave the European Union after the group used the Japanese carmaker’s logo in leaflets calling for voters to back Brexit on June 23.On one ""Vote Leave"" flyer, the firm's logo appeared next to those of four other major companies including Unilever ULVR.L and fellow carmaker Vauxhall GM.N with the message: ""Major employers ... have all said they'll stay in the UK whatever the result of the referendum."" Nissan, which says it would prefer Britain to remain in the EU, said it would be issuing legal proceedings on Monday in Britain’s High Court to stop ‘Vote Leave�� from using its name and logo and to “prevent them making any further false statements and misrepresentations concerning Nissan.“We vigorously protect the Nissan brand and intellectual property in all markets in which we operate,�� the firm said in a statement.Vote Leave did not comment immediately when contacted by Reuters.Nissan said earlier this month that it was considering legal action against the official campaign, a day after rival Toyota 7203.T said it could also make a legal complaint. On Monday, a spokesman at Toyota 7203.T said the firm's position had not changed.Consumer goods maker Unilever ULVR.L has also complained to the ""Vote Leave"" campaign over the use of its name and logo.On Monday, several carmakers repeated their calls for Britain to remain in the 28-member bloc, with tariff-less access to the single market benefiting major firms.In a letter to staff, Toyota’s UK managing director warned that leaving the bloc would impose duties on cars of up to 10 percent, forcing the firm to either make cuts or raise prices, negatively impacting sales.“If the UK leaves the EU, we think it unlikely that the UK can keep the current trading arrangements where there are ‘no tariffs or duties��,�� Shigeru Teramoto wrote in a letter jointly signed by a British trade union official."	1.624346527
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp plans to first deploy advanced self-driving features in commercial vehicles before adding them to cars meant for personal use, a senior official at the Japanese auto major said on Tuesday.It will be easier to apply self-driving technology that does not require constant and direct human-monitoring to taxis and vehicles Toyota is developing, including on-demand ride services, mobile shops and ambulatory hospitals, said James Kuffner, chief of Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development (TRI-AD).The operators of these vehicles could control when and where they are deployed and oversee their maintenance, he told reporters at the opening of its new offices in Tokyo.“It will take more time to achieve ‘Level 4�� for a personally-owned vehicle,�� Kuffner said, referring to the automation level at which vehicles can drive themselves under limited conditions.“Level 4 is really what we’re striving for to first appear in mobility as a service,�� he added.Toyota is set to release its first so-called ‘Level 2�� autonomous car capable of driving itself on the highway, as part of its strategy to develop self-driving cars over the next few decades.Toyota and its suppliers, including Denso Corp, which also invests in TRI-AD, is adopting a longer view toward cars with self-driving technology and artificial intelligence (AI) than many competitors that already market vehicles capable of autonomous highway driving.Many of Toyota’s rivals, however, have pared development targets after fatal accidents in Tesla Inc cars have shown the complexity of autonomous technology even as they need to clear high regulation hurdles.	-1.870140786

EditorsNote: 1st graf, take out Toyota Center; 2nd graf, say inside three minutes, not two; 10th graf, adds Barea referenceJames Harden and Russell Westbrook combined for 67 points and the undersized Houston Rockets squared their season series against the visiting Dallas Mavericks with a 128-121 win Friday.Harden posted 35 points, a season-high 16 rebounds, six assists and four steals. He drilled a pair of 3-pointers inside the final three minutes to stymie the Mavericks, who cut an 18-point deficit late in the third quarter to 107-104 when Delon Wright converted a wide-open layup with just under seven minutes remaining.Dallas, playing without All-Star guard Luka Doncic (right ankle sprain), stayed in the fight until Harden closed out the victory with his precision shooting.Westbrook added 32 points, six rebounds, nine assists and three steals. The Rockets nearly played Dallas to a draw on the glass despite featuring no one capable of keeping Mavericks center Kristaps Porzingis (35 points, 12 rebounds) in check.Curiously, the Mavericks rallied with Porzingis on the bench, as Seth Curry (16 points) and Wright played feature roles.Tim Hardaway Jr. added 15 points for the Mavericks. Eric Gordon tallied 17 points for Houston.With center Clint Capela sidelined by a heel contusion, the Rockets leaned fully into playing small. That strategy included starting undersized power forward P.J. Tucker at center and spacing the floor on offense.But in order for that gambit to work, the Rockets had to thrive from the perimeter, and they did, connecting on 8 of 14 3-pointers in the opening period to get rolling.Harden wasn’t part of that early barrage, missing 6 of 7 shots in the first quarter. But Harden warmed up in the second, scoring 14 points on 4-of-8 shooting, including three treys.Dallas had Porzingis to thank for keeping the game close. He had 17 points by the break and combined with Dorian Finney-Smith and J.J. Barea to grab five offensive rebounds in the second period after the Mavericks failed to snag one of their errant attempts in the first period.Houston led by just five at the break despite shooting a robust 12 of 23 from deep.

(Adds detail, more comment from Lexus official)TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug 5 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus brand is planning to launch a second top-of-the-line “flagship�� model to accompany a new generation of its LS sedan, the head of the brand’s U.S. operations told Reuters on Wednesday.“We need a flagship. It doesn’t have to be a sedan,�� Jeff Bracken, Lexus division general manager, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference.Bracken noted the success of luxury sport utility vehicles such as Tata Motors�� Land Rover brand, the Cadillac Escalade from General Motors Co and large SUVs coming from the German luxury automakers.Luxury SUV sales have grown more quickly than sales of large luxury sedans, which have for decades anchored the top ends of the model lines of luxury auto brands. The SUV surge has prompted even luxury brands with no history of selling SUVs, such as BMW’s Rolls-Royce, to develop models to compete in the super luxury SUV segment.U.S. sales have been supported by a prolonged drop in gasoline prices. Average prices at the pump on Tuesday were $2.63, down 25 percent from a year ago, according to the AAA travel group.“In addition to the LS (a large sedan), there could be another flagship in our lineup,�� Bracken said. “We’ll define what it is in January.”Lexus also is looking to strengthen its SUV lineup by offering a version of the midsize RX SUV with a third row seat. An RX with room for seven or eight passengers is the No. 1 request from U.S. Lexus dealers, Bracken said. A new RX is due this fall but will not have a third row seat.“We don’t want to wait for a next generation�� to add the extra seating row, Bracken said.

* GM, Ford, Nissan China sales contract in August* Contrasts with double-digit gains for Toyota, Honda, Daimler* Overall market sales release set for ThursdayBEIJING, Sept 7 (Reuters) - General Motors Co reported on Monday its biggest drop in China sales in five months for August as global automakers struggle with a deepening economic slowdown and slumping equities in the world’s largest auto market.Vehicle sales for GM and its joint venture partners fell 4.8 percent year-on-year in August, while Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd also reported contracting sales for the month, highlighting the divide between winners and losers in the Chinese market.The figures contrast sharply with last week’s major sales gains for Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Mercedes maker Daimler AG in China, demonstrating the importance of having fresh, in-demand products to entice buyers.China’s economy is forecast to grow at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century this year. Mainland stock markets have tumbled roughly 40 percent since mid-June after a sharp run-up that began late last year.Mercedes offers a fresher lineup than key luxury competitors in China, having revamped many of its models more recently than Audi AG and BMW AG and helping to lift its deliveries last month by 53.1 percent.And in the past year, Honda and Toyota have released hot-selling sports utility vehicles (SUVs), a segment that IHS Automotive predicts will grow by more than 20 percent this year in defiance of the auto market’s slowdown.Automakers like GM are now trying to play catch-up.The U.S. automaker launched a new SUV in July under its Baojun budget brand, but the marque’s nearly three-fold sales growth year-to-date hasn’t been enough to lift the company’s relatively flat 2015 sales.The sales numbers of GM, Ford and Nissan bode poorly for overall market sales in August. Industry sales for the January to July period were up only 0.4 percent on a year-on-year basis, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - By day, the Daikoku Parking Area hums with transport trucks en route to and from the Port of Yokohama. On weekend evenings, it transforms into a revved-up runway of tuned-up Japanese cars.The unassuming rest stop is famous to car enthusiasts as a temple of the country’s motor culture, but it also illustrates a “youth�� problem that auto companies such as Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co are scrambling to address.The crowd last Friday - around 50 supercar fans who huddled around the back of a loading truck to get a first glimpse of the latest Lamborghini Huracan Performante delivered days before to collector Takeshi Kimura - were mainly men in their 40s and 50s.“Today’s young people, they came of age during the recession, and some of them didn’t grow up with a family car,�� said Kimura, who has earned a reputation on Japanese social media as an ambassador of car culture thanks to stunts including coasting his Ferrari F40 down ski slopes and racing his supercars around a driving school practice course.“As a result, people hit their 20s and they’re not aware of how fun cars can be.”On top of that, the cars whose finely-tuned growls echoed beneath the overpasses that criss-cross the Daikoku lot are mostly from the 1990s heyday of Japan’s auto industry.Back then, Honda Motor Co, Nissan and their compatriots forged a global reputation for their stylish, fast, highly engineered cars. Drifting, the technique of sliding rear-wheel-drive cars through bends that entered popular culture through films like the Fast and the Furious franchise, was born on Japan’s winding roads.Today, even those young Japanese who do get the car bug are unimpressed by the domestic choices on offer.“These days automakers just aren’t making cars I’d want to drive,�� said Sho Watabe, a 20-year-old student who had rocked up to Daikoku in his 1996 Mazda RX-7.“If you look at the way cars are designed these days, they all look the same. They all lack personality ... If automakers keep making the same types of cars, young people are going to continue turning away from them.”Japanese car makers for years have grappled with falling interest in cars among young people, which, along with a rapidly greying society, has led to a 17 percent fall in domestic vehicle sales since 2000, data from the Japan Auto Dealers Association shows.The number of Japanese license holders aged under 30 has dropped 35 percent since 2001, according to National Police Agency data, even as the total number of license holders has increased around 9 percent during the same period.The country’s tuning culture, once known among global car fans for its focus on squeezing as much speed as possible out of mass-market models, is also losing its pep, as complex control units and sensors make cars increasingly hard to tinker with.To appease car enthusiasts and drum up more interest among young people, Toyota last month launched a new line of customized, sporty versions of the Prius, Yaris and other existing models in Japan under its Gazoo racing brand, which feature sports car tuning and racing trims.Nissan is also marketing more sportier siblings of its flagship models, unveiling racing versions of its Leaf electric car and its Serena minivan at the Tokyo Motor Show this week.“Mass market consumers want reliable, convenient cars, but we want to position Gazoo as a platform to use our ��secret sauce��, to use our tuning capabilities to attract car fans,�� Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters last month.To raise brand awareness among young car fans, Toyota and a growing number of automakers and suppliers are tapping the country’s drifting culture, which has cleaned up its image after being associated for years with illegal road racing.“We don’t participate in motor sports in a big way, so we weren’t registering with young drivers, a small but important market for us,�� said Junichi Sugano, a spokesman at Toyo Tires, known domestically as a specialist in minivan tires, which was a sponsor of the first-ever FIA Intercontinental Drift Cup held earlier this month in Tokyo.“People who attend drift events, not all of them drift, a lot of them drive minivans.”Longer term, Toyota has also promised to expand its sports car line-up, stoking anticipation of a revival of its popular Supra model.Back at Daikoku, Kimura, who set up Car Guy, a crew of car enthusiasts, has some advice for Japanese manufacturers.“If Japanese automakers want more young people to buy their cars, they have to come up with truly stylish and unique cars,�� he said. “They need to come to places like this and show cars that will get kids�� hearts racing.��	1.408677453
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge signed off on Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T $1.2 billion settlement of criminal charges that it concealed safety problems in its vehicles, an accord that could serve as a model for a similar probe into General Motors Co GM.N.U.S. District Judge William Pauley approved the Japanese automaker’s deferred prosecution agreement at a Thursday hearing in Manhattan.His approval came one day after the U.S. Department of Justice said it resolved its investigation into problems that caused Toyota vehicles to accelerate suddenly.Pauley said the case presented a “reprehensible picture of corporate misconduct,�� and expressed hope that the government would ultimately hold the responsible decisionmakers at Toyota accountable.“This unfortunately is a case that demonstrates that corporate fraud can kill,�� he said.Pauley ruled shortly after Christopher Reynolds, Toyota’s North American legal chief, entered a “not guilty�� plea on behalf of the automaker to one count of wire fraud.The $1.2 billion settlement is the largest such penalty ever levied by the United States on an auto company. It resolves issues that have dogged Toyota since at least 2007 and have been linked to at least five deaths. Toyota still faces hundreds of private lawsuits.The settlement marked a huge victory for safety advocates who fought for years for criminal prosecution of automakers over safety violations.Toyota agreed to a so-called statement of facts, in which it admitted to having misled U.S. consumers and a federal regulator about two problems that caused cars to accelerate even if drivers tried to slow them down.No guilty plea was required, and the government agreed not to prosecute Toyota for wire fraud for three years. The charge will be dismissed in 2017 if Toyota follows the terms of the accord, which include allowing an independent monitor to review its safety practices.A spokeswoman for Toyota declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan.U.S. authorities are investigating GM over its handling of an ignition switch defect linked to 12 deaths, and which resulted in a recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles, mostly in the United States.Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters on Wednesday that he hoped the Toyota deal would “serve as a model for how to approach future cases involving similarly situated companies.”The Toyota investigation flowed out of publicity starting in 2009 over unintended acceleration linked to at least five deaths, and which prompted hundreds of lawsuits.Last year, a federal judge approved a settlement valued at $1.6 billion to resolve claims by Toyota owners that the value of their cars dropped because of the negative publicity.The case is U.S. v. Toyota Motor Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-cr-00186.	0.9571601152

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An executive with the Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp was indicted on Thursday for conspiring to fix the prices of seat belts sold to carmakers, the U.S. Justice Department said.The indictment is the latest in a global probe of price fixing of auto parts. A total of 32 companies have pleaded guilty or agreed to do so and 50 executives have taken a plea bargain or been indicted in the investigation.Hiromu Usuda, a sales executive for Takata from 2005 to 2011, is accused of meeting with executives of other companies that make seat belts to reach agreements on what they would charge, the department said.The affected automakers were Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Nissan Motor Co, Mazda Motor Corp and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, which makes Subaru cars, the department said.Efforts to reach Usuda for comment through Takata were unsuccessful.The Justice Department and other antitrust enforcers worldwide have been investigating price fixing of more than 30 car parts, including air-conditioning systems, power window motors and power steering components.	5.645534475

* German consumer body seeks compensation for VW buyers* Dealers want more information quickly from VW* Not yet clear which models, years affected* Fuel efficiency trumps environment concern?* Trust in cars intact, not in company - dealer (Recasts with more dealer comment)By Emma Thomasson and Paul SandleBERLIN/LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Motor dealers and consumer groups alike expressed frustration on Thursday at a lack of information from Volkswagen about the implications for customers of a scandal involving diesel cars rigged to pass U.S. emissions.“We are getting lots of phone calls asking ‘What is the likely impact of this?’� said an insider at a major Volkswagen dealership in Britain, who declined to be named.“But we not getting anything from Volkswagen, so we don’t have anything to pass on to them.”The same was true in Frankfurt: a women at the reception desk of a VW dealership, who declined to give her name, said she had received many queries from diesel car drivers.“But we haven’t got the ultimate answer because we haven’t got much information from Volkswagen,�� she said.The German group has set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to help cover the costs of the crisis and said that 11 million of its cars could be affected worldwide, but has not yet announced a recall.VW said in a statement on its websites that it could not say which models and years of construction were affected, adding it would provide further information as soon as possible.“It goes without saying that we will take full responsibility and cover costs for the necessary arrangements and measures. But this process will take time,�� VW said.Italian consumer group Altroconsumo said it, along with similar organisations in other European countries, was planning to write to Volkswagen demanding clear information on the situation immediately.Klaus Mueller, head of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, said Volkswagen must compensate any consumers affected and retrofit all affected vehicles. “Volkswagen is called upon to comprehensively clear this up,�� he said.Lawyers have already brought class actions on behalf of scores of car owners in the United States and Italian consumer group Codacons is collecting signatures for a potential suit.Market research company YouGov said it had recorded a big hit to the VW brand in the United States and Britain, where VW has tumbled into the lowest position among 34 brands.In an attempt to reassure customers, VW said new diesel models covered by the European Union’s Euro 6 emissions standards met legal requirements. The software in question did not affect handling or consumption, or control emissions, it added.However, in a Swedish Volkswagen Golf chat room, consumers were discussing whether it will be possible to cancel recent orders, with one person saying he had been planning to purchase a hatchback, but decided never to buy VW again due to the scandal.“We expect environmentally sensitive consumers will increasingly pay attention to emissions and avoid diesel-powered cars,�� said Raffael Wuethrich, project leader for sustainability and energy at the Swiss Foundation for Consumer Protection.Tim Pollard, executive editor of Britain’s Car Magazine, agreed: “The actual topic of emissions is a bit of a dry topic, but they (consumers) do understand that it affects the tax they pay and the amount of money in their pocket.”Ernst-Robert Nouvertne, who owns VW dealerships in the German town of Solingen, said how quickly VW refitted affected cars would be critical to reassuring customers.“Customers are unsettled. It won’t just pass us by without problems. Some customers could switch to a petrol car,�� he said, but noted Volkswagen should be shielded by the loyalty of its customers, at least in its home country.Steve Young, managing director of auto industry research firm ICDP, said the experience of previous car recalls by other brands showed it could actually bring dealerships more business.Young noted how Toyota Motor Corp had recalled millions of vehicles from 2009 due to some customers�� complaints that their cars were unintentionally accelerating.“It depends on how well they manage the process... in the case of the Toyota recall in the U.S., Toyota dealers were able to reconnect with customers,�� he said.“If the dealer handles it well, they could help customers use the compensation to switch into petrol and sell their fixed diesel model to somebody who knows what they are getting.”Ansgar Klein, head of the German Association of Independent Dealerships, does not expect a lasting impact.“The Golf has not got worse. I don’t think prices will fall as a result,�� he said. “Most drivers care more about fuel consumption than emissions. The scandal has not affected trust in VW cars, although trust in the company has suffered.”Dariusz Balcerzyk from the Automotive Market Research Institute Samar in Warsaw said the same was true in Poland.“For Poles this is not really that much of an issue. For a Polish customer, it is still the price that matters most, followed by the car’s brand,�� he said.

May 18 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp :* Toyota says will continue production on all vehicle assembly lines in Japan from May 23 through 28 Source text: bit.ly/24YyVOn Further company coverage: (Reporting By Chris Gallagher)	1.684231262
TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it would recall 6.5 million vehicles globally to fix a defect in the power window switch in models including the Yaris/Vitz subcompact, Corolla, Camry and others.Of the total, about 2.7 million are in North America, 1.2 million in Europe, and 600,000 in Japan, the automaker said. It said it was not aware of any crashes caused by the glitch.Toyota said modules in the power window master switch may have been lubricated inconsistently during the manufacturing process. Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short circuit. That in turn could cause the switch assembly to overheat and melt, and potentially lead to a fire, it said.Among other models subject to the recall are the Matrix, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia and Scion xB. The vehicles were produced between January 2005 and December 2010, Toyota said.Toyota also issued a separate recall in Japan of about 140,000 Crown and Crown Majesta models for a glitch that could cause the hood to open inadvertently.

TOKYO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Companies in central Japan have been spared the hit from China’s economic slowdown thanks to brisk automobile exports to the United States, a senior Bank of Japan official said on Monday.“The negative impact of China’s slowdown is diminishing compared with last year,�� said Toru Umemori, head of the BOJ’s Nagoya branch overseeing the Tokai central Japan region - home to auto giant Toyota Motor Corp.He also told a news conference that recent declines in oil prices are unlikely to have a big impact on companies�� inflation expectations.In a quarterly report on the regional economies of Japan released on Monday, the BOJ revised up its assessment on central Japan to say it is “expanding moderately.�� (Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Chris Gallagher)	-6.581464093
* Toyota to buy 13 mln inflators from Nippon Kayaku -sources* The deal would run from July next year to 2020* Toyota has recalled 12 mln vehicles with Takata inflators* Takata inflators linked to 8 deaths and more than 100 injuries* Deal is a precaution in case of further recalls -source (Adds analyst comment, details on pressure on Takata to recall all cars with its air bags)By Maki ShirakiTOKYO, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, in a bid to reduce its risk from potentially lethal air-bag inflators supplied by Takata Corp, will buy millions of them from smaller parts maker Nippon Kayaku Co, people familiar with the matter said.The Japanese carmaker asked the second-tier supplier last month to increase production so it can supply Toyota with more than 13 million inflators from next July until 2020, said a person with direct knowledge of the deal and a second individual who was briefed on it.The move is the most proactive yet by manufacturers affected by the world’s biggest automotive recall, which has prompted more than 10 automakers to recall tens of millions of vehicles since 2008 to replace Takata air bags.Takata air-bag inflators have been linked to eight deaths and more than 100 injuries after exploding with excessive force, spraying shrapnel inside vehicles. Automakers are bearing the cost of most recalls while the root cause is investigated.Lawmakers in the United States have urged Takata to recall immediately all cars equipped with the company’s air bags, a demand that could affect more than 50 million cars on U.S. roads.Toyota based the amount of Nippon Kayaku purchases on the number of vehicles with Takata-made inflators it thinks could become dangerous as the cars age over the next few years, the people said.If Toyota switches to Nippon Kayaku inflators, it “will replace the high-risk ones, in other words the older ones, first and then proceed sequentially�� to newer inflators, one individual said.Takata has said long-term exposure to heat and high humidity can make its air bags deploy too forcefully. All the vehicles recalled so far are at least five years old.Toyota asked Nippon Kayaku, a century-old company that also manufactures chemicals and pharmaceuticals, to expand its production facilities to meet the demand, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential.Tokyo-based Nippon Kayaku could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for Toyota declined to comment.Shares in Nippon Kayaku were up as much as 2.9 percent after the initial Reuters report. They were down later, but still outperforming the wider market. Shares in Toyota and Takata were both down, in line with the market.The sources declined to say how much the purchases would cost Toyota, but average inflator prices suggest a total of around $100-$150 million.Toyota considers a switch to Nippon Kayaku inflators as a precaution in case further recalls are required, said the person with direct knowledge of the deal.Toyota, which has to date recalled more than 12 million vehicles with Takata-made air-bag inflators, is a pioneer of lean manufacturing and keeps minimal inventory to reduce costs and improve efficiency.After being criticised for acting too slowly on a separate major recall crisis of its own five years ago, Toyota, which vies with Volkswagen as the world’s biggest carmaker, wants to be able to replace at-risk inflators promptly if it needs to, the sources said.The move does not mean Toyota will stop buying Takata inflators, one of the individuals said. Toyota “won’t do anything to crush Takata��, he added.“Toyota wouldn’t want its business with Takata to disappear ... This is a strategy where it’s trying to maintain business and reduce risk,�� said Takaki Nakanishi, chief executive of Nakanishi Research Institute, which specialises in the automotive industry.“As for Takata, even if its inflator business shrinks, it can certainly still survive as an air-bag maker if it buys inflators from other companies,�� he added.Takata uses inflators made by supplier Daicel Corp as well as its own, and this has increased with the demand for replacements since the recall.The person with direct knowledge of the deal would not say whether Toyota is helping Nippon Kayaku pay for its expansion, or whether Toyota would keep buying its inflators after 2020.Nippon Kayaku employs almost 5,200 staff on a consolidated basis. Total group sales in the year to end-March rose 1.1 percent to nearly 162 billion yen ($1.3 billion).Previously Honda Motor Co helped Daicel finance a production increase to meet demand for replacement air bags, said a person familiar with that deal, and Sweden’s Autoliv Inc has also boosted production of replacement inflators at automakers�� requests.

DETROIT, March 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp : * Says us sales in February down 4.3 percent to 159,284 vehicles	-2.039753494
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s three leading automakers expect a stronger yen will cost them around $14 billion in lost operating profit this year alone - just as they need to invest more in everything from cleaner fuel to driver-less cars.After three years of supernormal profits on the back of a weaker currency, Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor now face a reality check as the yen has turned around.While the recent years�� currency boon has filled automakers�� coffers - Toyota alone has around $10 billion in cash - a squeeze on margins will put them under pressure to focus their investments, analysts say.“How to respond to yen rises while securing profits and continuing future investments: this balance is important,�� Toyota Executive Vice President Takahiko Ijichi said this week.The U.S. dollar climbed roughly 60 percent against the yen between late-2011 and mid-2015, a huge windfall for Japan’s car makers, but so far this year it is down roughly 9 percent against the Japanese currency.Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, has forecast a 40 percent drop in operating profits this year because of the stronger yen - a 935 billion yen ($8.6 billion) hit for a company that exported nearly half its Japanese production last year. Honda forecast a 303 billion yen hit to its operating profit, while Nissan expects a “massive impact�� of 255 billion yen on its operating profit.Even automakers that have invested more in local production outside Japan expect some currency pain. Suzuki Motor Corp, which through its Maruti Suzuki venture has almost 50 percent market share in India, expects annual net profit to fall by a fifth.This is all money that could be invested in cleaner alternative propulsion systems, technology to link cars to data services and the development of autonomous driving.In the United States, for example, General Motors has invested $500 million in ride-sharing service Lyft to develop an on-demand network of autonomous vehicles. It also bought Cruise Automation, a San Francisco start-up focused on developing driver-less cars.Toyota has said it would set up a research and development company to focus on artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley, in a departure from its cautious stance on automated driving.Japan’s ‘big three�� automakers are, however, verging on the conservative with their assumed yen rate of 105 to the dollar, which is more downbeat than a Reuters poll of foreign exchange analysts, which forecast the yen easing to 115 per dollar by next April.And that is already having an impact.Toyota forecast its smallest rise - just over 2 percent - in R&amp;D spending in four years, to 1.1 trillion yen in 2017.“We’re seeing a double whammy of yen strength combined with Japan Inc’s tendency to give very conservative guidance,�� said Stefan Worrall, director of Japan equity sales at Credit Suisse.“So you have to acknowledge some uncertainty over how much capex will actually be impacted by the stronger yen because we’re unsure just how much exaggeration we’re seeing in dim earnings forecasts.”Nissan, whose development capacities may be boosted by a proposed tie-up with Mitsubishi Motors, has ramped up production of its Rogue crossover SUV in Japan, a model that has been selling well in the United States. That made sense when the yen was weak, less so now.But capacity constraints mean Nissan has little hope of altering its plans to increase Japan production.“We’re not using it as a strategy, we’re using it as an opportunity. We have capacity available in Japan and no capacity available in North America,�� said CEO Carlos Ghosn.He called the stronger yen a “massive headwind��.In the short term, companies will look to rein in costs, analysts say - and that could be bad news for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to stimulate a stalled economic recovery, as salaries will likely be a prime target.	0.862924023
Beijing, June 1 (Reuters) - Sales in China by Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. and its two local joint-venture partners doubled in May from a year earlier to about 78,700 vehicles, a company spokesman said on Friday, noting the base effect from last year’s earthquake.For the first five months of this year, the Japanese auto maker sold a total of about 372,000 vehicles, a 26.1 percent increase from the same period last year, said the spokesman, Hitoshi Yokoyama.Yokoyama said the year-on-year jump of 105 percent in May was due chiefly to the fact that sales during the same month last year were affected by the earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan. The earthquake paralyzed production of key components and affected Toyota’s vehicle production around the world, including in China.Yokoyama said the Japanese auto maker expects to meet its sales goal of selling a total of one million cars in China this year.Toyota’s China sales in 2011 totaled about 883,400 vehicles, a 4.4 percent increase from 2010, reflecting in part the general slowdown of automobile sales in China last year.After rapid growth in 2009 and 2010, China’s auto market as a whole slowed considerably last year as sales of smaller-engine cars and commercial vehicles stalled after the government ended some incentives for car buyers.Various industry forecasts point to overall vehicle sales this year growing about 5 percent to 10 percent from 2011.Toyota would have to grow sales by about 13 percent this year to meet its goal of selling one million vehicles.

TOKYO, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp sold more cars than Volkswagen AG for the fifth consecutive month in November, putting the Japanese firm on track to remain the world’s top-selling automaker in 2015 as sales at the German maker suffer following a diesel emissions scandal.Toyota on Friday said group vehicle sales totalled 9.21 million in the January-November period, more than the 9.10 million cars delivered by Volkswagen during the same period. Toyota has continuously outsold Volkswagen on a year-to-date basis since July.Earlier this month, Volkswagen said its Volkswagen brand sales fell 2.2 percent year-on-year in November, extending a slide seen since October, the first full month after Europe’s biggest automaker admitted that it cheated diesel emissions tests in some of its cars.Group sales at Toyota in the year through November eased 1.0 percent from the previous year, while Volkswagen group sales for the same period fell 1.7 percent.	-8.885675263
"(Reuters) - Shares of Con-Way Inc CNW.N could jump by as much as 20 percent by year-end after the U.S. trucking company finishes overhauling its business as the country's economy recovers, business weekly Barron's said in its June 24 edition.The company has suffered for several years as the economy stalled, leading to price wars between trucking companies competing for a falling volume of freight traffic.Barron’s said Con-Way’s profit margins had dropped to 2 percent in the first quarter of this year from 9.5 percent in 2006 and that the company’s market share has been languishing at 10 percent for years.“Investors shouldn’t despair,�� Barron’s wrote.“Con-Way is about halfway through a costly, three-year overhaul of its operations that should pay off in improved earnings and a share price that could rise this year as much as 20 percent above last week’s $39,�� the paper said.The overhaul involves a ""lean"" approach to the business, created by Japanese carmaker Toyota 7203.T, that saves costs through cutting processes, shifting decision making to the frontline, introducing a new pricing mechanism and a new logistical system.Analysts have noticed the changes at Con-Way, but Barron’s said if the changes are not implemented successfully, heads could roll."	10.21196258
NAGOYA, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Denso Corp forecast that revenue for its safety and automated driving systems will rise by 60 percent by 2020 as the auto parts supplier plans to focus more on driver-assist functions, increasingly becoming a common feature on cars.The world’s second-largest parts maker, which generates roughly half its revenue from Toyota Motor Co, on Friday said that it expected revenue for active safety systems to hit 1 trillion yen ($8.30 billion) in 2020, from around 630 billion yen in the year ended March.Safety functions generated roughly 15 percent of the company’s total revenue during the year ended March.Global automakers and technology giants are competing to get ahead in a race to develop self-driving cars, with Toyota, Nissan Motor Co, Google and other companies aiming to have cars with varying levels of self-driving functions on the roads by 2020.Google and Ford Motor Co are in talks about forming a partnership to develop autonomous car technology, Reuters reported this week.Growing demand for driver-assist functions has raised the role of technology and software in auto manufacturing, an area which had long been dominated by mechanical engineering.“We’re not expecting self-driving functions to be a big area for revenue growth in 2020,�� Denso executive vice president Yasushi Yamanaka told reporters at a briefing in Nagoya, western Japan.“But we anticipate that safety features like automatic braking, lane keeping and other safety features like the ones we developed for the new Toyota Prius will drive big growth through 2020.”Denso’s push further into software development comes as the company faces increased overseas competition from suppliers including Germany’s Robert Bosch and Continental AG , the latter of which also supplies automated driving technology to Toyota.To compete more effectively with global parts suppliers and a growing number of venture technology firms, Denso said it was establishing a section within the company specialising in advanced driver assistance systems, based in Tokyo.

* Big firms�� pay raises bigger than expected* Companies responded to government pressure* Base pay won’t offset tax hike, but some bonuses generous* Higher base pay needed for sustainable economic recovery (Adds details, quotes throughout)By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Yoko KubotaTOKYO, March 12 (Reuters) - Big Japanese companies such as Toyota Motor Corp offered the most generous pay raises in years on Wednesday, a victory for the government’s efforts to defeat deflation, but workers will still struggle to offset a looming sales tax increase.Under heavy pressure from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to help kick-start a durable recovery with hefty pay increases, major firms like Toyota, Hitachi Ltd and Panasonic Corp responded more generously than some experts had expected to union wage demands.Still, this first batch of companies in Japan’s annual “spring labour offensive�� represent the bluest of the blue chips; the vast majority of Japanese employees work for smaller companies that haven’t benefited as much from “Abenomics.”Japanese companies are enjoying bumper profits thanks to Abe’s massive stimulus policies and the resulting weak yen. But this year the companies had to take on not only their unions but also the ostensibly pro-business Abe administration.Economy Minister Akira Amari, who on Tuesday had threatened unspecified action against “uncooperative�� companies, said on Wednesday that “the management side responded above expectations�� and that their pay offers would become “a big driving force for escaping deflation and reviving the economy.”Increases in base pay and seniority increases amount to 2.2-2.3 percent for major firms, while small and mid-size companies are offering over 2 percent, reckoned Hisashi Yamada, chief economist at the Japan Research Institute.That won’t cover the 3 percentage-point increase in the sales tax, taking effect on April 1, but some big firms were generous with bonuses, putting workers comfortably ahead, at least for now.As recently as February, a Reuters survey of big companies found more than 80 percent were not planning to raise base pay and most would not offer enough total compensation increases to offset the sales tax hike.Government spending and the Bank of Japan’s enormous asset purchases have made a start in dragging the world’s third-biggest economy out of 15 years of deflation and uncertain growth, but a durable recovery needs a cycle of rising profits, wages and prices.Toyota, a benchmark on pay raises, will give its Japan-based workers their biggest raise in monthly pay in 21 years in the business year starting in April.Base pay, a critical component that is hard for companies to reverse during downturns, will rise by 2,700 yen ($26.20) a month, the first increase in six years but less than its union’s demand for a 4,000 yen increase.Including bonuses, total compensation will rise 7.6 percent.The world’s biggest carmaker clearly felt it had to fall in line.“There is a certain role that (our) labour and management are expected to fulfil in order for the Japanese economy to step out of deflation and attain a virtuous cycle,�� Toyota Senior Managing Officer Naoki Miyazaki told reporters at the auto maker’s headquarters in Toyota City, central Japan.“We feel that we have fulfilled our role and we hope that the salary hike trend would spread to various areas.”But while Nissan Motor Co, Japan’s No.2 carmaker by global sales volume, met workers�� demands for a 3,500 yen raise in monthly base pay and a hefty bonus, small-car specialist Daihatsu Motor Co offered just 800 yen, citing increased competition in Japan and a slowdown in Indonesia.Many Japanese firms remain wary of raising base pay due to doubts about over the recovery’s sustainability and concern about higher fixed personnel costs, which are hard to shed during downturns.Honda Motor Co. raised base pay 2,200 yen, below the union’s demand of 3,500 yen, saying business was improving but “we are still midway through structural reform and making our domestic operations more independent.”Among electronics makers, Hitachi, the largest manufacturing employer in Japan with more than 200,000 workers, and Panasonic said they would boost their monthly base wage by 2,000 yen, half of what their unions requested.For the thousands of companies below the top tier - which employ the vast majority of Japanese workers - compensation is likely to be less generous.For example, when big car makers such as Toyota raise base pay for their workers, they can squeeze suppliers to cut costs, putting downward pressure on their wages and diluting the economic lift of the wage gains at the top.

* Domestic car sales have risen for a second straight year* 2018 sales may hit 1 million, the most in 5 yrs - federation* Sales could contract 2-5 pct in 2019 - bank research unitBANGKOK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Thais will buy a million cars in 2018, a second year of strong sales, but growing household debt and an anticipated interest rate hike - potentially on Wednesday - spell a slowdown ahead for one of the country’s main economic drivers.The auto sector, accounting for one-tenth of Thai output, is a bright spot in an economy impacted by falling integrated circuit exports to China amid Sino-U.S. trade dispute, and fewer Chinese visitors after dozens of tourists died in a July boat accident.Four years of contracting car sales ended in 2017, when the number rose to 871,650 after a five-year ban on selling cars bought under a government subsidy scheme was lifted.“Sales are so strong that we have revised up this year’s target twice,�� said Surapong Paisitpattanapong of the Federation of Thai Industries�� auto division. “We should see a million cars this year.”But analysts doubt the strength will last. Thai households are among Asia’s biggest borrowers - owing some 77.5 percent of gross domestic product - and the central bank looks poised to hike rates at Wednesday’s meeting or the next one.Recently, lending for car-purchases has surged, helped by offers by some finance and leasing firms to approve loans within an hour. In July-September, auto loans rose 12.5 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2012.But delinquencies are high too. At the end of September, 7.32 percent of total current car loans were one- to three-months overdue.Bad loans could rise if there are interest rate hikes. These will “increase our cost of funds, affecting our margins and probably customers,�� said Tirachart Chiracharasporn, an executive at Thanachart Bank.The research unit of Kasikornbank predicts car sales this year will rise 18 percent but then shrink 2-5 percent in 2019.Komsorn Prakobpol, head of Tisco Securities�� strategy unit, sees growth next year but only of 5 percent at most.“Banks may get tougher on lending on concerns about loan quality,�� he said.Sales hit 1.44 million units in 2012, when the government car subsidy ended, so carmakers are still operating below that capacity and are in no rush to expand.“We can manage the current growth with existing resources ... the whole market is still below (peak),�� said Jean-Yves Jault, spokesman for Toyota Motor.But there are tweaks in strategy. Carmakers are shifting to hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) production, with the government providing tax incentives for the more eco-friendly cars.Toyota Motor Thailand is planning to begin production of HEV batteries in mid-2019 for its C-HR model, Jault said. Thailand’s Board of Investment has also approved electric vehicle projects by Mercedes-Benz , BMW , Nissan Motor and Honda.Overall this year, market leader Toyota - with about one-third of the Thai vehicle market - forecasts its sales growth of 31 percent, while rival Mazda expects 27 percent.But consumer confidence, which fell to six-month lows in November, does not bode well, car dealers say.“People who want to buy don’t have much spending power,�� said Sumete Patchuttorn, managing director of Mazda Mahachai.Prospective buyers like Panaschai Kongmun are thinking twice.“I have to see if I can afford it,�� said the 25-year-old company worker as he eyed a 900,000 baht ($27,450) Honda Civic.“The economy is not good now, I may have to say no��.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T automotive business in Europe will be profitable during its current fiscal year for the first time since 2007, Didier Leroy, the head of the Japanese automaker's European operations, said on Monday.The company believes its car business will continue to be profitable during its fiscal 2013 year, buoyed by new models and the growing popularity of hybrids in Europe, Leroy said during a media roundtable a day before the opening of the Geneva car show.Toyota’s fiscal 2012 ends in March.Hybrids will account for at least 17 percent of its sales in Europe this year, he said, up from 13 percent in 2012.Analysts said the weak yen is now allowing the company to offer higher incentives on its models, while still maintaining a good profit margin. Leroy said the automaker is enjoying the benefits of the weak yen, but that this is not a part of the automaker’s long-term strategy.“We don’t want to build our business model on the currency situation,�� he told reporters.	2.255566312
TOKYO/SHANGHAI, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp will begin production at its new Mexico factory in January, the carmaker’s chief said on Wednesday, describing the plant as a key foreign base for the Japanese company as it pares its reliance on domestic output.“I just visited the Mexican plant and all preparations are complete,�� Mazda’s head, Masamichi Kogai said at a press conference at the Tokyo Motor Show. “This factory will become a crucial overseas base for Mazda,�� he added.Selling just over a million cars a year and with most of its vehicles built in high-cost Japan, Mazda has struggled to compete with bigger automakers that are 10 times its size. In the four years to March 2012, the company chalked up combined net losses of nearly 250 billion yen ($2.5 billion).Since losing the backing of Ford Motor Co, which once owned a third of the Hiroshima-based company, Mazda has drawn closer to Toyota Motor Co winning access to its hybrid technology. Mazda will also build cars for Toyota at the Mexico plant.Meanwhile, the company’s China chief executive said Mazda had cut its 2013 China sales target by 7.5 percent to 185,000 vehicles due to tough competition from its rivals.Mazda now aims to sell about the same number of vehicles as last year, said Nobuhiko Watabe.“Competition is fierce and it’s not just from the other Japanese carmakers,�� Watabe told Reuters and other reporters in Shanghai last week, adding pressure was also coming from other foreign models such as Ford Motor Co.’s Focus.“It’s been a tough fight.”Most Japanese carmakers have only been making a tepid recovery since last year when sales were hammered by a flare up in anti-Japanese sentiment triggered by a territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing over tiny, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.“We had hoped to sell 200,000 units this year as the impact of the island dispute fades, but we’re now looking at more or less around last year’s level at 185,000,�� Watabe said at the small group interview.During the first 10 months of the year, Mazda sold a total of 142,571 vehicles, down 9.5 percent from a year earlier. Watabe said the drop in sales this year was also due to a high base from last year when strong demand for the Mazda3 Xingcheng boosted sales in the first half of 2012.Bigger Japanese rivals Toyota, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co have seen their sales rise 5 percent, 7 percent and 16 percent during the same period, respectively.Mazda was hoping to set a higher 2014 sales target compared with this year but had not yet finalised the figure, Watabe said.“Our CX-5 has been received very well and with the localisation in production of the ATENZA and Mazda3 planned for next year, we hoping to jump up from this year’s level,�� he added.China’s auto market has rebounded strongly from last year, with sales volume rising over 13 percent during the January-October period compared with a year earlier.Mazda recognises the importance of capturing demand in lower-tier cities where the economy has been expanding quicker than in major costal cities like Shanghai or Guangzhou, but needs to be careful in its strategy, Watabe said.“As growth slows in major cities, we need to shift inland. But cost efficiency in these areas are much lower because the population is dispersed,�� he added.	-5.04736884

(Adds Toyota President Akio Toyoda’s comments, information on U.S. District Judge hearing, Toyota share move)WASHINGTON/DETROIT, March 19 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will pay a record $1.2 billion to resolve a criminal probe into safety issues, in a deal that could serve as a template for how U.S. authorities approach a similar investigation into General Motors Co.The settlement between the Justice Department and Toyota includes an admission by the auto manufacturer that it misled American consumers about two different problems that caused cars to accelerate even as drivers tried to slow them down.The agreement comes as General Motors is also under investigation over its handling of an ignition switch failure linked to a dozen deaths. GM last month recalled more than 1.6 million vehicles 13 years after first noticing the issue. The payment Toyota agreed to marks the largest such penalty levied by the United States on an auto company, officials said.“My hope and expectation is that this resolution will serve as a model for how to approach future cases involving similarly situated companies,�� Attorney General Eric Holder told a news conference.Holder declined to discuss GM specifically but Preet Bharara, the chief U.S. prosecutor in Manhattan who joined him at the news conference, made a verbal slip and referred to the case against Toyota as one against GM. He quickly corrected himself.The Toyota settlement marked a huge victory for safety advocates who fought for years for criminal prosecution of automakers over safety violations.Although no individuals at Toyota were charged, the case was the first federal criminal case of its kind since the passage of the first U.S. auto safety law 48 years ago.“It means at the highest levels of the auto company, they have to worry about going to jail if they don’t report a defect,�� said Joan Claybrook, a former president of the nonprofit Public Citizen who favors stricter safety standards.Toyota President Akio Toyoda said the company has been working hard to change itself in the past few years.“It was a significant turning point that allowed us to go back to our basic philosophy of prioritising our customers,�� he told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday.The Japanese carmaker’s North American legal chief, Christopher Reynolds, said in a statement that the settlement serves to put an “unfortunate chapter�� behind the company.U.S. District Judge William Pauley, who must approve the deferred prosecution agreement that is a part of the pact, has scheduled a hearing for Thursday afternoon in New York regarding the settlement.Shares in Toyota have dropped 1.2 percent as of 12:40 p.m. Japan time (0340 GMT), roughly in line with the benchmark Nikkei that fell 1.5 percent.“EFFECTIVELY ON PROBATION”The settlement resolves issues that have dogged the company since at least 2007 and have been linked to at least five deaths. Toyota still faces hundreds of private lawsuits.Prosecutors agreed to defer and drop the criminal charges against Toyota if it abides by terms, including allowing an independent monitor to review the company’s safety practices.The monitor, who will be approved by the U.S. government but paid for by the company, will be able to interview executives, take part in some meetings on safety issues and will have a toll-free number for Toyota employees to anonymously report violations.The automaker must report defects to regulators within five days of determining the problems could affect safety.Toyota is “effectively on probation for three years,�� said Bharara, whose office conducted the investigation. “It cared more about savings than safety and more about its own brand and bottom line than the truth.”John Alan James, a governance professor at Pace University in New York, said such provisions in the Toyota deal could serve as a blueprint used by prosecutors in any deal with GM. “The Department of Justice enforcement division is all lawyers, and lawyers live on precedents,�� he said.The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan is investigating GM’s handling of its ignition-switch recall. GM faces probes by Congress and safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as lawsuits from GM drivers who say their cars lost value because of the defects.GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has been credited for apologizing quickly for the slow recall and promising to focus on safety. Toyota had played down the problems.However, GM is still under fire for failing to address the defective switches when they were discovered.A GM spokesman declined to comment on whether the Toyota settlement could be a model for his company.GM drivers have described accidents dating back to the mid-2000s in which engines spontaneously shut off, sending cars careening and disabling airbags before the vehicles crashed. Toyota drivers, by comparison, found themselves in vehicles cruising to speeds higher than 100 miles per hour while the brake pedals were functionally disabled.The 1966 Motor Vehicle Safety Act first required manufacturers of cars and trucks to notify the public of safety problems and to act if they find a defect.Congress has amended the law several times but did not add criminal penalties until 2000, and even then it was assumed bringing a case would be difficult.To prosecute Toyota, the Justice Department worked around those requirements by bringing its case under a wire fraud law that they use in cases from securities fraud to political corruption.A document prosecutors filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan says Toyota “defrauded U.S. consumers into purchasing its products by concealing information and making misleading statements about unintended acceleration.”Holder said federal prosecutors in New York “have been appropriately creative in crafting these mechanisms that can be used in similar kinds of cases to hold companies responsible for their actions.”Toyota said it would take a $1.2 billion after-tax charge for the settlement in the fiscal year ending March 31.Toyota dealers said customers have moved on. “It’s good to get this behind us, but we don’t hear about this at all from consumers,�� said Carl Swope, a Toyota dealer in Kentucky.‘LIES REPEATEDLY TOLD’The settlement resolves a four-year investigation by U.S. authorities, led by the New York FBI, which conducted more than 70 interviews.Federal regulators opened the 2007 inquiry into Toyota after reports of unintended acceleration by the Lexus ES350 model.The problems gained public attention two years later when a highway patrolman and his family were killed in an accident in San Diego that involved that model of Lexus.A 911 emergency call recounted the family’s last minutes: “We’re in a Lexus ... and we’re going north on 125 and our accelerator is stuck ... there’s no brakes ... hold on and pray ...�� The call ends with the sound of it crashing, prosecutors said.Toyota responded with a recall of millions of vehicles but left on the road some vehicles including the top-selling Corolla which was described within the company as having among the worst problems with floor mats that trapped acceleration pedals.The company also concealed from the public and regulators a separate problem with the acceleration pedal itself.In fact, the company canceled a design change to address the issue in the wake of the San Diego accident.“Idiots! Someone will go to jail if lies are repeatedly told. I can’t support this,�� one Toyota employee said after a meeting with regulators according to a statement of facts filed with the settlement.That employee’s comments came after he reviewed reports from Europe showing the severity of the problem.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, an early backer of hydrogen cars, has watched the electric rise of Tesla, including on its home turf. Now's it's going on the offensive in the battery-powered market led by its U.S. rival.The South Korean company plans to introduce two production lines dedicated to electrics vehicles (EVs), one next year and another in 2024, according to an internal union newsletter seen by Reuters.Euisun Chung, leader of the Hyundai Motor Group conglomerate that also includes Kia Motors, has also held a series of meetings since May with his counterparts at Samsung, LG and SK Group, which make batteries and electronic parts.The purpose of the talks, which were publicly announced, was for Hyundai to try to secure batteries at a time of tight supply as the race for EVs intensifies, according to several industry sources. Those manufacturers also supply the likes of Tesla TSLA.O, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and GM GM.N. Hyundai told Reuters it was collaborating with Korean battery suppliers “to scale up�� its electric car production efficiently. It declined to comment on any plans to introduce dedicated production lines.Samsung, LG and SK declined to comment.The moves indicate the carmaker is moving aggressively to expand its electric capacity, days after Chung announced on July 14 that Hyundai Motor Group aimed to sell 1 million battery EVs a year and grab a global market share of over 10% by 2025.There’s some way to go; Hyundai Motor Group sold 86,434 battery EVs last year, according to data from industry consultant LMC Automotive. That was above the 73,278 sold by Volkswagen Group but behind the 367,500 delivered by Tesla.Hyundai, the world's No.5 automaker together with Kia Motors 000270.KS, said its agility allowed it to lead the charge into EVs. ""We are certain Hyundai is never going to fall behind,"" it added.A senior Hyundai insider, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the company had not been concerned about Tesla when the Silicon Valley company was producing high-end cars.But it became more worried when Tesla brought out a cheaper Model 3 in 2017, according to the insider who described it as a “strategic victory��.No traditional automaker has been successful yet in catching up with Tesla, which retains an edge in battery and software technology.Hyundai could also face a roadblock from its powerful union, which is worried about job security as EVs require fewer components and workers than gasoline vehicles; at Hyundai, this is partly because the automaker makes a number of key components for conventional cars in-house, while many EV parts are outsourced at present.The union is pushing for the company to assemble key EV components, like battery packs and motors, in-house to offset any reduction in workforce.“We are not opposed to EV business. Kodak went bankrupt because it stuck to film even as the industry was shifting to digital photography,�� union spokesman Kwon Oh-kook told Reuters.“We just want to protect the jobs of our members,�� he said.Hyundai said automakers and unions needed to accelerate change to remain viable in the long term.Back in 2010, Hyundai Motor Co made 230 electric cars for the government, but they ended up being mothballed at a research center outside Seoul due to a lack of charging infrastructure, according to Lee Hyun-soon, R&amp;D chief at the time.In a 2014 book Lee, who developed South Korea’s first gasoline engines, said such electric vehicles were “not realistic��, also citing high battery costs, and that hydrogen cars - a rival clean technology - offered a “bright�� future.Along with Toyota 7203.T and Nikola NKLA.O, Hyundai was one of a few automakers to have backed hydrogen cars. It launched the industry's��first��mass-produced��hydrogen��car, Tucson��Fuel Cell, in 2013 and the NEXO in 2018. However the technology has not taken off; 7,707 hydrogen fuel cell cars were sold globally last year, compared with 1.68 million battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive.In Hyundai’s home market, Tesla had its best month in June, with its Model 3 beating Hyundai’s Kona EV, as well as premium models from BMW and Audi.“Hyundai did not expect Tesla to dominate the EV market so quickly,�� another person familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters.Hyundai Motor Co has a market capitalization of about 25.3 trillion won ($21.2 billion) - less than a tenth of that of Tesla, now the world’s most valuable automaker.While Hyundai promotes its hydrogen cars with K-pop boyband BTS, it only plans to introduce up to two hydrogen models by 2025, and 23 battery-powered models.Peter Hasenkamp, vice president at electric startup Lucid, who previously worked at Tesla and Ford, said established carmakers faced historical “inertia�� to make the EV transition.“Part of the reason we’re based in Silicon Valley is to leverage both software and electrical engineering expertise,�� Hasenkamp told Reuters.“You’ve got a couple of generations for the big car companies to learn really how to do this well. It is a lot harder than they thought it was.��"	6.456241033
Jan 24 (Reuters) - Group 1 Automotive, the fourth-largest U.S. auto dealer group, has agreed to buy Brazilian automotive retail firm UAB Motors Participacoes S.A for about $146 million in cash and stock, to expand into Brazil’s fast growing market.Group 1 said on Thursday it reached a definitive ageement to buy UAB for $47.4 million in cash and 1.45 million Group 1 shares, valuing the deal at about $145.6 million based on Group 1’s close on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.The U.S. auto dealer, which will also assume about $62 million of UAB debt, said the deal should be modestly accretive, adding 3 cents to 5 cents a share to its 2013 earnings.The deal will give Group 1 ownership of 18 dealerships -- two Toyota, four Nissan, two BMW, two BMW/MINI, three Renault, three Peugeot, one Land Rover and one Land Rover/Jaguar -- which are expected to generate about $650 million in annual revenues.“To enter one of the largest auto markets in the world with a well-established retail infrastructure and management team provides Group 1 and our shareholders with an incredible growth opportunity,�� Group 1 chief executive Earl Hesterberg said in a statement.The deal is expected to close around Feb. 28, 2013.	3.454734651
* Nikkei’s down 0.7 pct at 18,845 points* Support seen at 18,700 - analyst* Toyota drops on disappointing earnings forecast* Mining shares underperformBy Ayai TomisawaTOKYO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average dropped to a two-week low on Tuesday morning after global stocks fell and a stronger yen hurt overall sentiment, while Toyota Motor underperformed the market following a worse-than-expected earnings forecast.Investors remained cautious ahead of a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 10 and 11, with trade and currencies likely to be on their agenda.The Nikkei dropped 0.7 percent to 18,844.68 in midmorning trade, after falling to as low as 18,805.32, the lowest level since Jan 24.Traders said that investors have become risk averse, with global shares falling overnight on political and economic uncertainties, while a fall in oil prices soured the mood.In Asian trade, the dollar dropped to 111.625 yen, its lowest since late November as investors sought refuge in the safe-haven Japanese currency.“Since the dollar-yen dropped its support line, stocks are following suit,�� said Kazuhiro Takahashi, an equity strategist at Daiwa Securities.He said that for the short term, the Nikkei’s downside support is seen at 18,700.Mining shares declined, with Inpex Corp dropping 1.7 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co declining 0.9 percent.Oil fell on Monday as ample U.S. supplies and over-extended speculative long positions outweighed bulish factors, notably OPEC output curbs and rising tensions between the United States and Iran.Toyota Motor Corp underperformed, falling as much as 2.8 percent after its new operating profit forecast undershot market expectations.The broader Topix dropped 0.4 percent to 1,514.57 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 shed 0.3 percent to 13,576.05.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two major auto trade groups on Wednesday warned the Trump administration that imposing up to 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically hike prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.A coalition representing major foreign automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, BMW AG, and Hyundai Motor Co, said the tariffs would harm automakers and U.S. consumers. The administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose tariffs.“The greatest threat to the U.S. automotive industry at this time is the possibility the administration will impose duties on imports in connection with this investigation,�� wrote the Association of Global Automakers representing major foreign automakers. “Such duties would raise prices for American consumers, limit their choices, and suppress sales and U.S. production of vehicles.”The group added: “Rather than creating jobs, these tariffs would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs producing and selling cars, SUVs, trucks and auto parts.”On Friday Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all imports of EU-assembled cars. On Tuesday Trump said tariffs are coming soon. “We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it won’t take very long!�� Trump tweeted.The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Daimler AG, Toyota and others, urged the administration in separate comments filed Wednesday not to go forward.“We believe the resulting impact of tariffs on imported vehicles and vehicle components will ultimately harm U.S. economic security and weaken our national security,�� the group wrote, calling the tariffs a “mistake�� and adding imposing them “could very well set a dangerous precedent that other nations could use to protect their local market from foreign competition.”The Alliance said its analysis of 2017 auto sales data showed a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles would result in an average price increase of $5,800, which would boost costs to American consumers by nearly $45 billion annually.Automakers are concerned tariffs would mean less capital to spend on self-driving cars and electric vehicles.“We are already in the midst of an intense global race to lead on electrification and automation. The increased costs associated with the proposed tariffs may result in diminishing the U.S.�� competitiveness in developing these advanced technologies,�� the Alliance wrote.Toyota said in a statement Wednesday that new tariffs “would increase the cost of every vehicle sold in the country.�� The automaker said the tariffs would mean even a Toyota Camry built in Kentucky “would face $1,800 in increased costs.”Both automotive trade groups cited a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that the cost to U.S. jobs from the import duties would be 195,000 jobs and could be as high as 624,000 jobs if other countries retaliate.The German Association for Small and Medium-sized Businesses said the “pattern of rising protectionism is very likely to continue if the U.S. decide to impose tariffs on foreign automobiles and automobile parts, thus causing tremendous damage to both economies.”Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, a state that produced nearly 1 million vehicles and 1.7 million engines built by foreign automakers last year, urged the Commerce Department not to invoke the tariffs. She said job losses from new levies could be “devastating.”The proposed tariffs on national security grounds have been met by opposition among many Republicans in Congress.Trump has made the tariffs a key part of his economic message and repeatedly lamented the U.S auto sector trade deficit, particularly with Germany and Japan. Some aides have suggested that the effort is a way to try to pressure Canada and Mexico into making more concessions in ongoing talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the department aimed to wrap up the probe by late July or August. The Commerce Department plans to hold two days of public comments in July on its investigation of auto imports.The Commerce Department has asked if it should consider U.S. owned auto manufacturers differently than foreign automakers.The Association of Global Automakers rejected that contention, saying its members�� American workers “are no less patriotic or willing to serve their country in a time of crisis than any other Americans.”The group questioned national security as grounds to restrict auto imports. “America does not go to war in a Ford Fiesta,�� they added.The Alliance said “there is no basis to claim that auto-related imports are a threat to national security�� and noted that 98 percent of U.S. auto imports came from U.S. national security allies.	4.562708188
TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average slipped on Wednesday morning from the previous session’s near 26-year high as investors took their profits, dragging on financial and mining stocks.The Nikkei dropped 0.3 percent to 22,872.59 in mid-morning trade after touching as high as 22,953.18 on Tuesday, its highest level since January 1992, after foreign investors piled into Japanese companies, expecting strong earnings.Toyota Motor Corp bucked the weakness, rising as much as 1.8 percent to hit its highest since February 2016 after the company raised its annual operating profit forecast to 2.0 trillion yen from 1.85 trillion yen.It also said it will buy back 1.5 percent of its own shares, worth 250 billion yen.
